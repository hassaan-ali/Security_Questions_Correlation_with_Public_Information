With 23 Grand Slam titles, Williams rose from the public courts of Compton, California to shatter records and dominate the field.Serena Jameka Williams was born to parents Richard Williams and Oracene Price on September 26, 1981 in Saginaw, Michigan.
Williams is the youngest of Price's five daughters, who include fellow tennis superstar Venus Williams.
Richard Williams, a former sharecropper from Louisiana, was determined that daughters Serena and Venus would succeed in life.
Seeing opportunity in tennis, he and Oracene taught themselves the game from books and videos so that they could coach their children.
Richard moved the family to Compton, California, where Williams began intensive tennis training with her father and older sister around the age of three.
The Williams sisters practiced for hours every day on rundown public tennis courts.Williams joined the junior United States Tennis Association tour and by 1991 she ranked first in the 10-and-under division.
Richard then moved the family to Palm Beach, Florida, where the sisters trained with coach Rick Macci.
Richard kept Williams and her sister from competing in the junior tournaments, hoping to ensure that they would not burn out before turning professional.In 1995, at the age of 14, Williams made her professional debut at a qualifying event in Quebec City.
Fellow American Annie Miller defeated her soundly.
Williams did not play another professional match until 1997, but by the end of that year she rose to number 99 in the world rankings.
In 1998, Williams’s ranking rose to number 20 and she surpassed Monica Seles to become the fastest player to record five victories against Top 10 players.Williams graduated from Driftwood Academy in 1999 and soon after signed a $12 million endorsement deal with Puma.
She won her first Grand Slam title that year, when she defeated Martina Hingis 6-3, 7–6 to win the U.S. Open, and rose to number four in the world rankings.
Two years later, Williams lost to her sister in the U.S. Open final – it was the first time that sisters played against each other in a Grand Slam final since 1884.The African-American Williams and her sister made an immediate impact in the predominately white tennis world: their strength and athleticism on the court overmatched many opponents and their colorful, fashionable styles garnered media attention.
The Williams sisters are credited with ushering in the power era of women’s tennis, characterized by blindingly-fast serves and commanding groundstrokes.
They competed together as doubles partners, eventually winning 14 Grand Slam doubles titles.
They took gold at the 2000, 2008, and 2012 Olympics and are the winningest doubles tennis team in Olympic history.In 2001, Williams won California’s Indian Wells tournament for the second time.
Williams, along with her father and sister who were watching in the stands, claimed spectators hurled racial slurs their way while booing them.
Williams later described the racist treatment as traumatizing and she boycotted the tournament until 2015.Williams continued to amass victories and rise in the rankings.
In 2002, she won her second, third, and fourth Grand Slam titles at Roland-Garros (the French Open), Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open, respectively.
In each of those tournaments, she defeated her sister Venus in the final match.
On July 8, 2002 she reached the ranking of number one in the world, a position she held for 57 straight weeks.
In 2003, Williams won her first Australian Open, becoming one of only six women in the Open Era (post-1968) to complete a career Grand Slam (in which a player wins all four major championships).
Williams actually held all four titles at once, an accomplishment she dubbed “The Serena Slam.”However, 2003 also brought troubles for Williams.
She underwent knee surgery in August and in September her older sister, Yetunde Price, was murdered in Los Angeles.
The loss of her sister was difficult for Williams.
She came back from the knee injury in the 2004 season, but other injuries plagued her for the next three years.
She won the Australian Open in 2005 and 2007, but her injuries and losses resulted in her ranking dropping to number 139.In 2008, Williams began her return to championship form by winning the U.S. Open.
The following year, she won the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and reclaimed her number one world ranking.
Her five-year gap between number one rankings is the longest of any player ever.
Williams cited her faith as a Jehovah’s Witness as well as an inspirational trip to West Africa for restoring her competitive spirit.
In 2009, she faced fines and probation after an altercation with a referee at the U.S. Open, but the following year Williams added two more Grand Slam titles and finished the season ranked number four.Williams suffered from a blood clot in her lung in 2011, but returned to dominance later that year.
In 2012, Williams earned a gold medal for singles’ tennis at the London Olympic Games.
The 2013-2015 seasons marked her third, fourth, and fifth number-one seasons, after which she had won her 21stGrand Slam championship and completed her second Serena Slam.In 2017, Williams won the Australian Open.
It was her 23rdGrand Slam title, meaning she surpassed Steffi Graf’s record for Grand Slam singles’ titles in the Open Era.
A few months later, she revealed she was expecting her first child and had been pregnant when she won the Australian Open.
That September, Williams gave birth to her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr., and married Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian shortly after.
Williams experienced a difficult childbirth: she had an emergency cesarean section and suffered from another blood clot and other severe complications.
By telling her story publicly, Williams contributed to a growing national dialogue about the disproportionately high number of Black women that suffer from pregnancy and postpartum complications.Williams returned to tennis in 2018, ranked number 549.
The attention Williams brought to the issue of rankings after giving birth led the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) to take action.
The WTA’s new rule allowed players who leave the sport for childbirth or injury to use their previous rankings to enter up to 12 tournaments within three years of their return.
Williams, whose career winnings exceed $90 million, also advocates for female tennis players regarding equitable prize money.Outside of tennis, Williams has been busy as well.
She realized her fashion design dreams when she released her clothing line (“S by Serena”) in 2018 as well as a jewelry line in 2019.
She serves as a UNICEF International Goodwill Ambassador; has opened two secondary schools in Kenya; and sits on the board of the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative.
She has her own venture capital firm, Serena Ventures, that invests in technology companies owned or led by women and African Americans.Williams was named the AP Female Athlete of the Decade for her dominance in the 2010s.
She continues to inspire tennis hopefuls and the wider public through her hard work and pursuit of excellence on and off the court.Works CitedAllen, JA.

Williams began intensive tennis training at age three.
She won her first major championship in 1999 and completed the career Grand Slam in 2003.
Along with her individual success, Serena has teamed with sisterVenus Williamsto win a series of doubles titles.
In 2017, she defeated her big sister at the Australian Open to claim the 23rd Grand Slam singles title of her career.Early Life and FamilySerena Jameka Williams was born on September 26, 1981, in Saginaw, Michigan, to Richard and Oracene Williams.
The youngest of Richard's five daughters, Serena and her sister Venus would grow up to become great tennis champions.Serena's father — a former sharecropper from Louisiana determined to see his two youngest girls succeed — used what he'd gleaned from tennis books and videos to instruct Serena and Venus on how to play the game.
At the age of three, practicing on a court not far from the family's new Compton, California, home, Serena withstood the rigors of daily two-hour practices from her father.The fact that the family had relocated to Compton was no accident.
With its high rate of gang activity, Richard wanted to expose his daughters to the ugly possibilities of life "if they did not work hard and get an education."
In this setting, on courts that were riddled with potholes and sometimes missing nets, Serena and Venus cut their teeth on the game of tennis and the requirements for persevering in a tough climate.By 1991, Serena was 46-3 on the junior United States Tennis Association tour and ranked first in the 10-and-under division.
Sensing his girls needed better instruction to become successful professionals, he moved his family again — this time to Florida.
There, Richard let go of some of his coaching responsibilities, but not the management of Serena's and Venus' career.
Wary of his daughters burning out too quickly, he scaled back their junior tournament schedule.READ MORE: Serena and Venus Williams: How Their Father Made Them Tennis StarsThe Williams SistersSerena and her older sister Venus were groomed for a tennis career from the age of three years old by their father.
With their signature style and play, Venus and Serena changed the look of their sport.
Their sheer power and athletic ability overwhelmed opponents, and their sense of style and presence made them standout celebrities on the court.
The close-knit sisters lived together for more than a dozen years in a gated Palm Beach Gardens enclave in Florida, but they went their separate ways after Serena bought a mansion in nearby Jupiter in December 2013.In 1999, Serena beat out her sister Venus in their race to the family's first Grand Slam win when she captured the U.S. Open title.
It set the stage for a run of high-powered, high-profile victories for both Williams sisters.In 2008, Serena and Venus teamed up to capture a second women's doubles Olympic gold medal at the Beijing Games.
The next year, Serena and Venus purchased shares of the Miami Dolphins to become the first African American women to own part of an NFL team.At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Serena claimed her fourth overall Olympic gold medal by teaming with sister Venus to defeat Czech Republic stars Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka in women's doubles.Seeking to add to her hardware collection in the summer of 2015, Williams had to overcome big sister Venus to advance past the fourth round at Wimbledon.
A few days later, she defeated Garbine Muguruza in the final to claim her second career "Serena Slam" and become the oldest Grand Slam singles champion in the Open era.At the 2015 U.S. Open, Williams again squared off with Venus in a tough quarterfinal matchup, this time pulling away in the deciding third set.
The outcome left her two wins shy of the calendar year Grand Slam, a feat accomplished by just three women in the sport's history.
But it was not to be.
In a shocking upset, unseeded Roberta Vinci, ranked No.
43 in the world, dashed Williams' quest by pulling out a 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 win in the semifinals.Just hours after her singles win at Wimbledon in 2016, Serena and Venus won the doubles championship, their sixth Wimbledon win together.At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, the Williams sisters experienced a shocking upset when they were bounced out of the first round of women's doubles at the Rio Olympics by Czech duo Lucie Safarova and Barbora Strycova.
The Williams sisters had originally been seeded as no.
1, had an Olympic record of 15-0, and had won gold three times previously.Williams scored a historic victory at the 2017 Australian Open, winning her 23rd Grand Slam title after defeating her sister Venus, 6-4 6-4.
With her 23rd win, she surpassed Steffi Graf's total and captured the world number one ranking.Reflecting on her victory, Williams credited her sister as an inspiration.
I would really like to take this moment to congratulate Venus, she is an amazing person," she said.
There is no way I would be at 23 without her.
There is no way I would be at one without her.
She is my inspiration, she is the only reason.
I am standing here today and the only reason that the Williams sisters exist.
The Serena Slam’In 1995 Serena turned pro.
Two years later, she was already No.
99 in the world rankings — up from No.
304 just 12 months before.
A year later, she graduated high school and almost immediately inked a $12 million shoe deal with Puma.In 2002, Serena won the French Open, the U.S. Open, and Wimbledon, defeating sister Venus in the finals of each tournament.
She captured her first Australian Open in 2003, making her one of only six women in the Open era to complete a career Grand Slam.
The win also fulfilled her desire to hold all four major titles simultaneously to comprise what she'd dubbed "The Serena Slam.
Burnout & ComebackIn August 2003, Serena underwent knee surgery, and in September her half-sister Yetunde Price was murdered in Los Angeles, California.
Three years later, Serena seemed burned out.
Plagued by injuries, and just a general lack of motivation to stay fit or compete at the same level she once had, Serena saw her tennis ranking slump to 139.Serena credited her faith as a Jehovah's Witness, as well as a life-changing journey she made to West Africa, for renewing her pride and competitive fire.
In 2008, she won the U.S. Open.
By 2009, Williams reclaimed her place atop the world's rankings, winning both the 2009 Australian Open singles (for the fourth time) and Wimbledon 2009 singles (for the third time).
She also won the doubles matches at both the Australian Open and Wimbledon that year.ProbationWilliams made headlines in September 2009, when she blasted a lineswoman for a foot-fault called near the end of a semifinal loss to eventual champion Kim Clijsters at the U.S. Open.
The profanity-laced outburst included finger pointing and, according to the lineswoman, an alleged threat from Serena against her life.Williams downplayed what happened, refuting the allegation that she'd threatened the woman.
But the incident did not go over well with the tennis-viewing public, nor the U.S. Tennis Association, which fined her $10,000 on the spot.
Two months later, she was placed on two-year probation and ordered to pay another $82,500 to the Grand Slam committee for the episode, the largest punishment ever levied against a tennis player.By early 2010, Senena was back on track, winning the Australian Open singles and doubles matches as well as her fourth Wimbledon singles championship.Injuries and Retirement SpeculationIn 2011, Serena suffered a series of health scares after doctors found a blood clot in one of her lungs, which kept her away from tennis for several months.
Following several procedures, including one to remove a hematoma, speculation rose as to whether Williams would retire from the sport.Serena’s health improved by September 2011, however, and she looked like her old dominant self at the U.S. Open before falling to Samantha Stosur in the finals.Williams stumbled badly at the 2012 French Open, enduring a first-round loss for the first time at a major tournament.
But she was back in top form in London in July 2012, defeating 23-year-old Agnieszka Radwanska in an emotional three sets to claim her fifth Wimbledon singles title and first major championship in two years.At the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, Serena beatMaria Sharapovato take her first gold medal in women's singles.15th and 16th Grand Slam TitlesSerena continued her winning streak to her next Grand Slam event.
In September 2012, she beat out rival Victoria Azarenka to take the singles title at the U.S. Open.
According toUSA Today, Williams wasn't sure that she'd emerge victorious.
I honestly can't believe I won.
I was really preparing my runner-up speech, because I thought, 'Man, she's playing so great.
By this time, Serena had captured 15 Grand Slam singles titles and 13 Grand Slam doubles titles.
I would like to leave a mark," Serena once said about her standing in the tennis world.
I think obviously I will, due to the fact that I'm doing something different in tennis.
But I don't think I could ever reach something like aMartina Navratilova— I don't think I'd ever play that long — but who knows?
I think I'll leave a mark regardless.
In June 2013, Serena took her second French Open title — as well as her 16th Grand Slam singles title — in a 6-4, 6-4 victory over defending champion Sharapova.
I'm still a little bit upset about that loss last year," Serena said in an interview with ESPN following the match.
But it's all about, for me, how you recover.
I think I've always said a champion isn't about how much they win, but it's about how they recover from their downs, whether it's an injury or whether it's a loss.
2013 Wimbledon Loss and U.S. Open WinNearly one month later, Serena competed at Wimbledon, where she suffered a shocking loss (6-2, 1-6, 6-4) in the fourth round to Germany's Sabine Lisicki, the No.
23 seed.Her career-best 34-match winning streak over, Serena toldSports Illustrated, "I don't think it's a huge shock.
Lisicki] is a great player.
Her ranking has no effect on what she should be.
She should be ranked higher.
She just has a super, super game to play well on grass.
At the 2013 U.S. Open, Serena made a strong showing.
She knocked out her younger rival Sloane Stephens in the fourth round before upending Azarenka to clinch the U.S. Open title.
It was the second year in a row that the pair had faced off in the finals.20th Grand SlamSerena clinched her third straight and sixth overall U.S. Open singles title in 2014 by defeating her good friend Caroline Wozniacki.
Her winning ways carried into the new year, as she beat Sharapova to claim the 2015 Australian Open championship.
At the French Open in June, Serena managed to overcome illness to win the tournament for the third time and claim her 20th Grand Slam singles title, good for third place all-time.
When I was a little girl, in California, my father and my mother wanted me to play tennis," she told the crowd in French after her victory.
And now I'm here, with 20 Grand Slam titles.
2016 Losses and WinsSerena opened 2016 by advancing to the Australian Open final, where she lost in three sets to Angelique Kerber.
After notching career WTA title No.
70 with a win at the Italian Open, she advanced to a French Open final rematch with Muguruza, but this time succumbed to the Spanish player in straight sets.On July 9, 2016, Serena found her way back to victory, defeating Kerber 7-5, 6-3 at Wimbledon and winning her 22nd grand slam title.
With her historic win, Serena tied Steffi Graf for the most major championships in the Open era of professional tennis, which started in 1968.
I have definitely had some sleepless nights with a lot of stuff, coming so close and feeling it and not being able to get there," Serena told reporters.
This tournament I came in with a different mindset.
In Melbourne I thought I played well but Angelique played great, and better.
So I knew going into this one I needed to be calm and be confident and play the tennis I've been playing for well over a decade.
At the 2016 U.S. Open, Serena suffered another surprising defeat, leaving the competition early after she was defeated by Karolina Pliskova in their semifinal match.
With the loss, she also gave up the No.
1 ranking which she'd held for 186 weeks.23rd Grand Slam, Pregnancy and BirthSerena went on to clinch the 2017 Australian Open to win her 23rd Grand Slam title.
Later that year, she revealed she was two months pregnant during the game.
She gave birth to her daughter in September and returned to the courts in late December 2017, hoping to shake off the rust in time to defend her Australian Open title.However, Williams withdrew from the opening Grand Slam tournament in early 2018, noting she wasn't quite ready yet after the birth of her daughter in September.
I can compete—but I don't want to just compete, I want to do far better than that and to do so, I will need a little more time," she said.Serena finally returned to competition on February 11, teaming up with Venus for a doubles match in Fed Cup play.
Clad in her "Wakanda-inspired catsuit," Williams looked to be rounding into form at the French Open, before pulling out with a pectoral injury prior to her eagerly anticipated fourth-round match against Sharapova.
Recovering from the setback, she proceeded to march through the Wimbledon women's draw in July, her run ending with a loss to Kerber in the final.At the end of the month, just before a match against Johanna Konta at the Mubadala Silicon Valley Classic, Serena learned that the man who murdered her half-sister had been paroled three years short of his full sentence.
She subsequently suffered a lopsided defeat, and later toldTimehow heavily the news weighed on her during the match.The star athlete was back in the news in late August when French Tennis Federation President Bernard Giudicelli said he was instituting a new dress code at the French Open to prevent the reappearance of the notorious catsuit.
After insisting she had no problem with the ruling, Williams went on to wear a custom-designed tutu for the start of U.S. Open play, in which she easily dispatched her early competition en route to a third-round matchup with big sister Venus.2018 U.S. Open and 2019 Runner-up FinishesJust one year after giving birth, Serena was back in top form at the 2018 U.S. Open.
During the final match against Japan's Naomi Osaka, Williams got in a heated dispute with the umpire after he determined that her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, was giving her hand signals from the stands, so the umpire gave her a coaching violation.Serena denied any cheating and accused him of sexism and attacking her character.
You owe me an apology!"
she said.
She then got a point penalty for smashing her racket and a penalty for verbal abuse.
Osaka won the match, 6-2, 6-4, and Williams was later fined $17,000 for the incident.At the 2019 Australian Open, the site of her last Grand Slam crown, Serena played her way into a quarterfinal match against Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic.
However, she lost despite being up 5-1 in the third set, a stunning collapse for a champion known for her nerves of steel.A few months later, Serena was outplayed in a third-round French Open loss to 20-year-old American Sofia Kenen.
She got back on track and advanced to the Wimbledon final, before suffering a straight-set loss to Romania's Simona Halep.
Serena then breezed through her draw at the 2019 U.S. Open but was unable to overcome 19-year-old Canadian Bianca Andreescu in the final.Although she finished the year without a Grand Slam win, Williams earned a consolation prize by being named the AP Female Athlete of the Decade.2020 U.S. Open and 2021 Australian OpenTaking a medical time out after a third-set point during the semifinals on September 10, 2020, Williams called over her trainer while clutching her left ankle.

The tennis great posted a photo with her baby on Instagram and shared the journey of her pregnancy in a video posted on her website and on YouTube.In the cover story for the February 2018 edition ofVogue, Williams revealed the major health complications that came with giving birth to Alexis Olympia.
After undergoing an emergency cesarean section, Williams experienced sudden shortness of breath, leading to the discovery of blood clots in her lungs.
Additionally, doctors found a large hematoma in her abdomen that had been caused by hemorrhaging at the site of her C-section.Following multiple surgeries, Williams was able to return home after a week.
However, she was then unable to get out of bed for another six weeks, leaving her feeling helpless at times when it came to tending to her newborn.
Despite the toll it took on her emotions, she toldVogueshe was willing to consider having more children, but understandably was in no rush to do so.TV, Books & FashionProving to have much more than just tennis clout, Serena expanded her brand into film, television, and fashion.

With her older sister Venus, she formed half of a tennis-prodigy pair that had been making headlines from an early age.
As an African American in a historically white- and European-dominated sport, she found herself in the spotlight and under scrutiny.
Serena andVenus Williamswere coached by their father Richard, an unorthodox career-builder whose methods stirred comment and controversy.
Beyond all these reasons Serena Williams caught the attention of tennis fans simply because she was a player of extraordinary ability and dynamism.
She has risen to the very top of her game winning five Grand Slam events in two years and being ranked in the top five female tennis players in the world for over three years.Serena Williams was born in Saginaw,Michigan, on September 26, 1981, but she and her sister were raised in the economically depressed and often violence-riddledLos Angelessuburb of Compton.
Her father, Richard Williams, ran a private security firm, and her mother, Oracene (who often uses the name Brandy), was a nurse.
A fan of televised tennis, Richard Williams dreamed of the opportunities that might await his offspring-to-be:“I went to my wife and said,‘Let’s have kids and make them tennis players,’”he toldNewsweek.
Venus, born in 1980, and Serena, the youngest daughter, showed promise from the start.“Venus and Serena took to tennis as soon as rackets were put in their hands,”older sister Lyndrea toldSportmagazine.Early Career Marked By Father’s DirectionThe sisters’early training took place on public tennis courts in and around Compton, where they remember having to duck gunfire.
Despite this difficult beginning, though, their skills developed rapidly.
Serena entered her first tournament at the age of four and a half, and over the next five years, her father has claimed, she won 46 of 49 tournaments she entered.
She succeeded Venus as the number-one player in southernCalifornia’s highly competitive age-12-and-under rankings, and well before reaching adolescence both sisters had attracted national attention in the form of invitations to prestigious tennis camps, promises of lucrative product-endorsement deals, and glowing newspaper reportage.In 1991 Richard Williams, who managed and coached both Serena and Venus, made the first of several unorthodox moves in regard to his daughters’career: he decided that they should enter no more tournaments on the national junior circuit.
Junior tournaments are the usual path to stardom for young tennis players, so Serena’s development as a player took place to some degree in isolation from her peers.
Richard Williams has said that he hoped to avoid subjecting his daughters to competitive pressures, including an undertone of racial hostility.
Serena and Venus were sent to theFloridatennis academy of teaching pro Ric Macci, who had also worked with teenage standoutsJennifer Capriatiand Mary Pierce, and thanks to Richard’s canny handling of a clothing endorsement deal, the familyAt a Glance…Born on September 26, 1981,inSaginaw, MI; daughter of Richard (a security agency owner and tennis coach) and Oracene (Brandy) Williams (a nurse).Education;Attending Art Institute of Florida,Religion:Jehovah’s Witness.Career:Professional tennis player, 1995-; actress, 2002-.Memberships:Women’s Tennis Association.Selected awards:Won six Grand Slam tournaments including 1999 and 2002 U.S. Open, 2002 French Open, 2002 and 2003 Wimbledon, and the 2003 Australian Open; won six Grand Slam doubles tournaments including 1999 U.S. Open, 1999 French Open, 2000 and 2002 Wimbledon, and the 2001 and 2003 Australian Open; won WTA Championship, 2001 ; won Olympic gold medal for doubles tennis, 2000; WTA number one ranked player in the world, July 8, 2002-August 10, 2003;Associated PressFemale Athlete of the Year, 2003; ESPY for female tennis player of the year and female athlete of the year, 2003; Sportswoman of the Year, Laureus World Sports Academy.Addresses:Office—c/o USTA, 70 W Red Oak Ln, White Plains, NY, 10604–3602.was able to move to a rambling estate in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.
In 1993 both girls left school and continued their education at home.After raising eyebrows by pulling his daughters out of the junior circuit, Richard Williams once again stirred talk in the tennis world by allowing them to turn professional at the age of 14.
Still banned from World Tennis Association (WTA) events at that age, Williams made her professional debut in October of 1995 at the non-WTA Bell Challenge in Vanier,Quebec,Canada, losing in less than an hour to a virtual unknown.
But her father, who has defenders as well as critics on the tennis circuit, offered constant encouragement, and the play of both sisters improved dramatically.“Nobody knows those girls better than their parents—the road they’ve gone on couldn’t have been better selected,”legendary coach Nick Bollettieri toldNewsweek.
Williams took 1996 off, playing in neither WTA nor non-WTA events.
Her father felt that she needed more training to develop and he was also working on Venus’s professional career as well.Quickly Rose in WTA RanksWilliams’first professional match in the WTA was inMoscowin 1997 where she was taken out in the first round by a highly ranked player.
Many critics claimed that she did not have the talent of her older sister, who was slowly climbing the ranks of the WTA, but that perception was soon to change.
Williams qualified for an Ameritech-sponsored tournament inChicagowhere she was slated to face Mary Pierce, who was ranked number seven in the world, in the second round.
She staged a stunning upset over Pierce, beating her in only two sets.
This advanced her to the quarter finals where she faced an even more difficult opponent, fourth-rankedMonica Seles.
At first it seemed that Williams had given her all in the match against Pierce as she dropped the first set to Seles.
Then, in a shocking turn of events, Williams rallied and won the next two sets, defeating Seles.
The critics who had said that she showed little promise only a few weeks before now spoke of her as the next rising WTA star, which was reflected in her ranking, which jumped from 304 to 102 after the tournament.
She would finish 1997, her first full season with the WTA, with a ranking of 99.By the following year her world ranking had risen as high as number 21, and both Williams and her sister, Venus, were bona-fide celebrities.
She served notice that her time had come when she advanced to the semifinals of aSydney,Australiatournament by beating the then third-ranked woman in the world, Lindsay Davenport, who went on to become theUnited StatesOpen champion that year.
Expected to do well in her first“Grand Slam”tournament, the Australian Open, she had the bad luck of having to face her sister in the second round after ousting ninth-ranked Irina Spirlea in the first round.Venus emerged victorious, andEssencemagazine reported that she was heard to say,“I’m sorry I had to take you out, Serena,”as the two sisters walked off the court.
This was the first time that the public caught a glimpse of the relationship between the two sisters and how they work not only to be the best for themselves, but also to motivate each other.“They haven’t admitted to it, but there’s definitely a competitiveness between Serena and Venus,”former U.S. Open finalist Pam Shriver toldSport.“They motivate each other and feed off each other’s successes.
Venus’jump to a No.
10 ranking has definitely inspired Serena to improve her ranking,”she continued.
The sisters met again that year in the Italian Open this time in the quarter finals where once again Venus took the victory.1998 continued to be an excellent year for Williams as she continued to succeed beyond expectations.
She began to play in doubles play and won two other doubles titles that year with Venus inOklahoma Cityand Zurich.
Her victory inOklahoma Citybecame Williams’first pro title in doubles, but it would not be her last.
She also went on to win two mixed double
titles at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open with partner Max Mirnyi.1999 was a watershed year for Williams as it would be the one in which she won her first singles title as well as a Grand Slam tournament.
Ranked number 21 at the beginning of the season, her first single title came at theParisIndoor tournament where she defeated Amelie Mauresmo in three sets.
From there she went on to win Indian Wells where she plowed through Lindsey Davenport, Mary Pierce, and number seven rankedSteffi Grafto gain her victory.
Williams was on a 16-match win streak when she met up with Venus again in the finals of a tournament inMiami, defeating Seles, Coetzer and number one ranked Martina Hingis in straight sets.
While she did lose to her sister again, Williams did crack the top ten of the rankings for the first time, becoming the ninth best player in the world.Williams’biggest match of the year, however, came when she entered the U.S. Open.
Her road to the finals took her through fourth-ranked Seles and second-ranked Davenport, and once she had defeated them, she had to face number one ranked Hingis.
But when the final match was over, Williams had won her first Grand Slam tournament in record setting fashion.
She became the lowest seeded player to ever win the title as well as the second African-American woman to win a Grand Slam title.
The only thing Williams had not done yet was to beat her sister Venus, and that happened later that year where the sisters met in the finals of the Grand Slam Cup.
It seemed that nothing could stop Williams and that she was poised to take over the world of women’s tennis.Plagued by Medical ProblemsWilliams was forced to slow down at the end of 1999 when she began to have health issues that took her out of numerous matches.
She withdrew from a tournament in Hilton Head with patella tendonitis in her right knee and also left the quarter finals at the German Open with a strained right elbow.
Perhaps the most crushing moments for Williams came when she was forced to withdrew from Wimbledon with severe influenza and from the season-ending championship (which she had qualified to play in that year for the first time) with a back injury sustained in practice.
Regardless of her inability to compete, Williams still ended the season ranked number four and was prepared to rise even higher in 2000.2000, however, would be another season that was impacted by injury and health problems.
While she was able to defend herLos Angelestitle by defeating Hingis and Davenport and also won a title at Hannover, she suffered from a right knee ligament injury that many suspect lead to her defeat at the Paris Indoor tournament.
She entered the Canadian Open and was dominating in a match against Hingis, but was forced to retire when one of the small bones in the base of her left foot became inflamed.
This would be her most serious injury all season and would result in her withdrawing from the U.S. Open doubles competition during the semi-finals round and completely from the championship.
The final blow came in April when she left the second round of the Amelia Island tournament with a meniscus tear in her left foot.
Williams finally decided to take some time off and heal, hoping to rebound later in the year.By June of 2000 Williams was healthier than she had been the entire season and she qualified for Wimbledon.
She quickly showed that she was back on track by advancing to the semi-finals round losing only 13 games in five matches, the least amount of games lost since Chris Evert in 1976.
In the semi-finals round however, Williams once again had to face her sister Venus.
TheStar-Ledgercalled the match“the event of year in tennis and watershed event for a sport that has spent more than a decade in the doldrums.”The match ended up being a let down to many—Venus won in two sets 6–2, 7–6—but it proved to Serena that while she had won a Grand Slam title in the past, she still had room to improve on her game.
As she told theKnight Ridder/Tribune News Service,“I expected to play a lot better than I did today.
It was my goal to do better in this tournament.”Even though Williams felt that she was not at the top of her game, she did leave the 2000 season with two very distinct wins, one for doubles at Wimbledon and a gold medal for doubles at the Summer Olympics in Australia, both with her sister Venus as her partner.Became Best Player in the WorldThe 2001 season started out slow for Williams when she lost twice to Hingis, once in Sydney and once at the Australian Open.
She did, however, find victory again in the doubles tournament of the Australian Open with her sister Venus.
As doubles partners, the Williams sisters seemed undefeatable.
Peter Tatum, an executive at the IMG sports marketing firm told theStar-Ledger,“They play a different type of game, come from a different place, and have a different attitude than virtually anything the game of tennis has ever seen.”While Venus would continue to succeed early in the season, Williams seemed to continue down a familiar path she had traveled in 1999 and 2000 when she withdrew from the Paris Indoor tournament with fatigue and from the Scottsdale tournament with the flu.
While she did win a title at Indian Wells over Kim Clijster, she fell to Capriati in the quarter-finals round in the Miami tournament and withdrew from the Charleston tournament, the Italian Open, and the Madrid tournament because of knee injuries.Williams bounced back to win the Canadian Open over third-ranked Capriati who had knocked her out of Wimbledon that year in the second quarter-finals round.
Then Williams dominated the U.S. Open defeating Davenport and Hingis on her way to the finals where she once again was matched up against her
sister Venus.
It was the first time that the sisters had ever met in a Grand Slam final and while the match-up proved to be much more exciting than their semi-final round in Wimbledon the previous year, Williams still walked away defeated by her older sister.
While Williams took the loss hard, she used it as a stepping stone to improve even more and by the end of the season, she was in peak form and for the first time was healthy enough to compete in the WTA Championship.
She advanced to the finals where she faced Davenport, but the match was never played for Davenport withdrew with a knee injury.
While Williams has said she would have rather played the match to prove that she was the best player that year, she still walked away with a major win, her first since her U.S. Open win in 1999.Finally, in 2002, Williams hit her stride and began to rack up the victories.
She started off slow with an ankle injury in the Australian Open, but went on to win a major tournament in Miami, where she beat the three top players in the world, Hingis, her sister Venus, and Capriati, on her way to the title.
From there, she only continued to succeed.
She took the Italian Open victory from Capriati and then captured the French Open title, beating out Venus for the first time in a Grand Slam competition and rising to number two in the world rankings, bested only by her number one ranked sister Venus.
The sisters got a chance at a rematch later that year when they met in the finals of Wimbledon, where once again, Williams defeated Venus to take the title.
To Williams, this was the most important win of her career to date, because, as she told theSunday Mercury,“it has so much prestige and so much history.”As in past years, Williams also competed with sister Venus in the doubles competition at Wimbledon and came away with another title, their fifth Grand Slam victory as a team.After Wimbledon, Williams quickly snatched the number one ranking away from Venus and for the next year held on to it with amazing play on the courts.
She once again defeated Venus, this time in the U.S. Open, her third straight Grand Slam for that year.
She also won numerous other tournaments both in single and double play including the Princess Cup inTokyoand theLeipzigtournament, but ended up losing the WTA Championship to Kim Clijster in two sets.
The following season she started off strong by winning her fourth straight Grand Slam event, once again beating Venus in the finals at the Australian Open and became just one of five women to have ever held all four Grand Slam titles at one time.
The Williams sisters took the doubles title as well at the Australian Open, their sixth straight.
Williams went on to win the Paris Indoor tournament and Miami tournament before losing in the Charleston tournament finals to Justine Henin-Hardenne, ending a 21-match winning streak.Sought Other AvenuesWhile Williams reigned supreme in 2002 and early 2003, the early summer of 2003 was a rollercoaster of failure and success.
The first major setback came at the French Open when Williams rematched with Henin-Hardenne in the semi-final round.
She made 75 unforced errors and lost the match in three sets, but even worse for Williams was the Parisian crowd reaction which included heckling Williams when she challenged calls, or starting chants in favor of Henin-Hardenne, a European favorite.
The heckling got so bad that it drove Serena to tears by the end of the match.
As she told theKnight Ridder/Tribune News Service,“I think it’s bad when people start booing in between serves.
Or other people egging them on by doing ridiculous things.
That gets a little tough, too, you know.”Many people wondered if the French Open was the beginning of a downturn in Williams’play, but they were soon proved wrong a month later when Williams stormed back to win her second straight Wimbledon against sister Venus.
Unfortunately, Williams reinjured her knee during doubles play in Wimbledon and withdrew from theLos Angelestournament, the Canadian Open, and the U.S. Open.
She hopes to still compete in the WTA Championship later in the year if she has properly recouped from the injury.Because of her massive amount of success in tennis at such a young age as well as her recent health problems on the court, Williams has been looking in other areas to diversify herself.
As she told theLos Angeles Times,“I’ve never considered tennis as my only outlet.
I’ve always liked doing different things when I was younger.
I just never really liked focusing on tennis.
I do see myself as a crossover.”Included in Williams’ventures outside of tennis is studying for a degree at the Art Institute of Florida, designing outfits with her sponsor Puma, and doing guest spots on television shows.
In late 2002 she appeared on an episode of ABC’sMy Wife and Kidsand she is scheduled to appear in October of 2003 in an episode of the Showtime seriesStreet Time.
She has also been offered roles in feature films inHollywood, but has yet to make the leap to the big screen.
Williams told theStar-Ledgerthat she is still waiting for the right part:“I believe I’m a good actress and I have a lot of skill I would like to do something that challenges my acting skills and get people to see the skills I do have.”Williams was filming her role onStreet Timewhen she learned of the death of her half-sister, Yetunde Price, in September of 2003.
Yetunde and a companion had been driving on a street in Compton, California, when she was shot.
Police investigation turned up one suspect, and they were looking for more.
Reports indicated Price was caught in the crossfire of two gangs.
Price was a divorced mother of three children, whom Williams and her sister, Venus, have vowed to help raise.
Yetunde was also a registered nurse and personal assistant to the two tennis stars.
She also co-owned a beauty salon.Whether she continues to dominate in the world of tennis or heads in a different direction, most critics and
supporters alike agree that Serena Williams will succeed.
As Janice Spector, Avon’s vice president for advertising, told theKnight Ridder/Tribune News Serviceabout Avon spokesperson Williams,“She goes beyond tennis but what really interests us is she is a wonderful contemporary role model for young women.
She’s achieved something wonderful.
She’s smart and she’s her own person.
I think her recent successes have only enhanced her confidence.”SourcesPeriodicalsArizona Republic, September 5, 1998, C2.Courier-Mail(Brisbane, Australia), July 18, 2003, p. 8.Daily Telegraph(London,England), May 27, 2002, p. 14.Essence, August 1998, p. 78.Jet, September 21, 1998, p. 49.Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, July 7, 2000; June 8, 2002; June 5, 2003; June 23, 2003; July 20, 2003.Los Angeles Times, October 30, 2002, p.

For Serena, 2002 was particularly sweet.
The year didn't get off to a particularly auspicious start.
A sprained ankle forced Williams to miss the Australian Open in January 2002, but things brightened up considerably for the remainder of the year.
She won seven of her next 12 events, winning three of the four 2002 Grand Slam tournaments—the French Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open—and snatching from sister Venus the number one world women's ranking.
In recognition of her impressive performance in 2002, Williams, along with Australian Lleyton Hewitt, was named International Tennis Federation world champion in December.
As 2003 dawned, Williams became only the fifth woman in tennis history to hold all four Grand Slam titles, beating Venus in the finals of the Australian Open.
Of Williams' brilliance on the tennis court, tennis greatChris Evert, toldPeople: "Serena really is too good.
I'd like to see some players get close to athleticism, and I don't see it yet on the horizon.
Born in Saginaw,MichiganWilliams was born in Saginaw, Michigan, on September 26, 1981, 15 months after older sister Venus.
The youngest of the five daughters of Richard and Oracene (nicknamed Brandi) Williams grew up in the grittyLos Angelessuburb of Compton, where her father ran a private security firm.
Richard Williams, long a fan of televised tennis competition, resolved that he would teach all of his daughters to play the game.
The three oldest Williams girls showed only minimal interest in and little aptitude for tennis, but both Serena and Venus showed promised from the very start.
Of her younger sisters' enthusiasm for the game, older sister Lyndrea toldSportmagazine: "Venus and Serena took to tennis as soon as rackets were put in their hands."
Their father taught his daughters on the public tennis courts of Compton.
Both girls' skills developed rapidly, and by the age of four-and-a-half Serena entered her first tournament.
Over the next five years, according to her father, she won 46 of the 49 tournaments she entered and succeeded Venus as the number one player in Southern California's competitive age-12-and-under rankings.
It was not long before both girls began winning national attention in the form of favorable coverage in both broadcast and print media, invitations to prestigious tennis camps, and offers of lucrative product endorsement deals.In 1991 Richard Williams, who has served as both coach and manager to his youngest daughters from the start, pulled Serena and Venus out of the junior tournament circuit, preferring to shelter them from the competitive pressures of the tour.
Instead he opted to send his girls to teaching pro Ric Macci's tennis academy in Delray Beach,Florida.
From 1991 until 1995 the Williams girls studied with Macci, who had also worked withJennifer CapriatiandMary Pierce.
While studying tennis with Macci, the sisters were home-schooled by family members.
After a few years, they were enrolled at Driftwood Academy, a private, 30-student high school in Lake Park, Florida.
In 1993 the Williams family moved from Compton to a new home in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.
Serena graduated from Driftwood in August 1999 with a B-plus average.Father Takes Charge of CareerAfter the Williams sisters left Macci's tennis academy in 1995, their father, with the help of his wife, once again took over the responsibility of coaching the girls.
Even more importantly, he devoted a great deal of his time and energy to promoting his daughters, publishing a newsletter about the girls' background and training.
He also used the newsletter to blow his own horn, claiming that he had come to be known as "'King Richard'…Master and Lord of the ghettos in Compton, CA."
Of Williams' blatant self-promotion, Julia Reed wrote inVoguethat he "has a reputation for being a bit pompous and not just a little bit irritating.
But he is also wickedly funny.
Serena turned professional in October 1995, making her debut at the Bell Challenge in Vanier,Quebec, an event not sanctioned by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA).
She lost quickly to her opponent, a virtual unknown.
For the next few years, she lived in the shadow of Venus, who shot up into the top 10 in women's tennis, while Serena as of the end of 1996 had been unable to break into the top 500.
In 1997, however, things began to look up for the youngest Williams, who began the year ranked at number 453 and before long rose to number 307.
Later in the year she jumped to number 100 among women players in the space of a single week.
At the Ameritech Cup tournament inChicagolate in 1997, she upset number fourMonica Selesand number seven Mary Pierce before losing to third-rankedLindsay Davenport.
Williams' wins over Seles and Pierce made her the lowest ranked player ever to defeat two top-ten players in a single tournament.
An injury forced Serena to pull out of the doubles competition with sister Venus.Enters First Grand Slam TourneyAt the age of 16, in January of 1998, Williams entered her first Grand Slam tournament—the Australian Open—after winning a qualifying match.
Facing off against second-seeded Davenport, who had defeated her at the Ameritech Cup in late 1997, she turned the tables, handily winning the match.
Venus shocked top-rankedMartina Hingis.
When the two sisters met on the court in the second round of the finals, Venus carried the day, taking the match 7-6, 6-1.
Just to show there were no hard feelings, a smiling Serena and Venus posed for photographers after the match.Chronology1981Born in Saginaw, Michigan, on September 261991-95Studies tennis at Ric Macci's academy in Delray Beach, Florida1995Makes professional debut at Bell Challenge in Vanier, Quebec,Canada1998Enters Australian Open, her first Grand Slam tournament1999Graduates from Driftwood Academy of Lake Park, Florida, in AugustRelated Biography: Father/Coach Richard WilliamsThe biggest booster of Serena andVenus Williamsis their father, who has also served as their coach and manager from the very beginning of their tennis careers.
In fact, it's doubtful either Williams sister would be playing tennis at all were it not for Richard Williams' fervent belief that he could raise his daughters to be champions on the court.
Working with the three older sisters of Venus and Serena, Williams had had little success, but his two youngest girls took to the game from the start.Despite his undeniable success in coaxing and coaching Venus and Serena to positions of dominance in the sport, Williams continues to come under fire for some of his unorthodox techniques but mostly for what he has to say about his perceptions of racism and the stuffiness of the people who run the game.
He also shows no lack of confidence in his ability to guide his daughters to tennis stardom.
He admitted however, to Kevin Chappell ofEbonythat sometimes the criticism hurts.
When people criticize you, I don't care how much you say it doesn't bother you, it does.
It bothers you when people criticize you, especially when you're doing the best that you can do.
Because once you are doing the best you can do, you realize there is nothing else you can do.
They are criticizing you, and you can't fight back, you can't make a noise.
It's almost like someone has beaten you dead.
It's somewhat disturbing.
When Serena, his younger daughter with former wife Oracene, was still quite young, Williams moved his family from Saginaw, Michigan, to the dicey neighborhoods of Compton,California, a suburb ofLos Angeles.
He taught his girls the game on the public tennis courts of Compton, an area so riddled with gang violence that the girls had to be schooled in how to dodge errant bullets.
In 1991, he sent Serena and Venus off to Florida to train at the tennis academy of Ric Macci in Delray Beach.
Both girls turned professional by the age of 14 and have been guided by their father through every step of their careers.After losing her match with Venus at the Australian Open in January 1998, Serena trailed her sister in the rankings, but she was the first of the two to win a Grand Slam title.
Still only 16 years old, she teamed with Max Mirnyi ofBelarusto win the mixed doubles tournament at Wimbledon in July of 1998.
Although the spotlight was still trained on Venus, more and more observers of the game began to predict that Serena, with her power, eventually would overshadow her older sister.
By August of 1998, Serena's ranking had improved to number 21.
Whatever the fans or critics were saying, nothing seemed to have any effect on the close relationship between the sisters.
That relationship—seemingly strengthened by their occasional face-to-face meetings on the court—captured the interest of the media, which ran numerous features about the sisters.
Away from tennis, the two loved to gossip about boys and shop, the latter pastime easilyfinanced by the sisters' lucrative product endorsement deals.
In 1998 Serena signed a $12 million deal with Puma, helping her to keep pace with Venus, who had an equally impressive deal with Reebok.Beats Mauresmo to Win First WTA TitleWilliams won the first WTA title of her career early in 1999, overpowering Amelie Mauresmo ofFrance6-2, 3-6, 7-6 in the OpenGaz de Francetournament inParis.
In besting Mauresmo, Serena became the first American ever to win that tournament.
Making the victory even sweeter for the Williams family was an almost simultaneous win by Venus in the IGA Super Thrift Tennis Classic inOklahoma City.
Serena followed her Open Gaz victory with a win overSteffi Grafat the Evert Cup tournament in Indian Wells, California, the very next week, grabbing her second WTA title in a row.
During a three-week period ending with her defeat of Graf in California, Serena won 11 consecutive matches.
In an interview with Michael Silver ofSports Illustrated,Williams made it clear who she saw as her main competitor.
Whatever my potential is, I want to reach it now," she told Silver.
And if I do, I see Venus as my biggest competition.
The head-to-head sibling rivalry of which Serena spoke was not long in coming.
On March 28, 1999, Venus beat her younger sister 6-1, 4-6, 6-4 at the Lipton Championships in Key Biscayne, Florida.
The Williams faceoff marked the first time in more than a century that two sisters met each other in a tennis tournament finals match.
The previous match between sisters had come in 1884 when 19-year-old Maud Watson beat older sister Lillian, 26, at the first women's Wimbledon.
Serena's loss to Venus at Key Biscayne was not really the first time she'd fallen to her older sister but actually her third consecutive loss to Venus, the others coming at the Australian Open and Italian Open in 1998.
Despite these defeats, Serena was moving up impressively in the world tennis rankings, finding herself at number 10 by mid-April 1999.Wins First Singles TitleLater in 1999 the Williams sisters teamed up to win the doubles title at the French Open.
The sweetest victory came for seventh-ranked Serena at the U.S. Open in 1999 when she became the lowest seed to win the women's title since 1968.
In taking her first Grand Slam singles title, Williams became only the second African-American woman to do so.
The win boosted Serena's world ranking to number four, the highest ranking of her career.
Although she'd started out way back in the rankings, Serena now found herself running neck and neck with Venus.
On the heels of Serena's singles victory at the U.S. Open, the sisters teamed up again to win the doubles title at the U.S. Open, making them the first African American team to do so in the history of the tournament.In July 2000, Venus defeated Serena in the semi-finals at Wimbledon.
Crushed by the loss to her older sister, Williams left the court in tears, as Venus attempted to comfort her.
Serena bounced back to join her older sister to take the women's doubles title at Wimbledon, marking the first time the event had been won by a sister team.
In 2000 singles competition, Serena took her first singles title of the year by defeating Denisa Chladkova ofCzechoslovakiaat the Faber Grand Prix.
Perhaps the high point of the year for both Serena and Venus came at the 2000 Summer Olympics inSydney.
Team Williams defeated the Dutch team of Miriam Oremans and Kristie Boogert, 6-1, 6-1, to take the gold medal in women's doubles.Williams won her first singles title of 2001 at Indian Wells, California, with a victory over Kim Clijsters, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.
At the Australian Open that year, she advanced to the quarter-finals, where she fell to Martina Hingis, who later defeated Venus as well.
In doubles competition, the Williams sisters once again triumphed.
Later that year Serena was stopped byJennifer Capriatiin the quarter-finals of both the French Open and Wimbledon.
At the U.S. Open, Serena and Venus faced off against each other in the women's finals, where Venus carried the day, winning the match 6-2, 6-4.What was to be the brightest season yet of Serena's tennis career started off on a decidedly unpromising note.
Williams was forced to sit out the Australian Open in January 2002 because of a sprained ankle.
But the injury was not to keep her down for long.
Serena won seven of her next 12 events, replacing Venus as the number one-ranked woman in tennis.
In an interview withPeople,she said: "I'm physically strong but mentally stronger.
I think if you have the attitude that you can do anything, you really can."
Williams proved conclusively that she had the right attitude by taking three of the big four Grand Slam titles—the French Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open—in 2002.
The following year got off to a promising start, as a healthy Serena nailed the last of the four Grand Slam tournamments for the season, beating sister Venus in the finals of the Australian Open.Still in her very early 20s, Serena Williams has made an indelible impression on the world of tennis, quickly moving up through the ranks of the game to draw even with older sister Venus and then to moving into the number one ranking.
Only time will tell what lies ahead for Williams, but of one thing she is certain: "Family comes first, no matter how many times we play each other," she toldSports Illustrated.
Nothing will come between me and my sister.

With her outgoing personality, unique fashion sense, and striking good looks, Williams would have commanded attention even if she hadn't been a topranked professional player.
But her skills on the court happen to be extraordinary, the result of years of training, natural ability, and a powerful determination to win.
Williams has gained additional attention as an African American athlete in a sport generally dominated by white players.
Her 1999 singles victory at the U.S. Open made her only the second black woman ever to win a Grand Slam title;Althea Gibson(1927–2003) was the first.
The Grand Slam tournaments—the Australian Open, Roland Garros (better known as the French Open), Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open—are among the game's most visible and significant events for pros.By Williams's side—and often across the net—has been her older sister, Venus, an equally commanding player.
Both sisters spent
several years at the top of the world tennis rankings, each reaching the number-one position in 2002.
As of the summer of 2004,Serena Williamshad won six singles titles in Grand Slam events as well as numerous doubles titles, including a gold medal at the 2000Olympic GamesinSydney,Australia.
An ambitious, multitalented person, Williams has also, since 2002, explored acting, appearing in several television episodes and pursuing film roles as well.
In addition, she has, along with her sister, studied fashion design.
Just watching her is inspiring.
I just want her to have it all.
To be honest, I want more for her than I do for myself.
Venus Williams,Peoplemagazine, June 28, 2004.From diapers to tennis skirtsThe youngest of five daughters born to Richard and Oracene (who goes by the nickname Brandy), Serena and the rest of the Williams family moved from her birthplace of Saginaw, Michigan, to Compton, a suburb ofLos Angeles,California, when she was a baby.
An economically depressed area, Compton is a rough, often violent neighborhood, and the Williams sisters occasionally witnessed exchanges of gunfire.
An avid fan of tennis, Richard Williams envisioned his daughters as champions even before they were born.
He bought books and instructional videotapes, teaching himself and his wife how to play tennis so they could then teach their daughters.
Both Serena and Venus showed promise at a very early age, prompting their outspoken father to begin making predictions about their future success in the tennis world.
Coached by her father, Serena entered her first tennis tournament at age four and a half, and her father recalls that, over the next five years, she won forty-six of the next forty-nine tournaments she entered.
She and Venus both excelled in the highly competitive preteen circuit in Southern California, both attaining a number-one
ranking in their respective age groups.
Before reaching their teen years, the sisters had begun attracting attention far beyond the borders of their home state.
They received offers for endorsement deals from sporting-goods companies and invitations to prestigious tennis camps.In 1991 Richard Williams withdrew the girls from junior tournaments, a decision that was widely criticized by tennis insiders.
The junior circuit is accepted as the conventional path to tennis stardom, but Richard wanted to protect his daughters from the intense competition and from what he perceived as racial hostility from other players.
Richard invited teaching pro Rick Macci—who had earlier coached such tennis stars as Mary Pierce andJennifer Capriati—to come to Compton and watch his daughters play tennis.
Macci came, and he was impressed by the sisters' skill and athleticism.
He invited them to study with him at hisFloridaacademy, and soon after, the family relocated to the Sunshine State.
The proceeds from a clothing endorsement contract for Serena and Venus allowed the family to purchase a home in Palm Beach Gardens, not far from the tennis school.Grand Slam VictoriesSerena Williams has won numerous singles and doubles titles at Grand Slam events (the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open).
Below are listed her victories through the end of the 2003 season:Singles:Australian Open, 2003French Open, 2002Wimbledon, 2002, 2003U.S.
Open, 1999, 2002Doubles (all with sister Venus):Australian Open, 2001, 2003French Open, 1999Wimbledon, 2000, 2002U.S.
Open, 1999Mixed Doubles (both with Max Mirnyi):Wimbledon, 1998U.S.
Open, 1998By 1993 the girls had left school, opting to continue their education at home and spend as much time as possible honing their tennis skills.
Later they both returned to a school setting, enrolling at a small, private school called Driftwood Academy.
Williams graduated from high school in 1999.
In 1995, at age fourteen, Williams turned pro, arousing controversy among many who felt athletes should be older
before they become professionals.
The Women's Tennis Association (WTA), the governing body of women's professional tennis, barred competitors from WTA events at that age, so Williams's first pro event was a non-WTA tournament inQuebec,Canada.
She was quickly eliminated from that competition.
Her introduction to professional play indicated that she needed additional training time, and Richard decided that his youngest daughter should take a break from competition for the remainder of that year and the following year as well.A tentative beginningWilliams began 1997, her first year as a WTA competitor, in the shadow of her sister, who had shown herself to be a promising young player.
The Ameritech Cup inChicago, however, made it clear that Serena Williams was more than just the little sister of Venus: she was a budding star in her own right.
At that tournament, she shocked observers by defeating Mary Pierce, then ranked seventh in the world among women players, in the second round.
Further defying expectations, Williams went on to defeat fourth-rankedMonica Selesin the quarterfinals before losing to Lindsay Davenport in the semifinals.
She completed the 1997 season ranked ninety-nine, an impressive debut year for a sixteen-year-old player.She continued to build her skills and confidence in 1998, beating a number of players ranked far above her.
One such victory—beating ninth-ranked Irina Spirlea in the first round of the Australian Open—led her to a matchup against her sister in the next round.
Venus won that match, a victory that aroused complex emotions for both sisters.
Venus, accustomed to her role as big sister, wanted to take care of and protect her sister.
Serena had spent most of her life looking up to Venus and working to be just like her.
Both sisters, however, also felt an intense drive to win, regardless of who is on the other side of the net.The Williams sisters have since met many times as opponents.
Some observers have suggested that they lack their usual passion when they play each other, a charge both have denied.
Such matchups do result in mixed feelings, however, with the victor feeling both triumphant and regretful.
Serena and Venus are best friends, but they are also intensely competitive with each other, and each sister uses the other's success as motivation to improve.
In a 1998 article, Serena toldSports Illustrated for Kids,"I've learned a lot from watching Venus.
Her results have encouraged me to work harder so that I can do well, too.
The Williams sisters have also played together many times as a doubles team, with 1998 marking the first time the sisters won a professional match together.
Serena also won two Grand Slam mixed doubles titles that year—at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open—with partner Max Mirnyi.
While she had yet to win a major singles title, Williams earned more than $2 million dollars during 1998.
The following year proved even more successful, with Williams winning a number of events.
Her first singles title of the year was at the Paris Indoors tournament; Venus won a tournament the same day inOklahoma City,Oklahoma, marking the first time in the history of professional tennis that two sisters won championships on the same day—or even in the same week.
The professional highlight of the year came when Williams defeated three of the top-four tennis players in the world to win the singles title at the U.S. Open.
It was her first singles victory at a Grand Slam event, and the first time in more than forty years—sinceAlthea Gibson's win in 1958—that an African American woman won a Grand Slam singles title.
Another 1999 milestone was Williams's first professional victory over her sister, beating Venus in the Grand Slam Cup.
The two teamed up to win two Grand Slam doubles events that year, at the French Open and the U.S. Open.
Williams finished the 1999 season as the fourth-ranked women's player in the world.UnstoppableThe following two years proved difficult for Williams, with a series of injuries resulting in a number of losses and forcing her to withdraw from several tournaments.
High points of the 2000 season included doubles victories, with Venus as her partner, at both Wimbledon and the Olympic Games.
The sisters won the doubles title at the Australian Open in 2001, marking their dominance in doubles at all four Grand Slam events.Having recovered in spectacular fashion from her various injuries and illnesses of the preceding years, Williams seemed unstoppable in 2002.
The best players in the women's game were no match for her unparalleled strength and speed on the court.
She was victorious in eight out of the eleven tournaments she entered, earning nearly
4 million in prize money.
At the NASDAQ-100 Open inMiami, Florida, Williams defeated the top three players in the world, including her sister, to win the singles title.
This achievement marked one of many history-making wins: she joined tennis greatSteffi Graf(1969–) as the only ones to defeat the world's three best players in one tournament.
Three times that year—at the French Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open—Serena met Venus in the finals of a Grand Slam event, and three times she defeated her sister.
After her victory at Wimbledon, Williams became the top-ranked women's tennis player in the world.
During the U.S. Open Serena wore a one-piece black outfit made by Puma, a company she had signed a hefty endorsement deal with a few years earliers.
The outfit—so different from the traditional white tennis dress—attracted nearly as much attention as Williams's playing.
The real story of 2002, however, was that she was one of just seven women in the history of the game to win three consecutive Grand Slam titles in a single year.The following year, 2003, Williams completed her sweep of Grand Slam events, beating her sister to win the singles title at the Australian Open.
She won a number of other significant singles titles that year, including a second consecutive win at Wimbledon.
She held on to her number-one ranking for over a year, until August of 2003.
Williams's extraordinary success was recognized by the cable sports network ESPN during its annual ESPY awards program: she won the ESPY for best female tennis player and best female athlete.
The year proved a difficult one regarding injuries, but such problems seemed insignificant compared to the tragedy Williams and her family endured in September of 2003: her sister, Yetunde Price, was killed inLos Angeles, a victim of a random act of violence.Life outside of tennisFor much of 2004, Williams dealt with a recurring knee injury.
She won the NASDAQ-100 Open in Miami for the third year in a row, but at many other tournaments of the year she was either defeated or had to
withdraw due to injury.
Her pursuits outside of tennis began taking up more of her time as well, particularly her efforts to become an actress.
Beginning in 2002, Williams started earning guest roles on various television shows, includingMy Wife and Kids,Showtime'sStreet Time,andLaw and Order.She also scored a part inHair Show,a feature film completed in 2004.
Williams told Alex Tresniowski ofPeoplemagazine that she's a natural-born performer: "If I hadn't played tennis, I was destined to be an actress.
I'm a complete drama queen.
Williams has, in spite of her tremendous wealth and success, remained down to earth.
She is a devoutJehovah's Witness, a Christian denomination that involves intensiveBiblestudy and the preaching of biblical teachings to others.
While some have criticized the Williams sisters for what they perceive to be arrogance and unfriendliness, Serena and Venus have also developed a reputation for avoiding petty exchanges of insults among tennis players.
As world-famous tennis stars, they have been the subject of numerous rumors and negative reports in the media, but they try to ignore such press.
In an interview withOprah WinfreyforO, The Oprah Magazine,Serena reported that she doesn't care what others think of her—"as long as my family knows who I am.
And I know that a lie can't live forever.
Most of the lies people tell about us are eventually washed away, so they don't bother me."
Williams attributes her levelheadedness to her strong family relationships and spiritual background.
My mom raised us to be strong women," she told Winfrey.
We were taught that things like peer pressure didn't exist for us.

With her older sister Venus she formed half of a tennis-prodigy pair that had been making headlines from an early age.
She has the potential to rise to the very top of the game.Serena Williams was born in Saginaw,Michigan, on September 26, 1981, but she and her sister were raised in the economically depressed and often violence-riddledLos Angelessuburb of Compton.
Her father Richard ran a private security firm, and her mother Oracene (who often uses the name Brandy) was a nurse.
His ambitions went nowhere with the first three of his five daughters, but Venus, born in 1980, and Serena, the youngest daughter, showed promise from the start.“Venus and Serena took to tennis as soon as rackets were put in their hands,”older sister Lyn-drea toldSportmagazine.Ducked Gunfire in PracticeThe sisters’early training took place on public tennis courts in and around Compton, where they remember having to duck gunfire.
She succeeded Venus as the number-one player in southernCalifornia’s highly competitive age-12-and-under rankings, and well before reaching adolescence both sisters had attracted national attention in the form of invitations to prestigious tennis camps, promises of lucrative product-endorsementAt a Glance…Born September 26, 1981inSaginaw, Michigan; Father Richard a security agency owner and tennis coach; mother Oracene (Brandy) a nurse.Education:home schooled for last several years of high school.Religion:Jehovah’s Witness.Career:Tennis professional.
Won 46 of 49 tournaments entered, 1985–1991; trained underFloridatennis pro Ric Macci, 1991-; turned professional, 1995, and made debut at tournament in Vanier,Quebec; victory over second-seedMonica Seles,Chicago, 1997; ranking improved from number 304 to number 21, 1997–98; victory over world’s second-ranked player, Lindsay Davenport,Sydney,Australia, 1998; signed $12 million endorsement contract with Puma, 1998.Addresses:c/o Women’s Tennis Association, 133 First Street NE,St.
Petersburg, FL 33701.deals, and glowing newspaper reportage.In 1991 Richard Williams, who remains manager and coach to both Serena and Venus, made the first of several unorthodox moves in regard to his daughters’career: he decided that they should enter no more tournaments on the national junior circuit.
Richard Williams has said that he hoped to avoid subjecting his daughters to competitive pressures, including an undertone of racial hostility (although they say they have not encountered overt racism as professional players).
Serena and Venus were sent to the Florida tennis academy of teaching pro Ric Macci, who had also worked with teenage standoutsJennifer Capriatiand Mary Pierce, and thanks to Richard’s canny handling of a clothing endorsement deal, the family was able to move to a rambling estate in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.
Still banned from World Tennis Association events at that age, Serena made her professional debut in October of 1995 at the non-WTA Bell Challenge in Vanier, Quebec,Canada, losing in less than an hour to a virtual unknown.
But her father, who has defenders as well as critics on the tennis circuit, offered constant encouragement, and the play of both sisters improved dramatically.“Nobody knows those girls better than their parents—the road they’ve gone on couldn’t have been better selected,”legendary coach Nick Bol-lettieri toldNewsweek.
By 1998 Venus was one of the top ten players in the world.
Serena, ranked number 304 in 1997, made her first big splash that year with a victory over second seedMonica Selesat an Ameritech-sponsored tournament in Chicago.Beat World’s Second-Ranked PlayerBy the following year her world ranking had risen as high as number 21, and both Serena andVenus Williamswere bona-fide celebrities.
Serena served notice that her time had come when she advanced to the semifinals of a Sydney, Australia tournament by beating the then second-ranked woman in the world, Lindsay Davenport, who went on to become theUnited StatesOpen champion that year.
Expected to do well in her first“Grand Slam”tournament, the Australian Open, she had the bad luck of having to face her sister Venus in the second round after ousting sixth seed Irina Spirlea in the first.Venus emerged victorious, andEssencemagazine reported that she was heard to say,“I’m sorry I had to take you out, Serena,”as the two sisters walked off the court.
It seems likely that whatever the unorthodox twists of their young careers, the success of the Williams sisters has come in part from having each other as training partners, confidantes, and occasional rivals.“They haven’t admitted to it, but there’s definitely a competitiveness between Serena and Venus,”former U.S. Open finalist Pam Shriver toldSport.“They motivate each other and feed off each other’s successes.
10 ranking has definitely inspired Serena to improve her ranking,”she continued.Observers Predict Future SuccessIndeed, many observers of the two sisters have been moved to wonder which of them might in the end become the stronger player, and some have answered the question in Serena’s favor, noting her deep competitive drive and her powerful physique.“Serena seems built to last,”Newsweeknoted, pointing out that“her more compact, muscular frame is ideal for a powerful, all-around game.”Such speculations must have placed pressure on Serena and Venus as they embarked on a tough summer of tournament play in 1998, and major championships eluded them both.
Serena suffered through ups and downs in her game in a 6–3, 0–6, 7–5 loss to Spirlea at the U.S. Open inNew York; the contest had been widely heralded as a grudge match after Spirlea had collided with Venus during a court changeover in an earlier tournament, but went off without incident.Although known for antagonizing her fellow players, Serena’s brash confidence, charisma, and impressive physical appearance made her attractive to the advertising departments of major corporations, and she signed a deal worth roughly $12 million with the Puma sporting-goods concern.
An intelligent and energetic teenager with interests in many fields outside of tennis—she hopes to become a movie star in time—she could contemplate many different paths when thinking about her future.
Richard Williams was even quoted as saying inJetthat he hoped his daughters would quit tennis and move on to other things.
But in 1998 it seemed likely that her tennis career had not yet reached the top of its trajectory.“My great moments are in the future,”she toldSport“I have a lot of photos in my scrapbook, but I’m waiting for the right cover shot.
It has to be huge, like winning a big title,”she concluded.SourcesPeriodicalsArizona Republic, September 5, 1998, C2.Essence, August 1998, p. 78.Jet, September 21, 1998, p. 49.New YorkTimes, March 16, 1997.Newsweek, August 24, 1998, p. 44.Sport, July 1998, p. 70.Sports Illustrated, June 13, 1994, p. 10.Wall StreetJournal, August 31, 1998, p.

Williams has an obvious sweet tooth and won't hesitate to put away a beignet, which is basically a deep-fried nugget of sugary dough.A post shared by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams)Nov 28, 2017 at 5:26pm PSTWhen it comes to lunches, or general snacking, Williams never refuses a taco — and they are an ever-present feature of the tennis champion's Instagram.A post shared by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams)Oct 4, 2016 at 5:37am PDTWilliams once said on Facebook: "I want tacos.
Everyday I want tacos.

For years I was always making gumbo for everyone," she told Bon Appétit.
My other go-to dishes are something I call a 'seven-bean delight' which really only has five beans, but don't tell.
And roasted chicken with garlic.

I love moon pies," she told Bon Appétit.

What Serena Williams Typically Eats In A Day×NEWSEXCLUSIVESROYALSBEAUTYSTYLEWELLNESSLOVELIVINGPOLITICSENTERTAINMENTFEATURESAboutEditorial PoliciesPrivacy PolicyTerms of Use© 2023Static Media®.
All Rights ReservedWhat Serena Williams Typically Eats In A DayNEWSEXCLUSIVESROYALSBEAUTYSTYLEWELLNESSLOVELIVINGPOLITICSENTERTAINMENTFEATURESFoodWhat Serena Williams Typically Eats In A DayGetty ImagesByBrittany Brolley/Updated: July 20, 2021  12:59 pm ESTSerena Williams seems to exude body confidence from every fiber of her being.
Seriously, does it come from her pores?
Despite being a fantastic role model for women, she doesn't always feel that way.
In fact, she feelsunconfidentin her body more often than not.
Unless I'm eating really healthy," Williams explained to Fitness Magazine (viaSports Illustrated) "I feel [less than confident] almost every other week."
The four-time Olympic gold tennis champion confessed that there are plenty of times when she wishes she could "do better" or "be smaller."
She pointed to the way women are taught to look as the reason for these feelings.Still, Williams has adopted a healthier lifestyle, but not necessarily to get skinnier — it was for her former roommate.
It all started because I didn't want to bring bad food into the house.
I live with my sister, Venus, who has Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease," Williams candidly told the magazine.
Williams also found out that she is allergic to wheat, prompting her to adopt a new style of eating.
So, just what does a typical menu look like for this tennis star?
Keep on reading.She rarely eats breakfastShutterstockAs part of her initiative to eat healthier, Serena Williams said she's "trying to eat a clean diet of natural, raw foods."
Nevertheless, she finds it difficult to wake up early and scarf down a healthy breakfast.
In a 2017Vanity Fairprofile of Williams, the tennis star is described as "not a morning person" and one that "usually doesn't eat breakfast.
The night before Williams' first match at the Italian Open, however, was a different story.
Williams was actually going to try the breakfast buffet at the Cavalieri hotel in Rome.
Can you blame her?
Unfortunately for the tennis star, the buffet closed just five minutes before she sat down.
But, in a twist of fate, Williams ended up choosing a table beside the pool to order a sit-down meal.
This is where Williams would meet her eventual husband and father of her child, Alexis Ohanian.
Aww.
Williams must be thankful that she was in the mood for breakfast that morning.She strives to eat protein and carbsShutterstockJust as Serena Williams finds it difficult to eat breakfast, she also struggles with eating before a match.
When asked about her pre-match go-to grub, Williams revealed the truth toGlamour, saying, "Usually I can't [eat].
And I haven't been able to figure out why — it must be nerves!
In her last match prior to her interview with the magazine, she explained that she did choke back "some turkey sausage and a baked potato" before competing.
If you're wondering if Williams opts for turkey sausage because it'sregarded as healthier, that might not necessarily be the determining factor for the tennis star.
I'm not really into pork," Williams later added.Although she finds eating before a match hard to do, she appreciates the power of the all-important combo:protein and carbs.
When she is successful at convincing herself to eat before competing, this is the formula she tries to follow.
Tries" being the operative word, of course.Becoming a 'vega-tarian'ShutterstockSerena Williams may sometimes opt for animal protein, but she's also begunembracing veganism.
Well, perhaps pseudo-veganism.
After having a baby, Williams toldThe New York Timesthat she wanted to "lean out" and, in doing so, knew she had to eat healthier.
I went vegan for 44 days," said Williams.
Because it worked so well for her, she decided to try it again.
She clarified, saying, "But now, I'm vega-tarian."
Williams explained how she loves European cheeses and, since she planned to head to Europe soon, she decided she'll indulge in the dairy product and explore the middle ground between being a vegetarian and a vegan.Williams' sister has also started following a loosely vegan diet.
Venus calls us 'chegan' — because we cheat with a little bit of fish and chicken," Williams toldBon Appétit.
Williams didn't always appreciate a plant-based diet, though.
For me, green' used to mean 'yuck.'
But I've incorporated a lot of raw things in my diet this year," she said.What happens in South Carolina stays in South CarolinaShutterstockSerena Williams may be a mostly-vegetarian and an overall healthy eater, but that doesn't mean she's going to give up her favorite foods.
When speaking to Fitness Magazine (viaSports Illustrated), Williams put it simply, saying, "I love Southern food."
Williams loves it so much that she says she doesn't even attempt to eat healthy when in South Carolina for the Family Circle Cup tournament.
And when she says she doesn't try, she really, really means that.
I eat shrimp and grits with butter on top, fried chicken, and, oh, do I eat the fried hush puppies!
And the banana pudding — mmm, mmm, mmm!
I let myself go that whole week and then another week after that," Williams detailed.While that kind of diet sounds amazing, quite frankly, it's certainly worth remembering that Williams works outinsanelyhard, withtennis matches lasting for hoursat a time.
And even so, she said she "can't take cheat days too often because [her] cheat days are usually cheat months!"
We feel you, Serena.Celebratory pizza — hold the pepperoniShutterstockEven though Serena Williams has a hard time eating before a match, the same does not apply as soon as the match is finished.
And if she happens to win said match, the meal she chooses may be a little less than healthy.
Pizza, for instance, is her preferred celebratory meal.
She's not usually one for fancy toppings and instead specified toGlamourthat she likes to eat it plain — "just cheese."
Williams' favorite pizza comes from Bella Vita, a pizzeria based out of, you guessed it, New York.Williams may try to limit her cheat days to when she's visiting the southern states, but she still finds a way to eat things that many would consider to be far from diet-friendly.
I had fries with lunch today," Williams admitted.
Although, she did make it a point not to eat them all.
But I'm not going to deprive myself," she clarified.
You do you, girl!Winner, winner, chicken dinnerInstagramAs a sometimes-vegetarian, sometimes-not, Serena Williams likely still eats chicken now and again.
Her mom's "chicken, with rice and gravy" is William's favorite dish — and has been since she was a young child.
Even as an adult, she asks her mom to make up a batch for her.
I was just competing in Australia, and she was going to make it for me, but she forgot.
Now she owes me!"
Williams toldBon Appétitin 2013.The tennis superstar also has her own roast chicken recipe.
I make it French style," she explained.
Williams uses whole garlic cloves, placing some under the skin and inside the chicken.
I put butter on top of the bird, and butter inside the gut," Williams said, revealing her recipe.
She clarified, saying, "It's not a light dish!"
With a little salt and pepper, baby onions, and olive oil, Williams roasts the chicken.
Vegan or not, it sounds delicious!Her tastes are ever-changingShutterstockRoasted chicken dinners are not the only thing Serena Williams cooks.
For years, I was always making gumbo for everyone," she toldBon Appétit.
Then she started making "seven-bean delight."
Williams came clean and said that it actually only hasfivebeans.
But don't tell," she joked.
For a while, turkey tacos were her go-to, but now as she transitions to a more vegan-centric diet, she makes "vegan sushi.
Williams told of her love of cooking, which she feels she got from her family.
I grew up watching my mom in the kitchen, that's how I know anything about cooking," said Williams.
Despite being a world-renowned athlete, culinary classes are something she's always been interested in taking up.
For now, though, the star learns from watching her mom and celebrity chefs, like Emeril Lagassé, Bobby Flay, and Masaharu Morimoto.
That guy is awesome," Williams remarked.
Imagine being called awesome by none other than Serena Williams?
Life goals.You'll never catch her eating these foodsShutterstockSerena Williams keeps a well-stocked and healthy fridge.
Mostly all vegan, Williams toldBon Appétitthat you'd find "coconut water, Gatorade ([her] favorite!
 cucumbers, mint, kale, vegetables, ginger, and wheat grass" if you were to peer inside.
There are a few things you'll never, ever see Williams eating though.
I hateavocados," the champion admitted.
What?
Serena, no!
The texture is so yucky in my mouth," she explained.
Okay, maybe we'll give her a free pass.
Williams listed off several other foods she's not a fan of, including tomatoes.
If diced into small pieces, Williams says she "can get them down," but eating tomatoes is obviously not the most enjoyable experience for her.Despite liking the majority of Japanese food, Williams said there's one Japanese cuisine she just can't handle.
I can't do those fish eggs that are really fat, big, and orange.
I don't like those," she added.
Wait — does this mean there are people whodoactually like eating those?She's a tacoholicShutterstockFor being the driven and dedicated super-fit athlete we all know and love, Serena Williams has proven that even she has to find the balance between eating healthy and eating not so healthy.
She also battles food cravings — on the daily.
I want tacos.
Everyday I want tacos," Williams wrote in aFacebook post, "I don't know what to do?
Is there help for someone that wants to eat tacos everyday?"
While the first step may be to admit you have a problem, Tacoholics Anonymous isn't yet a thing.
Williams explained why she's so obsessed with the food toUSA Today, saying, "I grew up next to all of these Mexican families and we were close with them when I was little, we were friends.
I think that's where my love for tacos comes from."
Williams also claims to make the best tacos, but joked, saying, "I don't taco about it.
With Serena Williams' otherwise healthy eating plan, you probably don't have to worry about her taco addictiontoomuch.
Besides, it's nacho problem.Recommended

Ever wonder how she fuels those powerful serves?
So did we, which is why we went right to the source, to ask one of the two most famous sisters in tennis about how she eats, how she cooks, and what victory truly tastes like.Is there a Williams-family signature dish?Serena Williams: That's easy: My mom's chicken, with rice and gravy.
It was my favorite dish as a kid, and it still is now.
That's my favorite meal from her or from anybody.
I was just competing in Australia, and she was going to make it for me, but she forgot.
Now she owes me!
It's a family favorite.
But there are more.
Venus cooks a lot.
My other two other sisters cook.
For years, I was always making gumbo for everyone.
My other go-to dishes are something I call a "seven-bean delight," which really only has five beans, but don't tell.
Everyone loves my roasted chicken with garlic; for a minute, it was my turkey tacos.
Now it's vegan sushi.
I just love to cook!Can you recite one of those recipes by heart?SW: The easiest is my roasted chicken recipe.
I make it French style.
I put whole cloves of garlic all over the dish.
Some under the skin, some inside the chicken, some inside the pan.
I put butter on top of the bird, and butter inside the gut.
It's not a light dish!
I add only a little salt and pepper, not too much.
Then I throw small baby onions everywhere, drizzle olive oil on top and roast away.Is there a cookbook you're obsessed with?SW: My go-to cookbook is calledEat Yourself Sexy!
I've been eating a lot healthier for my sister [Ed note: This is because of Venus'sSjogren Syndrome] so the cookbook has all these raw meals, green juices, and smoothies.
For me, "green" used to mean "yuck."
But I've incorporated a lot of raw things in my diet this year.
Venus calls us "chegan"—because we cheat with a little bit of fish and chicken.If you could eat a meal cooked by any chef in the world, who would it be?SW: My mom!
I grew up watching my mom in the kitchen, that's how I know anything about cooking.
I've always wanted to go to a culinary class actually.
Besides my mom, I love Bobby Flay, Emeril, Morimoto—that guy is awesome.What are your favorite Wimbledon eats?SW: For Wimbledon, our chef,Lauren Von Der Pool, travels with us because I try to eat really healthy at that one.
No roasted chicken on that trip for me.
We have either her or my mom make our meals around match time.
Unfortunately, there's no real "restaurant-hopping" when I'm away.
Truthfully, I don't eat a lot before my matches.
I can't eat because I get too nervous.
I'll force myself to really carb up the night before, especially later on in the tournament, because I know I wont be able to eat in the morning.
But carbing-up doesn't mean pasta—I'm more into brown rice or sprouted quinoa.What do you eat once you win?SW: Celebration food is always my mom's chicken.
I request it every time, along with her biscuits.Are you a sweet or savory person?SW: I'm the deadliest of both: savoryandsweet.
I love those molten lava cakes, the ones where you cut into it and the chocolate spills out.
Even if it's terrible, I can't say no to those.
The best ones are at Nobu because they serve it with green tea ice cream.
Ridiculously delicious.If you could get an endorsement deal from any food, what would it be?SW: Oh my god, I don't know!
Okay.
I love moon pies.
If "Moon Pie" sponsored me, I'd be bigger than any house on this planet!
Now I really want a Moon Pie!Describe your last dinner party.SW: I cook for my family a lot, but I've only thrown one proper dinner party, and it was when I was in my gumbo stage.
I made a fish-based gumbo because I don't eat red meat or pork.
It was basically seared barramundi with mangoes over quinoa, and kale with a mustard sauce on the side.What's your ideal dinner party music?SW: Either soft '90s or jazz.
John Coltrane, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and you can't play jazz without Miles Davis.If you could cook dinner for anyone, who would it be and what would you serve?SW: Arthur Ashe and Althea Gibson, because they were black and played tennis, andthatwasn't popular in their time.
Both are dead now, but I'd really love to have them over.
I'd just make a quick salad so we could talk and talk.What does victory taste like?SW: Victory is very, very sweet.
It tastes better than any dessert you've ever had.Do you drink?SW: I'm very much a glass-of-wine girl.
I love Cabernets, and most French wines.
But I'm not a wine snob—I'm cool with a $7 bottle of Riesling from the local Publix.Where is your dream eating trip?SW: I have to say: South Carolina.
I love the Southern palate.
Those southern meals, there's nothing like it.
I'm always eating really healthy now, so I dream of those.What's always in your fridge?SW: My fridge is really just vegan: coconut water, Gatorade (my favorite!
 cucumbers, mint, kale, vegetables, ginger, and wheat grass.What foods do you detest?SW: I hate avocados.
The texture is so yucky in my mouth.

So if you're wondering exactly what Serena eats on the reg, here's what her daily menu looks like.BreakfastEven though Serena likes to stick to a plant-based diet, she occasionally eats eggs in the morning.

It's just like, I never want to see pasta again," she says jokingly.Her diet actually has a distinct personality.
I can have a smoothie for six months," she says.

I'm here to tell you that I'm evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.

My daughter and I love to use our imaginations to go anywhere we want from the comfort and safety of our backyard," says Williams to TZR via email.
The zoo has become our new favorite place 'to go.

In fact, Williams' latest campaign withtravel company Awaywas inspired by some of the make-believe vacations she's taken with her daughter and husband (Alexis Ohanian) this past year.
We had a lot of fun with this idea when doing the photo shoot for this collection," says Williams.
We really playfully recreated some of my favorite cities using backdrops, props, and even a kiddie pool.
While stuck at home, it’s been really fun to get creative and figure out new ways to satisfy our wanderlust.
That's not to say Williams isn't looking forward to hitting the road again with her family in tow.
The new collaboration with Away — the athlete's second with the brand — is inspired by her own family-centric travel needs.
I wanted to create a collection that spoke to traveling as a family, since it's one of the most important things to me," says Williams.
This collection includes a Kid’s Carry-On, a Pet Carrier, as well as a full line of luggage and travel accessories.
...] Like many people, I’ve been dreaming of the world opening back up, and this collection is already inspiring me toplan some new adventureswhen it’s safe.
In the meantime, it's imaginary zoo trips, Disney sing-alongs, and baking parties with Olympia for this 23-time Grand Slam  tennis champion.
And she'd have it no other way: "This time has really allowed us to connect and play together, so I am very grateful.

Entertainmenthide captiontoggle captionEric Charbonneau/Warner Bros. EntertainmentThe cast of King Richard at the Los Angeles Premiere AFI Fest 2021 (L-R: Demi Singleton, Serena Williams, Will Smith, Venus Williams, Saniyya Sidney, Aunjanue Ellis).Eric Charbonneau/Warner Bros. EntertainmentKing Richardis up for Best Picture and five other categories at this year's Academy Awards.
It's the story of tennis superstars Venus and Serena Williams and their family.
To give their stamp of approval to the production, Isha Price, one of the three older sisters, was on set every day to make sure the filmmakers told their story authentically.
We've been approached different times about doing a movie, and it never seemed to be right because the story's still being written," Price says.
This script was different.
Price says her family appreciated how the film is really Venus Williams' origin story, before she wonseven Grand Slam singles titles, five Wimbledon championships and four Olympic gold medals.
And long before her little sister Serena won23 Grand Slam singles titlesof her own, seven Wimbledon championships and four Olympic gold medals.
Serena is hands down the GOAT, she's the best has ever done it," says Price.
But even she said historically that that doesn't happen without Venus, that there had to be somebody to bust that door open.
It was Richard Williams who planned for his daughters to become tennis royals even before they were born.
The size and scope of the dream was so huge that it it bordered on insanity," says Will Smith, who's nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for playing Williams."
It's sort of where you have to live if you want to do something that's never been done before.

Entertainment Inc.Aunjanue Ellis is nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for portraying Oracene Price, the queen to king Richard.
Ellis says they shared the vision.
They were like, 'Let's create tennis champions.
Mr. Richard was the architect of the dream and Mrs. Price was the builder of that dream.
The film opens in the late 1980's, early 1990's when the family lived in Compton.
Venus and Serena practiced in battered tennis courts while their dadworked the night shift as a security guard, and reigned over his family with love, humor and determination.
Have some fun out there," he would tell him daughters on the tennis courts.
That's what this is about.
Williams was their coach before moving the family to Florida for professional training.
He made waves for his audacious business plans and for taking the girls out of stressful tennis competitions so they could be kids.
This is a man who was battered and maligned in the press," Smith notes.
And in retrospect, if you look at it, it was only because he was trying to protect his daughters.
Warner Bros. EntertainmentYouTubeIn one scene, Williams confronts police officers called to their house by a nosy neighbor who wanted them to check on the five daughters.
We got future doctors, lawyers, plus a couple tennis stars in this house," he tells them.
What you not gonna never do is come knock on this door, talking about you have to blow they damn brains out in them streets 'cause they runnin' with hoodlums and doing drugs and things.
That's what you not never gonna never see in this house.
Later, Williams encourages Venus to take her tennis further, when she says she's ready. "
You not gonna just be representing you," he tells her, "You gonna be representing every little Black girl on Earth.
Smith, one of the film's producers, says he got into character by speaking and dressing like Richard Williams.Pop Culture Happy HourKing Richard is Will Smith at his Oscar-iest"The equivalent of his crown was those short shorts," Smith chuckles.
Yeah, it sounds like a joke, but when I put those short shorts on, I really felt into Richard Williams.
I understood, oh, wait a second, he thinks he's fly.
And I realize, oh, he has an image in his mind of what the tennis parent mogul looks like.
Meanwhile, Oracene quietly worked as a nurse to support the family.
Ellis says the matriarch coached Serena behind the scenes.
Now people will know the truth of that," she says.
I do think the triumph ofKing Richardis that you get to see a reflection of this beautiful Black family.

She also coached Serena behind the scenes.Warner Bros. EntertainmentIt was important to the Williams family and Director Reinaldo Marcus Green that the film also get the tennis moves correctly, demonstrating Venus and Serena's powerful lobs and open stance plays.
But I was less interested in making a tennis movie," Green says, "This was a movie about a family that had tennis in it.
Green says their stories were familiar to him, having grown up in a rough New York neighborhood playing baseball, and being coached by his dad.
My father wore those short shorts and I understood how a Black man with a big personality could be misunderstood for being outspoken."
He says he too, "had a father that raised us with love.
To write the screenplay, Zach Baylin referenced anecdotes from Richard Williams' memoir, and books by Serena Williams and coach Rick Macci.
Baylin and the producers also interviewed Oracene Price.
She read the script and said that was what was most important for her was that we didn't make her look like a chump," says Baylin.
She can be a very soft-spoken person, but when she does choose to speak, she's very intentional and very strong and pointed, and she wanted that to come across.
Just before the film shoot wrapped, Isha Price, Venus and Serena Williams officially signed on as executive producers.
Will Smith says their support meant the world.
They called me directly after they saw it and Venus said 'thank you for telling the world truth about our daddy.
But Smith says he's still dying to know Richard Williams' reaction.
Serena was like, 'He says he hasn't seen it yet.
We've been trying to get him to watch.
And she said 'it's not beyond daddy to have watched it and don't tell us.

WILLIAMS: She's the only reason I'm standing here today and the only reason that the Williams sisters exist.
So thank you, Venus, for inspiring me.
APPLAUSE)GARCIA-NAVARRO: Serena Williams beat her big sister, Venus, on Saturday to win the Australian Open.
It's her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, a new record.
In this week's edition of Out Of Bounds, our ongoing conversation about sports and culture, we talk with Clinton Yates.
He's a writer for the ESPN website The Undefeated and penned an intensely personal essay about how he came to admit that Serena is his favorite athlete of all time.Thanks for coming here.CLINTON YATES: Anytime.GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to talk about this article which caught our eye.
You wrote that it took you years to be able to say this out loud.
Say it.
What is it?YATES: Serena Williams is my favorite athlete of all time.GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK (laughter), tell us, why was it so hard for you, as a man, to admire a woman athlete?YATES: I think there's two reasons.
No.
1, is that as somebody that grew up - you know, I played three sports in high school.
I played soccer.
I played basketball.
I played baseball.
So my entire, sort of, psychological link to what I cared about in sports was very much toward, No.
1, those sports and No.
2, people who I saw who I felt were better at team games.But I also think that too many athletes are so caught up, from an identity standpoint, in one thing or another thing - whether it's being a woman, whether it's being black or whether it's being someone who's not American.
In this case, Serena obviously is American.
But you know how sometimes there's something that you like and you keep returning to it and you don't really have a reason why?
And then something happens and you're like - wow, I know a lot more about that than I cared to realize.And it was when she last won Wimbledon, and I just looked at myself, and I said - I don't know that there's another person I'd rather watch play sports.
And that's all I do for a living, you know what I mean?
And...GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was the moment for you?YATES: That was the moment for me.
It was the last Wimbledon where I said - wow, not only is she my favorite athlete from a standpoint of playing the game, but I am here for the fashion.
I am here for what she does off the court.
I am here for her eloquence and intelligence and personal standards.
The situation that happened at Indian Wells - she didn't play there for years because she felt it was a racist location, and she was not going to deal with that.GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to come back to this idea of you - obviously - as a man, making this admission about a woman athlete.
What has been the reaction when you talked about this on Twitter, when you've talked about this publicly?
What has been the reaction among other men?YATES: The first reaction I got to that was some guy said, I'm having a hard time imagining you wearing a tennis skirt, which instantly indicated to me where most people are at, from a guy's standpoint, when it comes to what they think about women.
They are ultimately just objects of desire or of their gaze.
So a lot of guys, for me, reacted - oh, come on, how could you say something like that?
And it's like well, you know, sorry, dude - I don't look at all women as sex objects, No.
And No.
2, I don't view all things that women do in athletic context as lesser than.And that - those two things right there are more than most men are not only willing to do but need to do.
That's the problem.
You know, this is what toxic masculinity and patriarchy bring to you in society - is that if you don't have to do that, you will not do that.
And so once I, you know, made that personal growth point, which was 10, 15 odd years ago, you know, it's not hard for me to say that.GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what did you think of the match?YATES: The grace that they showed toward each other, the actual competitiveness that they show on the court, it's really, really something to see.
And if you haven't gotten a chance to watch it, it's worth watching the fullness of the match from entrance to exit, not just the part where they're hitting the tennis balls because their relationship is so special like that.GARCIA-NAVARRO: Clinton Yates is a writer for The Undefeated.
Thanks.YATES: Pas de quoi.Copyright © 2017 NPR.

Overall, a fifth of tennis fans name Serena Williams (21%) as one of their favourite athletes, meaning she is almost twice as popular as the next female athlete on the list – Naomi Osaka (12%).The fact that Williams retains such a high position on the ladder in spite of her appearances on court becoming increasingly sporadic in recent years is a testament to her enduring legacy.Among her compatriots, Serena Williams isthefavorite tennis athlete, with two in five American tennis fans (38%) indicating the same, leaving behind Roger Federer (30%), Rafael Nadal (30%) and Novak Djokovic (24%) by some margin.Not just in the US, but Williams enjoys outsized popularity in a variety of nations in the Americas.
Two-fifths of Colombian (41%) and Mexican (40%) tennis fans say she is their favourite tennis athlete, as do three in ten Brazilians (31%) and a quarter of Canadians (26%).In most markets across the globe, she is the top female tennis player.
The notable exceptions to this trend being China, Japan, Germany, and Australia, where homegrown stars like Zhang Shuai, Naomi Osaka, Angelique Kerber, and Ash Barty supersede Williams in popularity.Off the field, the 23-time champion has been an icon for inclusivity and feminism.
Have her efforts made an impact on society?
Looking at YouGov Profiles data from the US, we find that Serena Williams fans are significantly likelier than all sports fans todisagreewith the statement “watching women’s sport is not as exciting as watching men’s”.
Nearly half of Serena Williams fans (45%) disagree with that statement compared to just 29% of all sports fans.
Williams fans are much more likely to find the excitement in women’s sport.Serena Williams fans are also 14 percentage points likelier to feel that “men and women are still not treated equally in the workplace” (84% vs 70% of all sports fans) and are nine points likelier to opine that “sports need to be more inclusive” (68% vs 57%).Williams leaves the court having made an indelible mark on the history of tennis and on the sporting landscape in general – but with still more work to be done by the authorities on equality according to her fans.Discover moresports contenthereWant to run your own research?Start building a survey nowExplore ourliving data– for free.Make smarter business decisions with better intelligence.

She is best known for being both the mother and coach ofVenusandSerena Williams, who are both widely regarded among the best tennis players of all time.
She is the former wife ofRichard Williams, whom she divorced in 2002.Biography[edit]Nicknamed "Brandy", Price was born in Saginaw, Michigan in 1952.
Her father was an automotive worker from theMississippi Delta.
1]She graduated from Buena Vista High School in 1970 and fromWestern Michigan University.
1][2]She has three daughters from a previous marriage to Yusef Rasheed:Yetunde Price(1972–2003),[3]who was a former beauty salon owner and registered nurse; Lyndrea Price, a Web designer; and Isha Price, a lawyer.
After Rasheed's death, while working as a nurse, Oracene marriedRichard Williamsand had two more daughters,Venus WilliamsandSerena Williams.
Both Venus and Serena are high-ranked professional tennis players who have won numerousGrand Slamtournaments.
She helped her husband as he began coaching Venus and Serena in tennis.
The Williams family moved toFloridaon the offer ofRick Maccito coach their daughters for free.
4][5]By the end of 2000, Price was no longer living with her husband Richard Williams, and citing irreconcilable differences, they divorced in 2002.
She reverted to her maiden name of Price.
6][7]During a semifinal match between Serena  andJustine Heninat the2003 French Open, Williams was booed by fans after a complaint about a line call.
Price believes that the boos were motivated by race, saying "We, as black people, live with this all the time.
It's all about control.
8]Tennis journalist and authorL.
Jon Wertheimhas said of Price, "You have to respect anyone incapable of gloss or spin (i.e., unwilling to lie).
9]Price describes herself as a deeply spiritual woman.
10]Price also has described herself as being a "rampantfeminist" when dealing with the overly sexualized images of women in the media.
11]She traveled to Kenya with her daughter Serena for charity work, as well as Senegal to aid in the construction of schools.
10]Price was portrayed byAunjanue Ellisin the 2021 biopicKing Richard.
Ellis was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actressfor her performance while the film itself was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Picture.Coaching[edit]Price's coaching has arguably been overshadowed by her role as mother, but as a coach she has been called underappreciated.
12]Price is not a coach in a traditional sense (though she did learn tennis herself to help teach her daughters the technical aspects of the game) and is instead credited, along with Richard  for helping to build a solid foundation of self-esteem and outside interests for her daughters.
13]Venus and Serena's "poise under pressure"[14]is often credited to the self-belief instilled in them by their mother.
There's no such thing as pressure," says Price.
As black Americans, that's all we've ever had.
It's life.
So where's the pressure?
15]This approach was coupled with, according to noted tennis coachNick Bollettieri, a respect that meant that neither Price nor Richard Williams raised their voices to their daughters.
16]Journalist Bonnie D. Ford has said that the longevity exhibited by the Williams sisters is directly attributable to their parents and the way that Richard Williams and Price have helped them manage their careers and lives.
Ford believes it is especially admirable that Price and her former husband have continued to remain jointly supportive despite their separation.

Richard was also, famously, their childhood tennis coach.
Smith portrays Richard while newcomers Demi Singleton and Saniyya Sidney play Serena and Venus, respectively.Recalling how their mother, Oracene Price, was the backbone of the family early on in the siblings' tennis careers, Serena tells Smith about the time their father quit his job to solely focus on being a coach.
My dad at one point was working and then, he stopped," she says.
He's like, 'This is what we're going to do.
I'm not going to have a job.
I'm gonna go with Venus and Serena, and train them every day.'
Now that would be impossible for me if my husband [Alexis Ohanian] were to tell me that.

I'm trying to relax a little bit,' " says the mom of one, imagining what her reaction would be if Ohanian suddenly stopped working.
But she had to support seven people, as a family of seven," Serena notes looking at her mom who was also seated around the red table with Smith and her daughters Isha and Lyndrea Price, who are Serena and Venus' half-sisters.
Eldest half-sister Yetunde Price was tragically killed in 2003.
Crediting the matriarch, Serena says neither she nor Venus would be the successful athletes they are today without their mom.
To have that faith and to have that back end support, we wouldn't have survived without that," she shares.Will Smith Gave Cash Bonuses to HisKing RichardCostars: 'I Couldn't Believe It'Price, who is portrayed in the biopic by actress Aunjanue Ellis, was also Serena and Venus' coach and helped the pair win 149 titles, including 44 Grand Slams and four Olympic gold medals.
They had goals in mind.
I saw them working so hard, and they never ever complained," Price toldTodayin 2019 about her daughters' work ethic.
It was a lot of naysayers saying that they're not gonna make it, but I never thought they wouldn't.
