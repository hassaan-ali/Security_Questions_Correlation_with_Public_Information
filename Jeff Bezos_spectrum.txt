He was high schoolvaledictorian, aNational Merit Scholar,[34][35]and aSilver Knight Awardwinner in 1982.[34]In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind wouldcolonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park".[36]In 1986, he graduatedsumma cum laudefromPrinceton Universitywith a 4.2GPAand aBachelor of Science in Engineeringdegree (B.S.E.) inelectrical engineeringandcomputer science; he was also a member ofPhi Beta Kappa.[37][38]While at Princeton, Bezos was a member of theQuadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[39]In addition, he was elected toTau Beta Piand was the president of the Princeton chapter of theStudents for the Exploration and Development of Space(SEDS).[40][41]Business careerEarly careerAfter Bezos graduated from college in 1986, he was offered jobs atIntel,Bell Labs, andAndersen Consulting, among others.[42]He first worked at Fitel, afintechtelecommunicationsstart-up, where he was tasked with building a network forinternational trade.[43]Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter. He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager atBankers Trustfrom 1988 to 1990. He then joinedD. E. Shaw & Co, a newly createdhedge fundwith a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling from 1990 until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president by age 30.[44][42]AmazonMain article:AmazonBezos (front row, center) at the Robot Co-op in 2005In late 1993, Bezos read that the Internet was growing at a rate of 2300% a year and decided to establish anonline bookstore.[45]He and his then-wife,MacKenzie Scott, left their jobs at D. E. Shaw and founded Amazon in a rented garage inBellevue, Washington on July 5, 1994, after writing itsbusiness planon a cross-country drive from New York City toSeattle.[46][47]With Bezos at the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company's first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially.[48]Prior to settling on Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at anIndian reservationnearSan Franciscoin order to avoid paying taxes.[49]Bezos initially named his new companyCadabrabut later changed the name toAmazonafter theAmazon Riverin South America, in part because the name begins with the letterA, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[50]At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with "A" would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches.[51]In addition, he regarded "Amazon," the name of the world's largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world's largest online bookstore.[51]He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents as investment in Amazon.[47][52][53]He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[54]Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[44][50]Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with aninitial public offering(IPO).[55]In response to critical reports fromFortuneandBarron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such asBordersandBarnes & Noble.[50]In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company's products to include a variety of otherconsumer goods.[50]Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company's 1997equity offeringto finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[50]In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350 million.[56]In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launchAmazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels andwebsite traffic.[50]In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[57]After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[56]In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400 million.[58][failed verification]In November 2007, Bezos launched theAmazon Kindle.[59]According to a 2008Timeprofile, Bezos wished to create a device that allowed a "flow state" in reading similar to the experience of video games.[60]In 2013, Bezos secured a $600-million contract with theCentral Intelligence Agency(CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[61]In October of that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[62]Bezos in 2010In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[63]On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7 million.[64]A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[65]By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109 billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular,Blue Origin.[66]On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon'sSuper Bowl commercial.[67]On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterlyearningsof $2 billion.[68]Due to the growth ofAlibabain China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon intoIndia.[69]On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became theworld's wealthiest personoverMicrosoftco-founderBill Gateswhen his estimatednet worthincreased to just over $90 billion. His wealth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world byForbeson March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112 billion.[70]Bezos receives theJames Smithson Bicentennialmedal on June 14, 2016, for his work with Amazon.[71]In March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon's global senior vice president, to India with $5.5 billion to localize operations throughout the company'ssupply chainroutes.[72]Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon and Bezos, specifically ofsales taxavoidance, misusingpostal routes, andanti-competitivebusiness practices.[73]Amazon's share price fell by 9% in response to the President's negative comments; this reduced Bezos's personal wealth by $10.7 billion.[74]Weeks later, Bezos recouped his losses when academic reports out ofStanford Universityindicated that Trump could do little to regulate Amazon in any meaningful way.[75]During July 2018, a number of members of the U.S. Congress called on Bezos to detail the applications of Amazon'sface recognitionsoftware,Rekognition.[76]Bezos on October 25, 2017, on his visit toLos Angeles Air Force Base.[77]Criticism of Amazon's business practices continued in September 2018 when SenatorBernie Sandersintroduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receivingcorporate welfare.[78]This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers inArizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers inPennsylvaniaandOhio, relied on food stamps.[79]While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: "Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?"[80]He later said: "Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America."[81]Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary "misleading" as it included part-time workers.[82]However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[83]On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[84]The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour, a decision that was interpreted as support for theFight for $15movement.[85]In February 2021, Bezos announced that in thethird quarterof 2021 he would step down from his role as CEO of Amazon to become the Executive Chairman of the Amazon Board. He was succeeded as CEO byAndy Jassy.[86][87][88]On February 2, 2021, Bezos sent an email[89]to all Amazon employees, telling them the transition would give him "the time and energy [he] need[s] to focus on theDay 1 Fund, theBezos Earth Fund,Blue Origin,The Washington Post, and [his] other passions."[90]Blue OriginMain article:Blue OriginBezos andRob Meyerson(fifth from left) giving NASA Deputy AdministratorLori Garver(fourth from left) a tour of Blue Origin's crew capsule in 2011U.S. Secretary of DefenseAsh Cartermeets with Bezos in 2016 atThe Pentagon.In September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, ahuman spaceflightstartup.[91]Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel and the development of human life in the Solar System.[35]His 1982 high schoolvaledictoriansenior graduation speech was followed up with aMiami Heraldinterview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for human beings who were in orbit.[92]The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse throughresource depletion.[93]Rob Meyersonled Blue Origin from 2003 to 2017 and served as its first president.[94]After its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006 when it purchased a large tract of land inWest Texasfor a launch and test facility.[95]After the company gained the public's attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing thecost of space travelfor humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[96]In September 2011, one of the company's uncrewed prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight. Although the crash was viewed as a setback, news outlets noted how far the company went from its founding-to-date in advancingspaceflight.[97]After the crash, Bezos has been superstitiously wearing his "lucky" TexasCowboy bootsto all rocket launches.[98]In May 2013, Bezos met withRichard Branson, chairman ofVirgin Galactic, to discuss commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies.[99]He has been compared to Branson andElon Muskas all three are billionaires who prioritize spaceflight among their business interests.[100]In 2015, Bezos announced that a neworbital launch vehiclewas under development and would make its first flight in the late-2010s.[101]Later in November, Blue Origin'sNew Shepardspace vehicle successfully rocketed into space and reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers) before executing avertical landingback at the launch site in West Texas.

That $250,000 investment resulted in 3.3 million shares of Google stock, worth about $3.1 billion in 2017.[120][121]He also invested inUnity Biotechnology, a life-extension research firm hoping to slow or stop the process of aging.[122]Bezos is involved in the healthcare sector, which includes investments in Unity Biotechnology,GRAIL,Juno Therapeutics, andZocdoc.[123]In January 2018, an announcement was made concerning Bezos's role within a new, unnamed healthcare company. This venture, later namedHaven, is expected to be a partnership between Amazon,JPMorgan, andBerkshire Hathaway.[124][125]Bezos also supports philanthropic efforts through direct donations and non-profit projects funded by Bezos Expeditions.[126]Bezos used Bezos Expeditions to fund several philanthropic projects, including an Innovation center at the Seattle Museum of History and Industry and the Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics atPrinceton Neuroscience Institute.[127][128]In 2013, Bezos Expeditions funded the recovery of twoSaturn Vfirst-stageRocketdyne F-1engines from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.[129]They were positively identified as belonging to theApollo 11mission'sS-1C stagefrom July 1969.[130][131]The engines are currently on display at theSeattle Museum of Flight.[132][133]Altos LabsMain article:Altos LabsIn September 2021, Bezos co-founded Altos Labs withMail.rufounderYuri Milner.

Bezos was a multi-billionaire who drove a 1996Honda Accord.[139]Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[140][141][142]Bezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[143][144]This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman, who described him as "talking in lists" and "[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made."[140]Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrotea bookthat described Bezos as a demanding boss as well ashyper-competitive,[136][143]and opined that Bezos perhaps "bet the biggest on the Internet" than anyone else.[145]Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles andexternalities.[146][147]During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to weartailored clothing; heweight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[148]His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as themetonymof the company.[149][150]His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has beenparodiedas an enterprisingsupervillain.[151][152][153]Since 2017, he has been portrayed byKyle MooneyandSteve CarellonSaturday Night Live, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure.[154][better source needed]In May 2014, theInternational Trade Union Confederationnamed Bezos the "World's Worst Boss", with its general secretarySharan Burrowsaying: "Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model",[155]while in 2019,Harvard Business Review, which ranked Bezos the best-performing CEO for 4 years in a row since 2014, did not rank him even in the top 100, citing Amazon's "relatively low ESG (environment,social, andgovernance) scores" that reflect "risks created byworking conditionsand employment policies,data security, andantitrustissues."[156]During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses.[27]His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016.[157][27]Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing aNew York Timespiece.[158][159]Leadership style"Day 1" Management PhilosophyDay 1:start upDay 2:stasisDay 3:irrelevanceDay 4: "excruciating, painful decline"Day 5:deathBezos has stated "it is always Day 1" to describe hisgrowth mindset.[160][161]Bezos used what he called a "regret-minimization framework" while he worked atD. E. Shawand again during the early years of Amazon. He described thislife philosophyby stating: "When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes."[162]During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.[38]To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed themantra"Get Big Fast", establishing the company's need toscaleits operations to produce market dominance.[50]He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form ofdividends.[140]Bezos uses the term "work–life harmony" instead of the more standard "work–life balance" because he believes thatbalanceimplies that you can only have one and not the other. He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other.[163]JournalistWalt Mossbergdubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique shouldn't do anything new or interesting "The Bezos Principle".[164]Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule—a preference that meetings are small enough for twopizzasto feed everyone in the boardroom.[165]When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon, he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise thecommon standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.[166]In 2018, it was reported that he met with Amazon investors for just six hours a year.[165]Instead of usingpresentation slides, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives.[167]Since 1998, Bezos has published an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers, not competitors; take risks formarket leadership; facilitate staff morale; build acompany culture; and empower people.[168][169]Bezos maintains the email address jeff@amazon.com[170]as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company.

Bezos says that Narrative Structure is best suited for communication and persuasion. In a crunch situation, between data and a story, Bezos would believe the story.My first tryst with persuasion using a story happened when i was five years old. My grandmother used to feed me a mixture of rice and lentils cooked in a pressure cooker. The concoction would then get a generous dose of clarified butter. The dish called "Khichdi" would be laid piping hot on the table. In my gluttonous hurry, I would often scald my hand as i prodded my fingers into the middle of the molten khichdi. The tantrum that followed would be vexing for my grandmother. One day, my grandmother said "Let me tell you a story by which you will learn how to eat Khichdi the right way"Grandma narrated- Much of Northern India was ruled by the Nanda kings in the 3rd century BC. They were evil and tyrannised the population. Chanakya, a wise Brahmin could-not bear to see the kingdom going to waste. He groomed a young, brave boy named Chandragupta to take on the Nanda Kings. As days passed, the boy grew stronger and wanted to attack the capital of the Nanda Kings but Chanakya advised him that attacking the heart of the empire would mean certain defeat. They should start attacking the peripheral villages and conquer them one by one thus steadily encircling the Nanda Kings. This strategy worked and Chandragupta went on to form the great Maurya Empire.My grandmother said “If you try to eat the Khichdi from the centre you will burn yourself, if you start from the sides and go all around you will enjoy it whilst it is still hot without scalding yourself”. This was my primer in strategy and problem solving. A problem has to be broken into parts and thus is easier to solve. A low hanging fruit should be grabbed first which paves way for bigger success.The Science behind a StoryStories are engaging and allow complex concepts to be explained in a simple way. Stories have the capability to inspire and connect with emotions thus leading to deeper and sustainable change. According to Stanford Graduate school of business, stories are 22 times more memorable than facts alone. A powerful sales communication tool, stories can capture attention, build trust and credibility and deliver messages and insights with impact. Neuroscience imaging proves that facts and figures activate just two areas of the brain; those responsible for language comprehension and processing. In contrast, stories activate up to eight areas of the brain; those having to do with touch, movement, colour, sound, scent and shape in addition to language comprehension and processing. This implies that the brain responds to the story events as if they are actually happening to the listener. This concept is called "Transportation". At high levels of transportation, the story may even seem like a real experience to the reader. A well told story has a hypnotic effect and often like a beautiful movie has the power to make you laugh and cry.Secondly, the human brain has a strong tendency to disengage quickly and start day dreaming. In the presence of a compelling story however the brain snaps to attention due to the release of stress hormones known as cortisol.If you are a Sales person, remember! “We don’t buy products, we buy stories”- When a customer comes to buy a mattress for his bad back, he expects the sales person to tell him stories about real people with back problems who are sleeping soundly on the mattress.“Every Story is about Change” Change by overcoming a fearStory Telling is an art as well as a science.Learn the science and practice the art.The 3S PrincipleIt is important that when you share your story it follows the 3S principle. Structure Substance StyleStructureStructure consists of a theme or a plot which you can summarise in one line. Structure starts with a message that you want the audience to take home, for example, Change or Perish!, A movie example could be –In the pursuit of Happyness. The Hero struggles to find an alternative career and wins in the end after successfully learning a new skill. Think Different!- The Greatest Showman, The Hero thinks out of the box to create a novel experience for the audience and becomes successful. A simple structure for a story is “Hero-Goal-Obstacles-Change”According to mythologist Joseph Campbell, all stories have a meta structure consisting of three major acts; Departure, Initiation and Return.Departure: Here the Protagonist is living an ordinary life and receives a call to go to adventure, he is ambivalent but receives guidance and divine powers from a mentorInitiation: The Protagonist undergoes mini trials and setbacks before he meets the villain and in an epic struggle defeats it consequently winning an elixir that can change the world.Return: The transformed Protagonist albeit reluctant to return, goes back to his ordinary world with the elixir and benefits the world.Movies like the Star Wars, Kungfu Panda and many others are based on this meta structure.SubstanceSubstance means; Characters, Events, a Time line, Conflict and Climax. The story should have rich characters, this can be done by assigning names, personality, back grounds etc. You could show case the characters intentions and motivations. The most important aspect of a story is conflict, it may be between characters or the protagonist may be facing a personal conflict. Ensure that your audience knows clearly what the conflict is, it could be Good vs Evil, New vs Old. To ensure coherence for the audience, setting your story along a time line is important. The climax should be like the Magicians Reveal, Creating an Aha!. Tease the audience by revealing things slowly. Creating surprises keeps the audience engaged.StyleStyle is to use the right body language, voice modulation and subtle dramatisation. Taking up space to share your story is important. Believe in your story and aim to inspire the audience with your passion. The audience is more receptive when you are able to make them feel that what you are saying is authentic and has happened to real people. Share a personal story to create rapport or connect with the audience.Business StoriesStory Telling is not just about sharing elaborate stories Most often Business Story Telling is about short anecdotes, referring to real people, their common problems and how they overcame a situation.Imagine you are the CEO of a car company presenting your strategy to the Board and you are saying “We now produce electric cars made through a Joint Venture with Krome.”A story way of sharing the information could be.– Our car sales were falling dramatically. As you know young kids all over the world care dearly about the environment. They do-not want cars that pollute. My 18 year old daughter, Jessica, doesn’t even want a driving license, would you believe that!. We decided to transform and looked at interested companies that care for the environment. Finding the right partner was the biggest challenge. Then we found Krome. They had the desire, money and the digital knowledge to support our Mobility expertise. Our Electric cars are going to be the best in the world.This story has a Beginning- Our Sales were falling.Characters- Young People including Jessica who is a real person.The Characters Motivation- Save the Planet, leading to Behaviour- Boycott Fossil fuel cars.Conflict/Dilemma- We are car makers, what do we do?Climax- Struggle to Find, the Knight in Shining Armour.End- Change for Good, Manufacture Electric Cars.Move away from a Product/Service worldview to a Person world view. Understand that when you shift the perspective the view shifts dramatically. Story Telling is as old as humanity and is ingrained in our DNA.

He Adopted Me When I Was 4'ByAvie SchneiderPublished July 28, 2020 at 7:07 PM CDTFacebookTwitterLinkedInEmailMandel Ngan/AFP via Getty ImagesAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos is set to testify Wednesday before a House antitrust panel along with the chiefs of Apple, Facebook and Google.The CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google areset to testifybefore a House antitrust subcommittee Wednesday about whether their companies have too much power.For Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, it will be his first appearance before Congress. He begins hisprepared remarkswith a personal story, as he often does in public appearances:I'm Jeff Bezos. I founded Amazon 26 years ago with the long-term mission of making it Earth's most customer-centric company.My mom, Jackie, had me when she was a 17-year-old high school student in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Being pregnant in high school was not popular in Albuquerque in 1964. It was difficult for her. When they tried to kick her out of school, my grandfather went to bat for her. After some negotiation, the principal said, "OK, she can stay and finish high school, but she can't do any extracurricular activities, and she can't have a locker." My grandfather took the deal, and my mother finished high school, though she wasn't allowed to walk across the stage with her classmates to get her diploma. Determined to keep up with her education, she enrolled in night school, picking classes led by professors who would let her bring an infant to class. She would show up with two duffel bags—one full of textbooks, and one packed with diapers, bottles, and anything that would keep me interested and quiet for a few minutes.My dad's name is Miguel. He adopted me when I was four years old. He was 16 when he came to the United States from Cuba as part of Operation Pedro Pan, shortly after Castro took over. My dad arrived in America alone. His parents felt he'd be safer here. His mom imagined America would be cold, so she made him a jacket sewn entirely out of cleaning cloths, the only material they had on hand. We still have that jacket; it hangs in my parents' dining room. My dad spent two weeks at Camp Matecumbe, a refugee center in Florida, before being moved to a Catholic mission in Wilmington, Delaware. He was lucky to get to the mission, but even so, he didn't speak English and didn't have an easy path. What he did have was a lot of grit and determination. He received a scholarship to college in Albuquerque, which is where he met my mom. You get different gifts in life, and one of my great gifts is my mom and dad. They have been incredible role models for me and my siblings our entire lives.You learn different things from your grandparents than you do from your parents, and I had the opportunity to spend my summers from ages four to 16 on my grandparents' ranch in Texas. My grandfather was a civil servant and a rancher—he worked on space technology and missile-defense systems in the 1950s and '60s for the Atomic Energy Commission—and he was self-reliant and resourceful. When you're in the middle of nowhere, you don't pick up a phone and call somebody when something breaks. You fix it yourself. As a kid, I got to see him solve many seemingly unsolvable problems himself, whether he was restoring a broken-down Caterpillar bulldozer or doing his own veterinary work. He taught me that you can take on hard problems. When you have a setback, you get back up and try again. You can invent your way to a better place.I took these lessons to heart as a teenager, and became a garage inventor. I invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker out of an umbrella and tinfoil, and alarms made from baking pans to entrap my siblings.The concept for Amazon came to me in 1994. The idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles — something that simply couldn't exist in the physical world — was exciting to me. At the time, I was working at an investment firm in New York City. When I told my boss I was leaving, he took me on a long walk in Central Park. After a lot of listening, he finally said, "You know what, Jeff, I think this is a good idea, but it would be a better idea for somebody who didn't already have a good job." He convinced me to think about it for two days before making a final decision. It was a decision I made with my heart and not my head. When I'm 80 and reflecting back, I want to have minimized the number of regrets that I have in my life. And most of our regrets are acts of omission—the things we didn't try, the paths untraveled. Those are the things that haunt us. And I decided that if I didn't at least give it my best shot, I was going to regret not trying to participate in this thing called the internet that I thought was going to be a big deal.The initial start-up capital for Amazon.com came primarily from my parents, who invested a large fraction of their life savings in something they didn't understand. They weren't making a bet on Amazon or the concept of a bookstore on the internet. They were making a bet on their son.

He was born to a teenaged mother, who married Cuban immigrant Miguel Bezos when he was four years old.That time on the ranch is where his grandfather taught him about self-reliance, everything from how to fix equipment to how to care for a sick cow, Bezos said. And he learned lots of life lessons he carries with him today, he said.Bezos' remarks came during anon-stage interview with Mathias Döpfner, the CEO of Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company. The interview was part of an awards event in Berlin hosted by Business Insider's US editor-in-chief, Alyson Shontell.During those days on the ranch, his grandfather also dispensed plenty of words of wisdom, he said.One major example came when Bezos was 10 years old. This was in 1974, when there was a big public health movement to get people to stop smoking, and anti-smoking commercials were airing constantly."One of the advertisements had this figure in it," Bezos recalled on stage. "It said something like 'every puff of a cigarette takes so many minutes off your life. I can’t remember, I think it was 2 minutes."Bezos knew his grandmother was a chain smoker."So I sat at the back of this car ride and calculated how many minutes she had taken off her life. In my 10-year-old-mind, I had been extremely clever to do this. When I finished with my arithmetic, I proudly announced to her how many years she had taken off her life," he said.Story continuesHer response was to burst into tears. Bezos was shocked and surprised, never expecting that reaction."So my grandfather stopped the car and he took me out," Bezos remembers."And I had no idea what was going to happen because he had never said a cross word to me. And I thought, he might actually be angry with me," he said.But he wasn’t. His grandfather simply wanted to talk to him in privacy.And his grandfather said, "You are going to figure out one day, that’s it's harder to be kind than to be clever."Bezos never forgot that story or that wisdom.And it explains a lot about Amazon because some would say the culture at his company can sometimes be more clever than kind.While Amazon is often kind to its customers -- it is obsessive about great customer service -- the company has the reputation that its focus on employee productivity and meeting data-driven targets can makeAmazon a hard, sometimes even cruel place to work.Amazon workers tell stories ofpeeing in bottles in the warehouse, because the bathroom was too from the work floor and their output was so carefully measured, they were afraid using attending to their body's needs would cause them to miss their work targets. They also tell of getting penalized for talking to their coworkers."The metrics are brutally aggressive, and most of my colleagues are in a state of constant anxiety that we could be fired at any moment for not meeting metrics," one current US warehouse employee recently told Business Insider reporter Shona Ghosh.On the other hand, while Bezos is the first to admit that Amazon measures everything in detail, he has also recently said that the true key to running a business is listening to people, particularly customers."The thing I have noticed is when the anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right. There's something wrong with the way you are measuring it,"he recently explained.NOW WATCH:Jeff Bezos reveals what it's like to build an empire and become the richest man in the world — and why he's willing to spend $1 billion a year to fund the most important mission of his lifeSee Also:The Jeff Bezos approach to handling criticism is a good rule everyone should followJeff Bezos reveals what it's like to build an empire and become the richest man in the world — and why he's willing to spend $1 billion a year to fund the most important mission of his lifeWatch Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, and other famous tech CEOs transform from children to adults in these creepy, mesmerizing animationsSEE ALSO:Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos explains his famous one-character emails, known to strike fear in managers' heartsRecommended StoriesSheKnowsDonald Trump Reportedly Made This Very Specific Plea to Melania Following His ArrestDonald Trump needs some help, and he doesn’t want to do it alone.

He was high schoolvaledictorian, aNational Merit Scholar,[34][35]and aSilver Knight Awardwinner in 1982.[34]In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind wouldcolonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park".[36]In 1986, he graduatedsumma cum laudefromPrinceton Universitywith a 4.2GPAand aBachelor of Science in Engineeringdegree (B.S.E.) inelectrical engineeringandcomputer science; he was also a member ofPhi Beta Kappa.[37][38]While at Princeton, Bezos was a member of theQuadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[39]In addition, he was elected toTau Beta Piand was the president of the Princeton chapter of theStudents for the Exploration and Development of Space(SEDS).[40][41]Business careerEarly careerAfter Bezos graduated from college in 1986, he was offered jobs atIntel,Bell Labs, andAndersen Consulting, among others.[42]He first worked at Fitel, afintechtelecommunicationsstart-up, where he was tasked with building a network forinternational trade.[43]Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter.

E. Shaw and founded Amazon in a rented garage inBellevue, Washington on July 5, 1994, after writing itsbusiness planon a cross-country drive from New York City toSeattle.[46][47]With Bezos at the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company's first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially.[48]Prior to settling on Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at anIndian reservationnearSan Franciscoin order to avoid paying taxes.[49]Bezos initially named his new companyCadabrabut later changed the name toAmazonafter theAmazon Riverin South America, in part because the name begins with the letterA, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[50]At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with "A" would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches.[51]In addition, he regarded "Amazon," the name of the world's largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world's largest online bookstore.[51]He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents as investment in Amazon.[47][52][53]He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[54]Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[44][50]Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with aninitial public offering(IPO).[55]In response to critical reports fromFortuneandBarron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such asBordersandBarnes & Noble.[50]In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company's products to include a variety of otherconsumer goods.[50]Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company's 1997equity offeringto finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[50]In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350 million.[56]In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launchAmazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels andwebsite traffic.[50]In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[57]After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[56]In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400 million.[58][failed verification]In November 2007, Bezos launched theAmazon Kindle.[59]According to a 2008Timeprofile, Bezos wished to create a device that allowed a "flow state" in reading similar to the experience of video games.[60]In 2013, Bezos secured a $600-million contract with theCentral Intelligence Agency(CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[61]In October of that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[62]Bezos in 2010In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[63]On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7 million.[64]A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[65]By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109 billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular,Blue Origin.[66]On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon'sSuper Bowl commercial.[67]On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterlyearningsof $2 billion.[68]Due to the growth ofAlibabain China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon intoIndia.[69]On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became theworld's wealthiest personoverMicrosoftco-founderBill Gateswhen his estimatednet worthincreased to just over $90 billion.

If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America."[81]Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary "misleading" as it included part-time workers.[82]However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[83]On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[84]The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour, a decision that was interpreted as support for theFight for $15movement.[85]In February 2021, Bezos announced that in thethird quarterof 2021 he would step down from his role as CEO of Amazon to become the Executive Chairman of the Amazon Board. He was succeeded as CEO byAndy Jassy.[86][87][88]On February 2, 2021, Bezos sent an email[89]to all Amazon employees, telling them the transition would give him "the time and energy [he] need[s] to focus on theDay 1 Fund, theBezos Earth Fund,Blue Origin,The Washington Post, and [his] other passions."[90]Blue OriginMain article:Blue OriginBezos andRob Meyerson(fifth from left) giving NASA Deputy AdministratorLori Garver(fourth from left) a tour of Blue Origin's crew capsule in 2011U.S. Secretary of DefenseAsh Cartermeets with Bezos in 2016 atThe Pentagon.In September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, ahuman spaceflightstartup.[91]Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel and the development of human life in the Solar System.[35]His 1982 high schoolvaledictoriansenior graduation speech was followed up with aMiami Heraldinterview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for human beings who were in orbit.[92]The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse throughresource depletion.[93]Rob Meyersonled Blue Origin from 2003 to 2017 and served as its first president.[94]After its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006 when it purchased a large tract of land inWest Texasfor a launch and test facility.[95]After the company gained the public's attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing thecost of space travelfor humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[96]In September 2011, one of the company's uncrewed prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight. Although the crash was viewed as a setback, news outlets noted how far the company went from its founding-to-date in advancingspaceflight.[97]After the crash, Bezos has been superstitiously wearing his "lucky" TexasCowboy bootsto all rocket launches.[98]In May 2013, Bezos met withRichard Branson, chairman ofVirgin Galactic, to discuss commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies.[99]He has been compared to Branson andElon Muskas all three are billionaires who prioritize spaceflight among their business interests.[100]In 2015, Bezos announced that a neworbital launch vehiclewas under development and would make its first flight in the late-2010s.[101]Later in November, Blue Origin'sNew Shepardspace vehicle successfully rocketed into space and reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers) before executing avertical landingback at the launch site in West Texas.

This venture, later namedHaven, is expected to be a partnership between Amazon,JPMorgan, andBerkshire Hathaway.[124][125]Bezos also supports philanthropic efforts through direct donations and non-profit projects funded by Bezos Expeditions.[126]Bezos used Bezos Expeditions to fund several philanthropic projects, including an Innovation center at the Seattle Museum of History and Industry and the Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics atPrinceton Neuroscience Institute.[127][128]In 2013, Bezos Expeditions funded the recovery of twoSaturn Vfirst-stageRocketdyne F-1engines from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.[129]They were positively identified as belonging to theApollo 11mission'sS-1C stagefrom July 1969.[130][131]The engines are currently on display at theSeattle Museum of Flight.[132][133]Altos LabsMain article:Altos LabsIn September 2021, Bezos co-founded Altos Labs withMail.rufounderYuri Milner.

Bezos was a multi-billionaire who drove a 1996Honda Accord.[139]Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[140][141][142]Bezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[143][144]This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman, who described him as "talking in lists" and "[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made."[140]Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrotea bookthat described Bezos as a demanding boss as well ashyper-competitive,[136][143]and opined that Bezos perhaps "bet the biggest on the Internet" than anyone else.[145]Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles andexternalities.[146][147]During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to weartailored clothing; heweight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[148]His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as themetonymof the company.[149][150]His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has beenparodiedas an enterprisingsupervillain.[151][152][153]Since 2017, he has been portrayed byKyle MooneyandSteve CarellonSaturday Night Live, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure.[154][better source needed]In May 2014, theInternational Trade Union Confederationnamed Bezos the "World's Worst Boss", with its general secretarySharan Burrowsaying: "Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model",[155]while in 2019,Harvard Business Review, which ranked Bezos the best-performing CEO for 4 years in a row since 2014, did not rank him even in the top 100, citing Amazon's "relatively low ESG (environment,social, andgovernance) scores" that reflect "risks created byworking conditionsand employment policies,data security, andantitrustissues."[156]During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses.[27]His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016.[157][27]Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing aNew York Timespiece.[158][159]Leadership style"Day 1" Management PhilosophyDay 1:start upDay 2:stasisDay 3:irrelevanceDay 4: "excruciating, painful decline"Day 5:deathBezos has stated "it is always Day 1" to describe hisgrowth mindset.[160][161]Bezos used what he called a "regret-minimization framework" while he worked atD. E. Shawand again during the early years of Amazon. He described thislife philosophyby stating: "When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes."[162]During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.[38]To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed themantra"Get Big Fast", establishing the company's need toscaleits operations to produce market dominance.[50]He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form ofdividends.[140]Bezos uses the term "work–life harmony" instead of the more standard "work–life balance" because he believes thatbalanceimplies that you can only have one and not the other. He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other.[163]JournalistWalt Mossbergdubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique shouldn't do anything new or interesting "The Bezos Principle".[164]Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule—a preference that meetings are small enough for twopizzasto feed everyone in the boardroom.[165]When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon, he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise thecommon standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.[166]In 2018, it was reported that he met with Amazon investors for just six hours a year.[165]Instead of usingpresentation slides, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives.[167]Since 1998, Bezos has published an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers, not competitors; take risks formarket leadership; facilitate staff morale; build acompany culture; and empower people.[168][169]Bezos maintains the email address jeff@amazon.com[170]as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company.

The Princeton student stands to inherit around $50 billion.bySCMPPreston Bezos, right, is billionaire and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ eldest child ... so what is he like? Photo: Getty ImagesJeff Bezos is widely credited for pioneering the e-commerce landscape. The meteoric rise and success of Amazon catapulted Bezos to become the world’s first centibillionaire in 2018, the first individual to hold a net worth of US$100 billion. According to Forbes, his real-time net worth is valued at US$157 billion at the time of writing.The entrepreneur’s billionaire status has undoubtedly thrust him into the limelight, yet his Instagram account, where he shares personal titbits about his parents, siblings and girlfriend Lauren Sánchez, shows no photos of his children.Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott were married from 1993 to 2019. Photo: @SunSentinel/ TwitterHe shares three boys and one adopted daughter from China with ex-wife and novelist MacKenzie Scott. Little is known about them and they are very elusive, according to reports. His eldest Preston is about 22 now, but the names of the other two sons, believed to be teenagers, and the adopted daughter, remain unknown.As the firstborn, Preston may inherit Amazon and his parents’ billions someday. So what do we know about him?Preston Bezos and a university friend. Photo: @skyewcalifornia/TwitterHe reportedly attends Princeton UniversityPreston was born in 2000 and attends Princeton University – the same university that his father graduated from in 1986 – according to British media. He was also named after his father’s middle name, Jeffrey Preston Bezos.Jeff Bezos and his son Preston at the American Portrait Gala, in 2019. Photo: @smithsoniannpg/TwitterHe learned ‘resourcefulness’ from a young ageIn 2017, speaking at the Summit Series in Los Angeles, Jeff shared a surprising method on raising successful children, giving a unique peek into how Preston was brought up. He said he let his kids play with sharp knives and power tools at a young age. He added that, by letting kids take risks and be self-reliant, it teaches them resourcefulness – an important trait in business and daily life. Erm, sure, we’ll take your word for it,Jeff…Not many know that Jeff Bezos shares four kids with ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott. Photo: @exploritat/TwitterPreston bonds with dad Jeff every morningWhile he is no longer the CEO of Amazon (though he’s still an executive chairman), Jeff still runs other ventures, making him very busy: he is the founder of aerospace company Blue Origin and the owner of The Washington Post.But his days are not rushed. He makes a point to allot time for his kids – including Preston. He mentions he “putters” once he gets up. “I like to read the newspaper, I like to have coffee, I like to have breakfast with my kids before they go to school,” Bezos explained at the Economic Club of Washington DC, in 2018.Preston and Jeff Bezos attending the Oscars in 2020. Photo: @Pop Crave/TwitterHe’s becoming more publicly visiblePreston and Jeff attended theOscarsin 2020 asAmazon’sFrench film, Les Misérables, scored a nomination under the best international feature category.At the ceremony, Chris Rock joked how Jeff was still the richest man in the world despite being divorced. “He saw Marriage Story and thought it was a comedy,” Rock said. Jeff was seen laughing with Preston.Preston was also spotted in public in June. He and his siblings went out for a family dinner with Jeff and his partner Sánchez, at Nobu in Los Angeles, Hola! reported.Jeff Bezos and his son Preston attend the 2019 American Portrait Gala at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in November 2019, in Washington DC. Photo: Getty ImagesA hefty inheritance?If Jeff and Scott decided to consolidate their current net worths of US$157 billion and US$39 billion respectively, as per Forbes and divide it evenly among their kids, Preston’s inheritance would be at a conservative estimate of US$49 billion.However, his inheritance may change as it factors only Jeff and MScott’s current wealth. It may increase as his parents could become even wealthier in the future.Note:This story was originally published onSCMPand has been republished on this website.Tags from the storyAmazon,Billionaires,Jeff-Bezos,SCMPYou may also likeOctober 30, 2022A closer look at George Clooney’s insanely luxurious lifestyle – The megastar has a $1 billion tequila empire and loves to splurge on properties with his gorgeous wife Amal Clooney.

He begins hisprepared remarkswith a personal story, as he often does in public appearances:I'm Jeff Bezos. I founded Amazon 26 years ago with the long-term mission of making it Earth's most customer-centric company.My mom, Jackie, had me when she was a 17-year-old high school student in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Being pregnant in high school was not popular in Albuquerque in 1964. It was difficult for her. When they tried to kick her out of school, my grandfather went to bat for her. After some negotiation, the principal said, "OK, she can stay and finish high school, but she can't do any extracurricular activities, and she can't have a locker." My grandfather took the deal, and my mother finished high school, though she wasn't allowed to walk across the stage with her classmates to get her diploma. Determined to keep up with her education, she enrolled in night school, picking classes led by professors who would let her bring an infant to class. She would show up with two duffel bags—one full of textbooks, and one packed with diapers, bottles, and anything that would keep me interested and quiet for a few minutes.My dad's name is Miguel. He adopted me when I was four years old. He was 16 when he came to the United States from Cuba as part of Operation Pedro Pan, shortly after Castro took over. My dad arrived in America alone. His parents felt he'd be safer here. His mom imagined America would be cold, so she made him a jacket sewn entirely out of cleaning cloths, the only material they had on hand. We still have that jacket; it hangs in my parents' dining room. My dad spent two weeks at Camp Matecumbe, a refugee center in Florida, before being moved to a Catholic mission in Wilmington, Delaware. He was lucky to get to the mission, but even so, he didn't speak English and didn't have an easy path. What he did have was a lot of grit and determination. He received a scholarship to college in Albuquerque, which is where he met my mom. You get different gifts in life, and one of my great gifts is my mom and dad. They have been incredible role models for me and my siblings our entire lives.You learn different things from your grandparents than you do from your parents, and I had the opportunity to spend my summers from ages four to 16 on my grandparents' ranch in Texas. My grandfather was a civil servant and a rancher—he worked on space technology and missile-defense systems in the 1950s and '60s for the Atomic Energy Commission—and he was self-reliant and resourceful. When you're in the middle of nowhere, you don't pick up a phone and call somebody when something breaks. You fix it yourself. As a kid, I got to see him solve many seemingly unsolvable problems himself, whether he was restoring a broken-down Caterpillar bulldozer or doing his own veterinary work. He taught me that you can take on hard problems. When you have a setback, you get back up and try again. You can invent your way to a better place.I took these lessons to heart as a teenager, and became a garage inventor. I invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker out of an umbrella and tinfoil, and alarms made from baking pans to entrap my siblings.The concept for Amazon came to me in 1994. The idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles — something that simply couldn't exist in the physical world — was exciting to me. At the time, I was working at an investment firm in New York City. When I told my boss I was leaving, he took me on a long walk in Central Park. After a lot of listening, he finally said, "You know what, Jeff, I think this is a good idea, but it would be a better idea for somebody who didn't already have a good job." He convinced me to think about it for two days before making a final decision. It was a decision I made with my heart and not my head. When I'm 80 and reflecting back, I want to have minimized the number of regrets that I have in my life. And most of our regrets are acts of omission—the things we didn't try, the paths untraveled. Those are the things that haunt us. And I decided that if I didn't at least give it my best shot, I was going to regret not trying to participate in this thing called the internet that I thought was going to be a big deal.The initial start-up capital for Amazon.com came primarily from my parents, who invested a large fraction of their life savings in something they didn't understand. They weren't making a bet on Amazon or the concept of a bookstore on the internet. They were making a bet on their son. I told them that I thought there was a 70% chance they would lose their investment, and they did it anyway. ...TechnologyWATCH: Heads Of Amazon, Apple, Facebook And Google Testify On Big Tech's PowerRead Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' written testimony in full.Read Apple CEO Tim Cook's written testimony.Read Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's written testimony.Read Google CEO Sundar Pichai's s written testimony.Editor's note:Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook are among NPR's financial supporters.Jeff BezosAmazonFacebookFlipboardEmailRead & ListenHomeNewsCultureMusicPodcasts & ShowsConnectNewslettersFacebookInstagramPressContact & HelpAbout NPROverviewDiversityAccessibilityEthicsFinancesPublic EditorCorrectionsGet InvolvedSupport Public RadioSponsor NPRNPR CareersNPR ShopNPR EventsNPR ExtraTerms of UsePrivacyYour Privacy ChoicesText OnlySponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

The school is being launched by a nonprofit organization called Bezos Academy.The school will open for in-person classes on Oct. 19, said the Day 1 Academies Fund, which is overseen by the Day One Fund. The single-room school is planned to accommodate about a dozen students, ages 3 to 5 years old, and will be open year-round, five days a week, the organization said.The Day 1 Academies Fund said the school will follow coronavirus safety measures outlined by Washington state officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Child care and early learning programs remain open in Washington state.Enrollment at the school is currently underway, the Day 1 Academies Fund said. An Amazon spokesperson declined to say how many schools Bezos Academy plans to open.Bezos first unveiled hisplan to launcha network of "Montessori-inspired" preschools in September 2018. The schools are built in low-income communities and designed for underserved children, offering them access to free programs.Montessori schools emphasize hands-on and self-directed learning, with uninterrupted blocks of working time, in mixed-age classrooms. Bezos is a product of a Montessori education, along withGooglefounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.At the time of the announcement, Bezos said he wanted to run the schools using Amazon's own principles, namely, customer obsession. "The child will be the customer," he added.Bezos launched the Day One Fund with a $2 billion commitment in September 2018, with the goal of launching preschools under the Day 1 Academies Fund and helping homeless families under the Day 1 Families Fund.The Day One Fund has been closely watched since its announcement two years ago. As CEO of Amazon, founder of rocket company Blue Origin and owner of The Washington Post, Bezos is the richest man in the world, with a net worth of at least $176 billion. In August, his wealthbriefly crossed $200 billion, making him the first person to cross that threshold.watch nowVIDEO5:2205:22Amazon will 'take over the world' from Walmart and keep growing: AnalystSquawk Box AsiaSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesSelect ShoppingClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

This one in Des Moines, WA, is the first of many free preschools that we’ll be opening for underserved children.”The preschool will have a year-round curriculum, five days a week, for children 3-5 years old. According to the Bezos Day Onewebsite, the team selected to put the preschool in Des Moines, a town to the south of Seattle based on income levels, rates of participation in free and reduced-cost meal programs, gaps in access to license childcare providers, and buy-in from local businesses who will support the growth of the preschool. It will continue to use this kind of data set for choosing locations to other schools.Bezos first announced his intention to build a network of preschools in November 2018, when he launched the $2 billion Bezos Day One Fund. The fund has two priorities: giving to nonprofits that are helping homeless families, and building a network of preschools. Since its launch, the fund has given around $100 milliona yearto a variety of homeless-focused nonprofits. The Amazon founder has remained relatively quiet about the schools initiative, until today.The schools will be inspired by Montessori, a method of education where curriculums are more hands-on, collaborative, and change based on the individual student’s own interests. Bezos attended a Montessori school when he was 2 years old in Albuquerque, New Mexico. “You know, intuitively, I think it was probably a very formative experience for me to be able to go to those classes, in that environment, and be so stimulated at an early age,” BezostoldMontessori Lifemagazine in a 2000 interview. “I don’t actually know what the scientific research shows, but intuitively I have to imagine that it’s good for little kids.” In the same interview, Bezos recalled “tracing out letters on sandpaper” and “painting on a big easel.”The network of preschools will operate under the parent nonprofit organization, also called Bezos Academy. The group is in the process of hiring for a position that will  assess the success or failures of the preschool program.Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Send me a securetip.Angel Au-YeungEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions
KUOW - Everett is the latest community to open a Bezos-funded free preschoolSkip to main contentNews & StoriesLocalEverett is the latest community to open a Bezos-funded free preschoolDiana OpongMarch 13, 2023/2:41 pm1 of 3Bezos Academy Preschool Everett - Downtown locationBassetti ArchitectsA new tuition-free Montessori-inspired preschool is open in downtown Everett, backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. It’s calledBezos Academy.The school offers year-round Montessori-inspired education to children ages 3-5 years old, five days a week."As with all of our schools, this one has been nearly a couple of years in the making. So it takes us a while between when we first have a conversation with an organization, in this case the city of Everett that was excited to bring a full-day tuition-free preschool to the community," said Katie Ford, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer for Bezos Academy.Located downtown at Everett Station, the tuition-free learning center opened its doors on March 2, 2023. It serves about 54 students. The new school takes up about 3,800 square feet, where they have three classrooms that can accommodate 20 students each.Such schools are open in under-resourced communities, but admissions eligibility isn’t just determined by family income."We give preference to children who are in foster care or whose families are experiencing homelessness; about 13% of our enrolled students are in that category," says Ford.Teaching time is from 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. During that time preschoolers are exposed to a mix of music, art, and playtime, but that’s not all.“We do everything from hiring and training the teachers to providing breakfast and lunch snacks," Ford said. "And for families who want it, we'll send dinner home as well." The program also includes before and aftercare, which allows students to be on-site from 8am-5pm.Ford said the academy's program is designed to serve students who come from families who earn up to 400% of the federal poverty level. For a family of four, that's about $110,000 a year.Families can apply for a lottery to attend a new school, but there’s a waitlist for students interested in joining midway through the academic year.All available slots are currently full at the Everett station school, however, families can sign up to join the waitlist at BezosAcademy.org.The academy has already opened a handful oflocations in Western Washington, including schools Des Moines, Federal Way, Kent, Pacific Beach, Renton, and two in Tacoma. A location in Pasco also opened in early 2023. A few more schools are currently in the works, including sites Centralia, Kent, and SeaTac."We hope we'll be able to open before the end of this calendar year," Ford said.March marks the opening of the first schools outside of Washington state. Bezos Academy will be opening its first school Orlando, Florida, and Houston, Texas.Story fromKUOW NewsroomRead more abouteducationJeff Bezosschools and educationWhy you can trust KUOWDiana OpongProducer/Announcer/ReporterDiana Opong serves in many roles at KUOW.

The City of Houston announced the 10-year lease agreement with Bezos Academy on Wednesday for a Montessori-inspired preschool in the Denver Harbor area.The Houston City Council approved a ten-year lease agreement for a 4,967 square-foot building space and an additional 6,345 square-foot outdoor space located in the Denver Harbor Multi-Service Center at 6402 Market Street. The school will operate year-round, five days a week, for children 3-5 years old and will feature two classrooms, according to a Wednesday news release."When we look for partners to host Bezos Academy preschools, we try to find opportunities that meet more than just the educational needs of the child," said Mike George, Bezos Academy president, in the release. "The City of Houston helped us identify a site at Denver Harbor that will situate our tuition-free preschool in the midst of residential support programs for families ranging from a food pantry to health education. We couldn’t be more excited to join and support this community."Admission to the academy is based on a lottery and eligibility is determined by household income. Families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty limit with children aged 3-4 are eligible. Families that are interested can apply on the academy'ssiteonce the school's opening date is set.Mayor Sylvester Turnerin the release called the partnership a "game-changer" for low-income families.

Bezos is shopping for a lucky (?) city where he plans to invest $5 billion and create 50,000 high-paying jobs. But even if we did get the nod, why would we want to be squashed like an Amazon package dropped from a truck on Highway 101?As our family station wagon rolled down Evergreen Point Road in the tiny Seattle suburb of Medina (pronounced “Me-dye-na”), past Bezos’s hidden five-acre estate, I knew security cameras were peering at us at each intersection. I’d been warned that we would likely be stopped and questioned by police if we dared to venture into the tiny town, an easy commute to corporate mecca Bellevue, just across Lake Washington from Seattle. But I was curious what kind of a neighborhood a man worth $130 billion would choose as home turf.No one paid the slightest attention to us. Woodsy Medina reminded me a lot of Hope Ranch. Fellow billionaire Bill Gates lives about a half mile away from Bezos, but you can’t see his $125 million compound from the road, either. I wondered if the two tech bosses bumped into one another while strolling around the neighborhood.Bezos? Where’d that name come from? How’d a genuine all-American billionaire get that name? Cuba, actually. For those who have no use for immigrants, here’s a story to ponder while prying open the Amazon box on your front porch. It goes back to a pregnant 16-year-old high school girl in Albuquerque, New Mexico. As soon as Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen was born, Jacklyn Gise divorced her husband, Ted Jorgensen, who then split.Gise soon wed immigrant (take that, you haters) Miguel “Mike” Bezos, who only a few years before had arrived from Cuba at 15, alone, broke and reportedly knowing only one word of English: “hamburger.”Mike adopted Jeff, then 4. Turned out that Mike was one smart cookie and a heck of a father, and he went on to earn an engineering degree at the University of New Mexico. Jeff was a bright, innovative kid who rigged up an alarm system to keep his younger siblings out of his room. In high school, he worked the McDonald’s breakfast shift. After making Phi Beta Kappa at Princeton, Jeff went to work in Manhattan. During a coast-to-coast driving trip to Seattle, he famously cranked out the business plan that led to Amazon and polished it off in his garage.The corporate Amazon already has something of a presence in Santa Barbara, including its ownership of Whole Foods, Amazon@IslaVista pickup location, and acquisition last year of S.B. start-up Graphiq (formerly FindTheBest) to work on its Alexa virtual assistant. I think Bezos would find friends here, if he hasn’t already. This isn’t exactly Trump Country, and the president has no use for the owner of theWashington Post, a critic of all things Trumpery.Bezos, visit all you want; just don’t bring the whole Amazon package.Add to FavoritesTue Apr 11, 2023 | 23:47pmhttps://www.independent.com/2018/06/07/visiting-street-where-amazons-jeff-bezos-lives/More Like ThisChaucer’s Books Presents ‘Where Yellow Flowers Bloom’ Book Signing with Kim CantinFree Will AstrologyThe Echoes of the Civil War in Santa BarbaraRecent NewsTop StoriesNOAA Identifies Eight Possible Sites for Fish Farming in Santa Barbara ChannelEnvironmentByCallie Fausey| Tue Apr 11, 2023 | 3:54pmCancer Cluster Ruled out at Dos Pueblos High SchoolHealthByCallie Fausey| Tue Apr 11, 2023 | 1:15pmLompoc’s Request to Build on Prime Ag Land Along Bailey Avenue DeniedHousingByJean Yamamura| Tue Apr 11, 2023 | 12:26pm[Update] Highway 154 Closed Due to Two AccidentsPublic SafetyByJean Yamamura| Mon Apr 10, 2023 | 2:52pm‘Lights!

It was there that Bezos first debuted the Amazon websiteon July 16, 1995as an online bookstore.In 2019, thatpiece of internet historysold for roughly $1.5 million, according toZillow.A property listing for a three-bedroom house at 10704 NE 28th Street in Bellevue, Washington billed the home as "the birthplace of Amazon."Take a look inside."Jeff Bezos started Amazon in the garage in the 1990's!" reads the listing from real estate agent Pat Sullivan of John L. Scott Real Estate.Source: John L.

Shaw and founded Amazon in a rented garage inBellevue, Washington on July 5, 1994, after writing itsbusiness planon a cross-country drive from New York City toSeattle.[46][47]With Bezos at the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company's first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially.[48]Prior to settling on Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at anIndian reservationnearSan Franciscoin order to avoid paying taxes.[49]Bezos initially named his new companyCadabrabut later changed the name toAmazonafter theAmazon Riverin South America, in part because the name begins with the letterA, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[50]At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with "A" would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches.[51]In addition, he regarded "Amazon," the name of the world's largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world's largest online bookstore.[51]He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents as investment in Amazon.[47][52][53]He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[54]Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[44][50]Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with aninitial public offering(IPO).[55]In response to critical reports fromFortuneandBarron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such asBordersandBarnes & Noble.[50]In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company's products to include a variety of otherconsumer goods.[50]Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company's 1997equity offeringto finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[50]In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350 million.[56]In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launchAmazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels andwebsite traffic.[50]In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[57]After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[56]In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400 million.[58][failed verification]In November 2007, Bezos launched theAmazon Kindle.[59]According to a 2008Timeprofile, Bezos wished to create a device that allowed a "flow state" in reading similar to the experience of video games.[60]In 2013, Bezos secured a $600-million contract with theCentral Intelligence Agency(CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[61]In October of that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[62]Bezos in 2010In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[63]On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7 million.[64]A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[65]By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109 billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular,Blue Origin.[66]On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon'sSuper Bowl commercial.[67]On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterlyearningsof $2 billion.[68]Due to the growth ofAlibabain China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon intoIndia.[69]On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became theworld's wealthiest personoverMicrosoftco-founderBill Gateswhen his estimatednet worthincreased to just over $90 billion. His wealth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world byForbeson March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112 billion.[70]Bezos receives theJames Smithson Bicentennialmedal on June 14, 2016, for his work with Amazon.[71]In March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon's global senior vice president, to India with $5.5 billion to localize operations throughout the company'ssupply chainroutes.[72]Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon and Bezos, specifically ofsales taxavoidance, misusingpostal routes, andanti-competitivebusiness practices.[73]Amazon's share price fell by 9% in response to the President's negative comments; this reduced Bezos's personal wealth by $10.7 billion.[74]Weeks later, Bezos recouped his losses when academic reports out ofStanford Universityindicated that Trump could do little to regulate Amazon in any meaningful way.[75]During July 2018, a number of members of the U.S. Congress called on Bezos to detail the applications of Amazon'sface recognitionsoftware,Rekognition.[76]Bezos on October 25, 2017, on his visit toLos Angeles Air Force Base.[77]Criticism of Amazon's business practices continued in September 2018 when SenatorBernie Sandersintroduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receivingcorporate welfare.[78]This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers inArizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers inPennsylvaniaandOhio, relied on food stamps.[79]While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: "Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?"[80]He later said: "Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America."[81]Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary "misleading" as it included part-time workers.[82]However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[83]On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[84]The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour, a decision that was interpreted as support for theFight for $15movement.[85]In February 2021, Bezos announced that in thethird quarterof 2021 he would step down from his role as CEO of Amazon to become the Executive Chairman of the Amazon Board. He was succeeded as CEO byAndy Jassy.[86][87][88]On February 2, 2021, Bezos sent an email[89]to all Amazon employees, telling them the transition would give him "the time and energy [he] need[s] to focus on theDay 1 Fund, theBezos Earth Fund,Blue Origin,The Washington Post, and [his] other passions."[90]Blue OriginMain article:Blue OriginBezos andRob Meyerson(fifth from left) giving NASA Deputy AdministratorLori Garver(fourth from left) a tour of Blue Origin's crew capsule in 2011U.S. Secretary of DefenseAsh Cartermeets with Bezos in 2016 atThe Pentagon.In September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, ahuman spaceflightstartup.[91]Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel and the development of human life in the Solar System.[35]His 1982 high schoolvaledictoriansenior graduation speech was followed up with aMiami Heraldinterview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for human beings who were in orbit.[92]The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse throughresource depletion.[93]Rob Meyersonled Blue Origin from 2003 to 2017 and served as its first president.[94]After its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006 when it purchased a large tract of land inWest Texasfor a launch and test facility.[95]After the company gained the public's attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing thecost of space travelfor humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[96]In September 2011, one of the company's uncrewed prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight. Although the crash was viewed as a setback, news outlets noted how far the company went from its founding-to-date in advancingspaceflight.[97]After the crash, Bezos has been superstitiously wearing his "lucky" TexasCowboy bootsto all rocket launches.[98]In May 2013, Bezos met withRichard Branson, chairman ofVirgin Galactic, to discuss commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies.[99]He has been compared to Branson andElon Muskas all three are billionaires who prioritize spaceflight among their business interests.[100]In 2015, Bezos announced that a neworbital launch vehiclewas under development and would make its first flight in the late-2010s.[101]Later in November, Blue Origin'sNew Shepardspace vehicle successfully rocketed into space and reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers) before executing avertical landingback at the launch site in West Texas. In 2016, Bezos allowed select journalists to visit, tour, and photograph his facility.[102]He has repeatedly called for increased inter-space energy and industrial manufacturing to decrease the negative costs associated withbusiness-related pollution.[103]In December 2017, New Shepard successfully flew and landeddummy passengers, amending and pushing its human space travel start date into late 2018.[104]To execute this program, Blue Origin built six of the vehicles to support all phases of testing and operations: no-passenger test flights, flights with test passengers, and commercial-passenger weekly operations.[105]Since 2016, Bezos has spoken more freely about his hopes tocolonize the solar system, and has been selling US$1 billion in Amazon stock each year to capitalize Blue Origin in an effort to support this endeavor.[106][107]In May 2018, Bezos maintained that the primary goal of Blue Origin is to preserve thenatural resources of Earthby making the human speciesmulti-planetary.[108]He announced thatNew Shepardwould begin transporting humans intosub-orbital spaceby November 2018.[108]In July 2018, it was announced that Bezos had priced commercial spaceflight tickets from $200,000 to $300,000 per person.[109]On July 20, 2021, he launched on theNS-16mission with his half-brother Mark Bezos,Wally Funk, andOliver Daemen.[110]He launched nine days afterRichard Bransonlaunched onboard theVirgin Galactic Unity 22mission.

Bezos was a multi-billionaire who drove a 1996Honda Accord.[139]Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[140][141][142]Bezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[143][144]This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman, who described him as "talking in lists" and "[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made."[140]Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrotea bookthat described Bezos as a demanding boss as well ashyper-competitive,[136][143]and opined that Bezos perhaps "bet the biggest on the Internet" than anyone else.[145]Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles andexternalities.[146][147]During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to weartailored clothing; heweight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[148]His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as themetonymof the company.[149][150]His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has beenparodiedas an enterprisingsupervillain.[151][152][153]Since 2017, he has been portrayed byKyle MooneyandSteve CarellonSaturday Night Live, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure.[154][better source needed]In May 2014, theInternational Trade Union Confederationnamed Bezos the "World's Worst Boss", with its general secretarySharan Burrowsaying: "Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model",[155]while in 2019,Harvard Business Review, which ranked Bezos the best-performing CEO for 4 years in a row since 2014, did not rank him even in the top 100, citing Amazon's "relatively low ESG (environment,social, andgovernance) scores" that reflect "risks created byworking conditionsand employment policies,data security, andantitrustissues."[156]During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses.[27]His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016.[157][27]Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing aNew York Timespiece.[158][159]Leadership style"Day 1" Management PhilosophyDay 1:start upDay 2:stasisDay 3:irrelevanceDay 4: "excruciating, painful decline"Day 5:deathBezos has stated "it is always Day 1" to describe hisgrowth mindset.[160][161]Bezos used what he called a "regret-minimization framework" while he worked atD. E. Shawand again during the early years of Amazon. He described thislife philosophyby stating: "When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes."[162]During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.[38]To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed themantra"Get Big Fast", establishing the company's need toscaleits operations to produce market dominance.[50]He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form ofdividends.[140]Bezos uses the term "work–life harmony" instead of the more standard "work–life balance" because he believes thatbalanceimplies that you can only have one and not the other. He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other.[163]JournalistWalt Mossbergdubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique shouldn't do anything new or interesting "The Bezos Principle".[164]Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule—a preference that meetings are small enough for twopizzasto feed everyone in the boardroom.[165]When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon, he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise thecommon standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.[166]In 2018, it was reported that he met with Amazon investors for just six hours a year.[165]Instead of usingpresentation slides, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives.[167]Since 1998, Bezos has published an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers, not competitors; take risks formarket leadership; facilitate staff morale; build acompany culture; and empower people.[168][169]Bezos maintains the email address jeff@amazon.com[170]as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company. Although he does not respond to the emails, he forwards some of them with a question mark in the subject line to executives who attempt to address the issues.[171]Bezos has citedJeff ImmeltofNew Enterprise Associates,[172]Warren BuffettofBerkshire Hathaway,Jamie DimonofJPMorgan Chase, andBob IgerofThe Walt Disney Companyas major influences on his leadership style.[172][173]RecognitionIn 1999, Bezos received his first major award whenTimenamed himPerson of the Year.[174]In 2008, he was selected byU.S. News & World Reportas one of America's best leaders.[175]Bezos was awarded an honorary doctorate in science and technology fromCarnegie Mellon Universityin 2008.[176]In 2011,The Economistgave Bezos and Gregg Zehr an Innovation Award for theAmazon Kindle.[177]In 2012, Bezos was named Businessperson of the Year byFortune.[178]He is also a member of theBilderberg Groupand attended the 2011 Bilderberg conference inSt. Moritz, Switzerland,[179]and the2013 conferenceinWatford, Hertfordshire, England.

However, Bezos would keep all of the couple's voting rights.[262]He is the Honorary Chair of theExplorers Club.[263]PoliticsIndian Prime MinisterNarendra Modipresenting the USIBC Global Leadership Award to Bezos, in Washington, D.C. on June 7, 2016British Prime MinisterBoris Johnsonmeets with Bezos during the United Nations General Assembly, in New York City on September 20, 2021.According to publiccampaign finance records, Bezos supported the electoral campaigns ofPatty MurrayandMaria Cantwell, twoDemocraticU.S. senators from Washington.

According to BBC, Bezos's top security staffer,Gavin de Becker,[283]"linked the hack to theWashington Post's coverage of the murder of Saudi writerJamal Khashoggiat the Saudi consulate in Istanbul". Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and dissident was employed as a writer at theWashington Post, owned by Bezos. Khashoggi was killed in late 2018, in Turkey's Saudi consulate for his critical stance and journalism against the Saudi government and its leader.[284]In January 2020,The Guardianreported that the hack was initiated before the murder but after Khashoggi wrote critically about the crown prince in theWashington Post. Forensic analysis of Bezos's mobile phone conducted by advisory firmFTI Consulting, concluded it "highly probable" that the hack was achieved using a malicious file hidden in a video sent in aWhatsAppmessage to Bezos from the personal account of the crown prince on May 1, 2018.[285][286]Saudi Arabia has denied the claim.[287]PhilanthropyBezos funded the retrieval of theseF-1 engineparts from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean in 2015, eventually donating them to theSeattle Museum of Flight.

When he was designated the "world wealthiest person" on March 6, 2018, theForbesThe World's Billionaireslist stipulated that although Bezos was the firstcenti-billionaire(i.e. +US$100 billion in net worth), it wasBill Gateswho had the most money when taken inreal terms.[220]In such terms, Gates had $150 billion while Bezos had $100 billion. However, in July 2018, the net worth of Bezos officially surpassed the $150 billion mark, which led most major wealth indexes to label him the wealthiest person in modern history (post-1982).[221]References^Jonge, Peter de (March 14, 1999)."Riding the Wild, Perilous Waters of Amazone.com".The New York Times.ISSN0362-4331.

According toThe Wall Street Journal, Bezos bought the nine-acre property for $165 million from billionaire David Geffen. It's the most expensive home ever sold in the Los Angeles area.It's unknown how Bezos' properties were divided afterhis divorce from MacKenzie Bezoswas finalized in July 2019. Everything acquired throughout the marriage from real estate to incomeis considered joint propertyin the Bezos' home state of Washington, as Insider's Tanza Loudenback previously reported. Amazon did not respond to Insider's request for comment on how the properties were divided after the divorce.Bezos remainsthe richest person in the worldwith an estimated net worth of $188 billion, while MacKenzie Bezos is now worth over $57 billion, making her one of the richest women in the world. In February 2020, Bezos announced he was stepping down from his role as CEO of Amazon to become the company's executive chairman.From two neighboring Beverly Hills mansions to a sprawling estate in an exclusive Seattle suburb, here are all the residential properties Bezos is known to own in the US.Caroline Cakebread contributed to an early version of this article.Jeff Bezos has spent millions of dollars amassing a collection of residential properties over the years.Jeff Bezos threw his weight behind the US military.AP Photo/Pablo Martinez MonsivaisA 2017 Land Report named the Amazon CEOthe country's 28th-largest landowner.Over the years, he's picked up several New York City apartments, a ranch in Texas, and homes in Washington state, California, and Washington, DC.Before Bezos' divorce was finalized in July 2019, these properties also belonged to his wife MacKenzie Bezos, as all real estate acquired throughout a marriage isconsidered joint propertyin the Bezos' home state of Washington. (They weremarried in 1993.)Although Bezos made at least one major real-estate purchase after his divorce was announced, it's unknown how the properties were divided after the couple split up. Amazon did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the matter.In June 2019, two months after the couple announced their divorce, the former Amazon CEO reportedly dropped about $80 million on three adjacent New York City apartments.Bezos bought a penthouse and two additional units at 212 Fifth Avenue.Marketing by VisualhouseThe spread includeda three-story penthouse and two units directly below it.It was thepriciest real-estate deal south of 42nd Streetin New York, appraiser Jonathan Miller told The Wall Street Journal.Renderings of the inside of the apartment from creative agency VisualHouse show the opulence of the penthouse.Marketing by VisualhouseThe apartments have 12 bedrooms in total and span 17,000 square feet of living space.Bezos' home base is a nearly 29,000-square-foot estate in Medina, Washington.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderBezos' two homes in Medina span about 5.3 acres.According to theWall Street Journal, he paid $10 million for the property in 1998. One home is a 20,600-square-foot, five-bedroom, four-bathroom house, and the other is an 8,300-square-foot, five-bedroom, four-bathroom home rumored to have cost $53 million.Medina, located on a peninsula just across Lake Washington from Seattle, is an exclusive suburb that's also home to Bill Gates, as well as other Microsoft bigwigs, tech entrepreneurs, and telecom magnates.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderMany ofthe neighborhood's mansions are hidden away behind gatesand protected by elaborate security systems.Bezos' estate underwent a $28 million renovation in 2010.A home in Medina.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderThe home, which sits right on the shores of Lake Washington, includes310 feet of private shoreline and a boathouse.Bezos also owns property in Beverly Hills, California, one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Los Angeles.Shutterstock/Zhukova ValentynaBezos bought this Spanish-style mansion in 2007 for $24.45 million.Dream Homes MagazineThe seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom Beverly Hills home is advertised byDream Homes Magazineas having a greenhouse, a sunken and lighted tennis court, a huge swimming pool, four fountains, and a six-car garage. The street is a hotspot for Hollywood stars, and is said to have been home to Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed and Walter Matthau.Ten years later, Bezos bought a smaller house next door.Google EarthApparently,the first Beverly Hills housedid not fit Bezos' space requirements. In 2017,he bought a comparatively modest four-bedroom, 4,568-square-foot home for $12.9 million right next door to his first house. As you can see in the above picture, Bezos' property dominates the mansion-filled block.His most recent Beverly Hills purchase, as reported by The Wall Street Journal in 2020, is the Warner Estate.Google EarthThe Warner Estate, according toThe Wall Street Journal, was designed for Jack Warner — the former president of Warner Bros. Studios — in the 1930s. Bezos reportedly bought the home from billionaire David Geffen, who bought it back in1990 for $47.5 million.According to The Wall Street Journal, Bezos bought the nine-acre property for a whopping $165 million, making it the most expensive home ever sold in Los Angeles.A Google Maps satellite view of the Jack Warner Estate.Google MapsOn February 12, The Wall Street Journal alsoreportedthat Bezos Expeditions — which manages Bezos' venture capital investments — bought a plot of undeveloped land in Los Angeles for $90 million. It is believed to be an investment.Bezos also owns a 30,000-acre ranch about 30 miles from the town of Van Horn, Texas.Shutterstock/Lynda LehmannBezos grew up spending summers on his grandparents' ranchoutside of Cotulla, Texas and bought the 30,000-acre Figure 2 ranch to give his family the same experience.Bezos bought the 30,000-acre property after the seller spent "millions" renovating it.Google EarthThe U-shaped ranch house seen above is a remnant from the seller,who reportedly put "millions" into renovating it. Behind the home is a bunkhouse that sleeps 12.The property is also the base for Bezos' private space company, Blue Origin.Blue OriginBlue Origin made history in 2015when it successfully launched and landed the reusable rocket, New Shepard. Its goal is to become a space tourism company, ferrying passengers up for weightless ridesas soon as April 2019.The former Amazon CEO can also call the US capital home as of 2016.Orhan Cam/ShutterstockIn 2016, Bezos bought a former textile museum in Washington, DC for $23 million.Getty ImagesThe27,000-square-foot space in DC's Kalorama neighborhoodis a former textile museum and dates back to 1912, earning it a spot on the National Register of Historic Places.The neighborhood, Kalorama, is a hot spot for Washington big wigs.Getty ImagesThe Obamas own a $5.3 million home nearby, and Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner recently moved in right down the street.The two joint structures on the property have nearly 27,000 square feet of living space, making it the largest home in Washington, DC.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderBezos is said to be spending $12 million to renovatethe homes and the surrounding property.In January 2020, a source told The Washington that Bezos had also bought the four-bedroom home across the street.Google MapsThe brick house went on the market for just under $5 million in December 2019 andsold less than a month later, according to the The Washingtonian.The publication suggests that the former Amazon CEO may have picked up the neighboring property to protect his privacy, as the home had a direct view into his mansion across the street.An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment on Bezos' rumored purchase of the home.Bezos' $80 million purchase of New York City real estate in 2019 was not his first buy in the Big Apple.Stig Ottesen/UnsplashHis purchase at 212 Fifth in 2019 predated a company announcement. In December 2019, Amazon announced plans to opena new 1,500-employee office in New York City, less than a year afterscrapping its plans to build its second headquarters in the city.But Bezos had owned other residences in the city as far back as 1999,according to the New York Observer.He bought three condos in a historic Manhattan building overlooking Central Park for $7.65 million in 1999.David Shankbone/Wikipedia CommonsIn 1999,the New York Observer reported, Bezos bought three apartments in the Century building at25 Central Park Westin the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattanunder an LLC called "Jetima."He purchasedthe apartmentsfrom former Sony Music head Tommy Mottola for $7.65 million.The 32-story Art Deco building was built in 1931and boasts a concierge, elevator attendants, and three separate entrances, as well as a prime location right next to Central Park.Bezos bought an additional unit at 25 Central Park West in 2012. But he apparently does not currently own property there.City RealtyBezos bought an additional unit at 25 Central Park West for $5.3 million in 2012, making him the owner offour condos in the historic building.However, a Bezos spokesman said he doesn't own these properties.

Working out of his garage with a handful of employees, Bezos began developing the software for the site, which he calledAmazon.com. It sold its first book in 1995.Where was Jeff Bezos born?Jeff Bezos was born inAlbuquerque,New Mexico, on January 12, 1964. He was raised largely in Houston, Texas, and moved to Miami, Florida, as a teenager.Was Jeff Bezos born rich?Jeff Bezos was not born into a wealthy family. His parents were 17 and 18 years old when he was born, and he worked on his maternal grandparents’ ranch in Cotulla,Texas, early in his life. He graduated summa cum laude fromPrinceton Universityin 1986, with degrees in electricalengineeringandcomputer science.What was Jeff Bezos’s first job?As a teenager, Jeff Bezos got his first job at aMcDonald’srestaurant, where he was a fry cook.

Under his guidance, Amazon became the largest retailer on theWorld Wide Weband the model forInternetsales.Early life and careerJeff BezosWhile still inhigh school, Bezos developed the Dream Institute, a centre that promoted creative thinking in young students. After graduating (1986) summa cum laude fromPrinceton Universitywith degrees in electrical engineering andcomputer science, he undertook a series of jobs before joining theNew Yorkinvestment bankD.E. Shaw & Co. in 1990. Soon named senior vice president—the firm’s youngest—Bezos was in charge of examining theinvestmentpossibilities of the Internet. Its enormous potential—Web usage was growing by more than 2,000 percent a year—sparked his entrepreneurial imagination. In 1994 he quit D.E. Shaw and moved toSeattle, Washington, to open a virtual bookstore. Working out of his garage with a handful of employees, Bezos began developing the software for the site. Named after the South American river, Amazon sold its first book in July 1995.Amazon.comJeff BezosAmazon quickly became the leader in e-commerce. Open 24 hours a day, the site was user-friendly, encouraging browsers to post their own reviews of books and offering discounts, personalized recommendations, and searches for out-of-print books. In June 1998 it began selling CDs, and later that year it added videos. In 1999 Bezos added auctions to the site andinvestedin other virtual stores. The success of Amazon encouraged other retailers, including major book chains, to establish online stores.As more companies battled for Internet dollars, Bezos saw the need to diversify, and by 2005 Amazon offered a vast array of products, including consumer electronics, apparel, and hardware. Amazon diversified even further in 2006 by introducingAmazon Web Services(AWS), acloud-computingservice that eventually became the largest such service in the world. In late 2007 Amazon released a new handheld reading device called theKindle, a digital book reader with wireless Internet connectivity, enabling customers to purchase, download, read, and store avastselection of books on demand. Amazon announced in 2010 that sales of Kindle books had surpassed those of hardcover books. That same year Amazon moved into making its own television shows and movies with its Amazon Studios division. Amazon’s yearly net sales increased from $510,000 in 1995 to some $600 million in 1998 and from more than $19.1 billion in 2008 to almost $233 billion in 2018. About half of the company’s operating income in 2018 was derived from AWS. Two years later Amazon registered record profits, and its revenue in the fourth quarter that year surpassed $100 billion for the first time. The unprecedented numbers were, in part, caused by a rise in home shopping during theCOVID-19pandemic.In February 2021 Bezos announced that he would be stepping down as CEO later that year. However, he planned to remain at Amazon as executive chairman.Other activitiesAside from Amazon, Bezos founded a spaceflight company,Blue Origin, in 2000. Blue Origin bought a launch site inTexassoon thereafter and planned to introduce a crewed suborbital spacecraft,New Shepard, in 2018 and an orbitallaunch vehicle, New Glenn, in 2020. Bezos boughtThe Washington Postandaffiliatedpublications for $250 million in 2013. Bezos’s net worth was calculated in 2018 at $112 billion, making him the richest person in the world.Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.Subscribe NowPersonal lifeIn 1993 Bezos married Mackenzie Tuttle, whom he had met at D.E.

And today,“Page Six” reportedthat the happy couple was third-wheeled by none other than Anna Wintour,Vogue’s editor-in-chief.Paparazzi shots show Sanchez and the Amazon CEO exiting the restaurant looking exceptionally satisfied. Wintour, meanwhile, looks flustered. Of course, my question is, what did the world’s most famous fashion editor, the world’s richest man, and the world’s richest man’s girlfriend talk about during their sit down?The possibilities are truly endless. Perhaps it was just a lunch between friends, and the trio simply discussed being rich. Maybe it was fashion related; they could have talked about what Jeff should wear to hisspace conference, or how he can upend Jack Dorsey as the fashion-daddy of the tech world.Or: could it be that the e-commerce mogul and Sanchez — who has been wearing a ginormous diamond for a month now — plan to tie the knot, and wantVogueto have the exclusive?

It left me convinced Bezos' "breakfast octopus" analogy was not an offhand remark, but something that he had deliberately planned.Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, now the richest man in the world, is ripe for dissection.In endless magazine profiles, newspaper articles, blog posts, and books, every episode of the enigmatic Amazon CEO's life is analyzed. Through them, a portrait of Bezos has emerged: intense, intimidating, curious, relentlessly competitive, and with a biting sense of humor.But only one of the hundreds of anecdotes I've read about him captures my imagination. That of the "breakfast octopus."In a 2014Dallas' D Magazineprofile of Matt Rutledge, whosold his daily-deals e-commerce company, Woot, to Amazon for $110 million in 2010, Rutledge shared the story of his first meeting with Bezos after the deal.During the breakfast meeting, Rutledge asked Bezos why he bought the company. Bezosfamously looked down at his plate and said, "You're the octopus that I'm having for breakfast ... When I look at the menu, you're the thing I don't understand, the thing I've never had. I must have the breakfast octopus."On a recent trip to Seattle, I made a pilgrimage toSeattle restaurant Lolato see what the "breakfast octopus" was all about.Lola is located in between South Lake Union, a neighborhood so full of Amazon buildings that locals call it Amazonia, and Pike Place Market, Seattle's most famous landmark after the Space Needle. It's a seven-minute walk from Bezos' office at Day One Tower.GoogleMapsFrom the outside, the restaurant looked somewhere between a casual brunch place to meet with friends and an upscale date night spot.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderIt looked to be very busy at 10:30 AM on the Thursday before Christmas. When I went inside, I was told that it would be a 30 to 45-minute wait. The restaurant was buzzing.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderI had assumed the restaurant would be quiet for breakfast, but it was quickly clear this is not the type of place someone like Bezos would walk in without a reservation.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderSince I was by myself, I thought I might sit at the bar. But even that was completely filled up. Besides, I doubted Bezos would ever take a business lunch at the bar.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderThe hostess told me to wait in the lobby of the adjoining hotel, Hotel Ändra. I decided to read up on Lola. I learned that it was one of the first restaurants of famed chef Tom Douglas. The Mediterranean joint is one of the most enduring and trend-setting restaurants in Seattle's culinary scene.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderSouth Lake Union, or Amazonia, is littered with Tom Douglas establishments. Most of which, like Assembly Hall, Tanakasan, and Brave Horse Tavern, appeared to be tenants of Amazon-owned buildings.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderSource:Tom DouglasThe notorious "breakfast octopus" was the most enticing item on the menu. It was even named "Tom's Favorite Breakfast" after the chef. The waitress said that it and the Eggs Benedict are by far the most popular dishes. Bezos doesn't look like the kind of saucy fellow who would order a Benedict.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderThe dish arrived promptly. It was glorious in its layers of green, yellow, and beige, all topped off with a supple poached egg. But the octopus was nowhere to be found.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderI'll be honest: I was disappointed. I had been expecting a challenge worthy of the mighty Bezos, who had described the dish as "the thing I don't understand." I was expecting a great slab of tentacles, ink, and head.Cegoh/PixabayMy disappointment evaporated as I cut into the dish and tasted the first morsel of "breakfast octopus." The rich, saltiness of the poached yolk contrasted perfectly with the earthy-sweet crunch of the leeks and the firm, charred octopus chunks hiding underneath.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderThe accompanying sourdough bread was toasted to perfection. I dipped it into the garlic Greek yogurt sauce that surrounded the dish. The tangy yet savory yogurt was the only condiment needed. Forget butter, jam, ketchup, and hot sauce.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderAs I made my way through the hearty breakfast, it seemed impossible that Bezos had never ordered it before his breakfast with Rutledge. It's a dish worth returning for again and again.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderHalfway through my breakfast, I channeled my inner-Bezos and innovated. I began piling on each delicate ingredient onto the sourdough to form an open-faced sandwich.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderI took a sip of coffee. The table to my right was talking about vendor agreements, KPIs, a new initiative, and an underperforming colleague. It was a holiday lunch for two mid-level Amazon employees. To my left was a man eating breakfast in front of marked-up Excel spreadsheets. Did everyone work for Amazon?Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderI was in the homestretch of Tom's Favorite Breakfast and though I was getting full, I hadn't tired of the dish. I had just uncovered large tentacles hiding under the potatoes. They too were delicious.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderI would have licked the plate clean if it had not breached the standards of propriety. Given what I knew about Bezos and what I now knew about Lola, I wouldn't be shocked if Bezos anticipated Rutledge's question about why he had bought Woot and either ordered the octopus as an elaborate joke or had prepared the quip beforehand.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderI suppose you don't become worth $98.6 billion by leaving things to chance. Now, I see a clear message in the tale of the breakfast octopus: This is Jeff's world. We're all just living in it.Harrison Jacobs/Business InsiderUpdate: Matt Rutledge, the founder at the meeting with Bezossaid on Twitter he doesn't "support" my reading of the event. Can't win 'em all.Read nextNewsletterTop editors give you the stories you want — delivered right to your inbox each weekday.LoadingSomething is loading.Thanks for signing up!Access your favorite topics in a personalized feed while you're on the go.download the appEmail addressBy clicking ‘Sign up’, you agree to receive marketing emails from Insider

Just in the last year, Amazonacquired Whole Foods, began allowing Amazon Prime membersto watch its movies and TV showson Apple TV,created a camerathat can help you pick out nicer outfits, was granted patents for delivery droneswith wings and legsandmuch more.But back in 1994, when a 30-year-old, newly married Bezos quit his Wall Street job tostart Amazon, the business was pretty simple. It sold books."When we opened our doors, we had 10 employees," Bezos tellstechnology blog GeekWire. "I was driving the packages to the post office myself in my 1987 Chevy Blazer and dreaming one day that we might have a forklift."Only three years later, in 1997,Amazon went publicand Bezos' wealth catapulted to over$12 billion, according to Bloomberg.But you wouldn't have known it by the newly minted billionaire's car. Despite his windfall, Bezos swapped out his 1987 Chevy Blazer for only a modest upgrade — a Honda Accord.That's according to a profile CBS's Bob Simondid of Bezos in 1999for "60 Minutes," recentlyresurfaced by Geekwire, showing Bezos sporting khakis, a button-down and driving the car."What's with the Honda?" Simon asks Bezos.After a laugh, Bezos, who according to The New York Times owned roughly$10 billionin Amazon stock in 1999, responds, "This is a perfectly good car."During the interview, Simon also discovered Amazon's then-headquarters in Seattle shared a street address withpawn shop, a heroin-needle exchange and a "porno parlor." And inside, Bezos' desk was made out of a re-purposed wooden door and two-by-four pieces of wood. In fact, the entire company used desks made of doors as deliberate message,according to the Times.Why so frugal?"It's a symbol of spending money on things that matter to customers and not spending money on things that don't," Bezos explains to Simon.By 2004, Amazon employees werestill using door desks, notes Fast Company. And in 2013, Bezos was still driving a Honda, though a slightly bigger model, according to Brad Stone's book, "The Everything Store."Today, Amazon has a $620 billion market cap and reported$43.7 billionin revenue during its third quarter in 2017 alone, a 34 percent increase from the same quarter in 2016.Bezos has somebigger extravagances, like multiple homes, a private jet and Blue Origin.Yet "frugality" remains one of Amazon'score principlesand the company sticks by Bezos' early mentality. Amazon even gives out an accolade called the "Door Desk Award" to employees who come up with ideas that save money.According to Amazon: "Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention."Don't miss:Mark Cuban says he follows this advice from Jeff Bezos 'to a T'VIDEO2:0902:09Here's the future Jeff Bezos saw for himself at 80, if he didn't found Amazon at 30The Definitive Guide to BusinessLike this story?Like CNBC Make It on Facebook!Stay in the loopGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inboxSign UpAbout UsLearn more about the world of CNBC Make ItLearn MoreFollow UsCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel©2023CNBC LLC.

This electric-powered pooch can run for 90 minutes before recharging and weighs around 55 pounds (25 kg).

He is best known for being the founder, CEO and chairman of leading online retailer Amazon. With a net worth of $130 billion, he is noted as the world’s richest person and the first person to be worth over $100 billion.Will Jeff Bezos bring his dogs to space next?In July 2021, Jeff Bezos flew to space in his ship, Blue Origin, and became one of the first billionaires to fly into space on their own rocket. He launched a second flight in October 2021 withWilliam Shatneras part of the crew on the second manned launch. At 90, Shatner was the oldest person ever aboard a space flight.Now, the only question we have is: Will Jeff Bezoseverbring dogs to space?

Branson’s Virgin Galactic managed heights of 54 miles while Bezos’Blue Origin reached 66 miles. So, if you were going to declare a winner in the epic celebrity space odyssey, you would have to factor in a couple of things. For us, the best celebrity space flight will have to be one with dog astronauts. No question.Who is Jeff Bezos? A Brief HistorySince a young age, Bezos always showed an interesting in science and technology, eventually graduating from Princeton University with Bachelor of Science degrees in computer science and electrical engineering.

His lasting paw print on the company is much greater than anything his parents, Susan and Eric Benson, ever expected.Susan and Eric Benson, with their dog Scout, at their home in Seattle, WA.Photo by JORDAN STEAD / AmazonWhen the couple came to Amazon—Eric as one of the company's first software engineers and Susan as the first managing editor—they were among fewer than 20 employees working out of a former janitorial supply warehouse. Prepared for start-up hours, they asked Jeff Bezos if they could plan to bring Rufus to work. His response, Eric recalls, was, "Is he a good dog?"He was a great dog, and today Amazonowes its remarkable dog-friendly cultureto Rufus. Though he passed away in 2009, his presence is still felt at the Seattle headquarters, where a building bears his name and photos mark his memory.“All dogs are named Rufus”Rufus was already an experienced office hand when he joined Amazon, having worked with Eric and Susan at their previous employer, Netscape. And at the warehouse space in an industrial part of Seattle, having a dog on the premises was no big deal—you could have brought an elephant to work, Susan jokes, and no one would have cared.Photo by JORDAN STEAD / AmazonRufus wore many hats in his time working at Amazon.Photo by JORDAN STEAD / AmazonEven Stephen King was a fan of Rufus.Photo by JORDAN STEAD / AmazonRufus once had his very own photo shoot, and became a central character of Amazon's "404" error page.Photo by JORDAN STEAD / AmazonRufus loved to lie under tables and just hang out.Photo by JORDAN STEAD / AmazonRufus is memorialized in a stone at the Benson's home in Seattle, WA. The stone was a gift to the Bensons from Amazon colleagues who knew and loved Rufus."We did recognize, however, that if we didn't go down in flames, we would move to a larger, better building, and Rufus might not be welcome," Susan says. So, when Amazon drew up contracts with new landlords, they made sure Rufus was written in, too.That fit in with the early spirit at Amazon. "Change was constant, and we were kind of just making up the rules as we went," says Eric, who was building the online store from scratch, while Susan was tasked with creating book recommendations and an editorial tone that would convey human warmth across a glowing screen.As the business grew and moved to offices downtown, the new landlords weren't thrilled about having dogs, as the Bensons had predicted. Their early contract ensured an exception for Rufus, but other employees began sneaking in their dogs too. Email messages went out reminding people that Rufus was the only dog allowed—until one day a former finance executive replied, "From now on, all dogs are named Rufus."That response "was a brilliant moment," Susan says. "It was like a wall falling." When Amazon took up residence at Beacon Hill's Pac Med building in 1998, the company arranged to allow dogs as part of the lease.Rufus leaves quite a paw printRufus launched a number of Amazon sites in his days at work.Photo by JORDAN STEAD / AmazonThe Bensons stayed with Amazon until 2001, with Rufus a constant presence. He was "a serious beggar," Susan says. "He used to work the offices of people who couldn't help themselves" from giving him treats, even though he was on a diet to protect his sensitive gut. And he loved being under a table where people were talking, even if his parents weren't in the room."He would just wander into meetings, sit under the table, and be happy to hang out," Eric says.Rufus also became a fixture at website launches, where he served as the official switch-thrower. "You would hover Rufus over the keyboard and drop his little paw down onto the keyboard to flip the site," Susan says. "It was silly and adorable and people loved it." His appearances in press stories and on Amazon error pages eventually made him a celebrity beyond the office; he began to receive presents from customers and got recognized around town.Life after AmazonAfter leaving Amazon, the Bensons pursued political work, handling tech and web communications for a presidential campaign and, later, working for the U.S. Digital Service. In addition, Susan worked for many years with the Seattle community center Town Hall, sitting on its board and helping to raise funds. The Bensons are also strong supporters of marriage equality and LGBT rights and host the annual Lambda Legal Garden Party."We feel very fortunate to be able to pursue stuff that matters to our hearts," Susan says. "Amazon made that possible for us."During this stretch, Rufus would still go in to "work" from time to time, because a friend who still worked at Amazon would take care of him while the Bensons were away."I think it was a little bit hard on him when we retired," Susan says. "He was happier going to work than doing most other stuff."Still, Rufus got lots of love and dog park time when he wasn't seeing his old friends at Amazon, living to the ripe age of 15. In addition to the Rufus building in South Lake Union,he still has his own page on the websitewherecustomers can also create profilesof their own beloved pets."We were very lucky to have him in our lives," Susan says. "He was a remarkable little guy."Sign up for the Amazon newsletterGet Amazon news delivered to you weekly.Thank you for signing up.Something went wrong, please try again.Please enter a valid email!Sign UpProtected by reCAPTCHA.

His lasting paw print on the company is much greater than anything his parents, Susan and Eric Benson, ever expected.Susan and Eric Benson, with their dog Scout, at their home in Seattle, WA.Photo by JORDAN STEAD / AmazonWhen the couple came to Amazon—Eric as one of the company's first software engineers and Susan as the first managing editor—they were among fewer than 20 employees working out of a former janitorial supply warehouse. Prepared for start-up hours, they asked Jeff Bezos if they could plan to bring Rufus to work. His response, Eric recalls, was, "Is he a good dog?"He was a great dog, and today Amazonowes its remarkable dog-friendly cultureto Rufus. Though he passed away in 2009, his presence is still felt at the Seattle headquarters, where a building bears his name and photos mark his memory.“All dogs are named Rufus”Rufus was already an experienced office hand when he joined Amazon, having worked with Eric and Susan at their previous employer, Netscape. And at the warehouse space in an industrial part of Seattle, having a dog on the premises was no big deal—you could have brought an elephant to work, Susan jokes, and no one would have cared.Photo by JORDAN STEAD / AmazonRufus wore many hats in his time working at Amazon.Photo by JORDAN STEAD / AmazonEven Stephen King was a fan of Rufus.Photo by JORDAN STEAD / AmazonRufus once had his very own photo shoot, and became a central character of Amazon's "404" error page.Photo by JORDAN STEAD / AmazonRufus loved to lie under tables and just hang out.Photo by JORDAN STEAD / AmazonRufus is memorialized in a stone at the Benson's home in Seattle, WA. The stone was a gift to the Bensons from Amazon colleagues who knew and loved Rufus."We did recognize, however, that if we didn't go down in flames, we would move to a larger, better building, and Rufus might not be welcome," Susan says. So, when Amazon drew up contracts with new landlords, they made sure Rufus was written in, too.That fit in with the early spirit at Amazon. "Change was constant, and we were kind of just making up the rules as we went," says Eric, who was building the online store from scratch, while Susan was tasked with creating book recommendations and an editorial tone that would convey human warmth across a glowing screen.As the business grew and moved to offices downtown, the new landlords weren't thrilled about having dogs, as the Bensons had predicted. Their early contract ensured an exception for Rufus, but other employees began sneaking in their dogs too. Email messages went out reminding people that Rufus was the only dog allowed—until one day a former finance executive replied, "From now on, all dogs are named Rufus."That response "was a brilliant moment," Susan says. "It was like a wall falling." When Amazon took up residence at Beacon Hill's Pac Med building in 1998, the company arranged to allow dogs as part of the lease.Rufus leaves quite a paw printRufus launched a number of Amazon sites in his days at work.Photo by JORDAN STEAD / AmazonThe Bensons stayed with Amazon until 2001, with Rufus a constant presence. He was "a serious beggar," Susan says. "He used to work the offices of people who couldn't help themselves" from giving him treats, even though he was on a diet to protect his sensitive gut. And he loved being under a table where people were talking, even if his parents weren't in the room."He would just wander into meetings, sit under the table, and be happy to hang out," Eric says.Rufus also became a fixture at website launches, where he served as the official switch-thrower. "You would hover Rufus over the keyboard and drop his little paw down onto the keyboard to flip the site," Susan says. "It was silly and adorable and people loved it." His appearances in press stories and on Amazon error pages eventually made him a celebrity beyond the office; he began to receive presents from customers and got recognized around town.Life after AmazonAfter leaving Amazon, the Bensons pursued political work, handling tech and web communications for a presidential campaign and, later, working for the U.S. Digital Service. In addition, Susan worked for many years with the Seattle community center Town Hall, sitting on its board and helping to raise funds. The Bensons are also strong supporters of marriage equality and LGBT rights and host the annual Lambda Legal Garden Party."We feel very fortunate to be able to pursue stuff that matters to our hearts," Susan says. "Amazon made that possible for us."During this stretch, Rufus would still go in to "work" from time to time, because a friend who still worked at Amazon would take care of him while the Bensons were away."I think it was a little bit hard on him when we retired," Susan says. "He was happier going to work than doing most other stuff."Still, Rufus got lots of love and dog park time when he wasn't seeing his old friends at Amazon, living to the ripe age of 15. In addition to the Rufus building in South Lake Union,he still has his own page on the websitewherecustomers can also create profilesof their own beloved pets."We were very lucky to have him in our lives," Susan says. "He was a remarkable little guy."Sign up for the Amazon newsletterGet Amazon news delivered to you weekly.Thank you for signing up.Something went wrong, please try again.Please enter a valid email!Sign UpProtected by reCAPTCHA.

He was high schoolvaledictorian, aNational Merit Scholar,[34][35]and aSilver Knight Awardwinner in 1982.[34]In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind wouldcolonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park".[36]In 1986, he graduatedsumma cum laudefromPrinceton Universitywith a 4.2GPAand aBachelor of Science in Engineeringdegree (B.S.E.) inelectrical engineeringandcomputer science; he was also a member ofPhi Beta Kappa.[37][38]While at Princeton, Bezos was a member of theQuadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[39]In addition, he was elected toTau Beta Piand was the president of the Princeton chapter of theStudents for the Exploration and Development of Space(SEDS).[40][41]Business careerEarly careerAfter Bezos graduated from college in 1986, he was offered jobs atIntel,Bell Labs, andAndersen Consulting, among others.[42]He first worked at Fitel, afintechtelecommunicationsstart-up, where he was tasked with building a network forinternational trade.[43]Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter. He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager atBankers Trustfrom 1988 to 1990. He then joinedD. E. Shaw & Co, a newly createdhedge fundwith a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling from 1990 until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president by age 30.[44][42]AmazonMain article:AmazonBezos (front row, center) at the Robot Co-op in 2005In late 1993, Bezos read that the Internet was growing at a rate of 2300% a year and decided to establish anonline bookstore.[45]He and his then-wife,MacKenzie Scott, left their jobs at D. E. Shaw and founded Amazon in a rented garage inBellevue, Washington on July 5, 1994, after writing itsbusiness planon a cross-country drive from New York City toSeattle.[46][47]With Bezos at the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company's first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially.[48]Prior to settling on Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at anIndian reservationnearSan Franciscoin order to avoid paying taxes.[49]Bezos initially named his new companyCadabrabut later changed the name toAmazonafter theAmazon Riverin South America, in part because the name begins with the letterA, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[50]At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with "A" would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches.[51]In addition, he regarded "Amazon," the name of the world's largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world's largest online bookstore.[51]He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents as investment in Amazon.[47][52][53]He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[54]Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[44][50]Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with aninitial public offering(IPO).[55]In response to critical reports fromFortuneandBarron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such asBordersandBarnes & Noble.[50]In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company's products to include a variety of otherconsumer goods.[50]Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company's 1997equity offeringto finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[50]In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350 million.[56]In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launchAmazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels andwebsite traffic.[50]In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[57]After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[56]In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400 million.[58][failed verification]In November 2007, Bezos launched theAmazon Kindle.[59]According to a 2008Timeprofile, Bezos wished to create a device that allowed a "flow state" in reading similar to the experience of video games.[60]In 2013, Bezos secured a $600-million contract with theCentral Intelligence Agency(CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[61]In October of that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[62]Bezos in 2010In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[63]On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7 million.[64]A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[65]By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109 billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular,Blue Origin.[66]On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon'sSuper Bowl commercial.[67]On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterlyearningsof $2 billion.[68]Due to the growth ofAlibabain China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon intoIndia.[69]On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became theworld's wealthiest personoverMicrosoftco-founderBill Gateswhen his estimatednet worthincreased to just over $90 billion. His wealth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world byForbeson March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112 billion.[70]Bezos receives theJames Smithson Bicentennialmedal on June 14, 2016, for his work with Amazon.[71]In March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon's global senior vice president, to India with $5.5 billion to localize operations throughout the company'ssupply chainroutes.[72]Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon and Bezos, specifically ofsales taxavoidance, misusingpostal routes, andanti-competitivebusiness practices.[73]Amazon's share price fell by 9% in response to the President's negative comments; this reduced Bezos's personal wealth by $10.7 billion.[74]Weeks later, Bezos recouped his losses when academic reports out ofStanford Universityindicated that Trump could do little to regulate Amazon in any meaningful way.[75]During July 2018, a number of members of the U.S. Congress called on Bezos to detail the applications of Amazon'sface recognitionsoftware,Rekognition.[76]Bezos on October 25, 2017, on his visit toLos Angeles Air Force Base.[77]Criticism of Amazon's business practices continued in September 2018 when SenatorBernie Sandersintroduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receivingcorporate welfare.[78]This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers inArizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers inPennsylvaniaandOhio, relied on food stamps.[79]While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: "Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?"[80]He later said: "Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America."[81]Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary "misleading" as it included part-time workers.[82]However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[83]On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[84]The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour, a decision that was interpreted as support for theFight for $15movement.[85]In February 2021, Bezos announced that in thethird quarterof 2021 he would step down from his role as CEO of Amazon to become the Executive Chairman of the Amazon Board.

Bezos was a multi-billionaire who drove a 1996Honda Accord.[139]Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[140][141][142]Bezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[143][144]This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman, who described him as "talking in lists" and "[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made."[140]Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrotea bookthat described Bezos as a demanding boss as well ashyper-competitive,[136][143]and opined that Bezos perhaps "bet the biggest on the Internet" than anyone else.[145]Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles andexternalities.[146][147]During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to weartailored clothing; heweight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[148]His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as themetonymof the company.[149][150]His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has beenparodiedas an enterprisingsupervillain.[151][152][153]Since 2017, he has been portrayed byKyle MooneyandSteve CarellonSaturday Night Live, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure.[154][better source needed]In May 2014, theInternational Trade Union Confederationnamed Bezos the "World's Worst Boss", with its general secretarySharan Burrowsaying: "Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model",[155]while in 2019,Harvard Business Review, which ranked Bezos the best-performing CEO for 4 years in a row since 2014, did not rank him even in the top 100, citing Amazon's "relatively low ESG (environment,social, andgovernance) scores" that reflect "risks created byworking conditionsand employment policies,data security, andantitrustissues."[156]During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses.[27]His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016.[157][27]Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing aNew York Timespiece.[158][159]Leadership style"Day 1" Management PhilosophyDay 1:start upDay 2:stasisDay 3:irrelevanceDay 4: "excruciating, painful decline"Day 5:deathBezos has stated "it is always Day 1" to describe hisgrowth mindset.[160][161]Bezos used what he called a "regret-minimization framework" while he worked atD. E. Shawand again during the early years of Amazon. He described thislife philosophyby stating: "When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes."[162]During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.[38]To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed themantra"Get Big Fast", establishing the company's need toscaleits operations to produce market dominance.[50]He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form ofdividends.[140]Bezos uses the term "work–life harmony" instead of the more standard "work–life balance" because he believes thatbalanceimplies that you can only have one and not the other. He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other.[163]JournalistWalt Mossbergdubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique shouldn't do anything new or interesting "The Bezos Principle".[164]Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule—a preference that meetings are small enough for twopizzasto feed everyone in the boardroom.[165]When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon, he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise thecommon standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.[166]In 2018, it was reported that he met with Amazon investors for just six hours a year.[165]Instead of usingpresentation slides, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives.[167]Since 1998, Bezos has published an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers, not competitors; take risks formarket leadership; facilitate staff morale; build acompany culture; and empower people.[168][169]Bezos maintains the email address jeff@amazon.com[170]as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company. Although he does not respond to the emails, he forwards some of them with a question mark in the subject line to executives who attempt to address the issues.[171]Bezos has citedJeff ImmeltofNew Enterprise Associates,[172]Warren BuffettofBerkshire Hathaway,Jamie DimonofJPMorgan Chase, andBob IgerofThe Walt Disney Companyas major influences on his leadership style.[172][173]RecognitionIn 1999, Bezos received his first major award whenTimenamed himPerson of the Year.[174]In 2008, he was selected byU.S. News & World Reportas one of America's best leaders.[175]Bezos was awarded an honorary doctorate in science and technology fromCarnegie Mellon Universityin 2008.[176]In 2011,The Economistgave Bezos and Gregg Zehr an Innovation Award for theAmazon Kindle.[177]In 2012, Bezos was named Businessperson of the Year byFortune.[178]He is also a member of theBilderberg Groupand attended the 2011 Bilderberg conference inSt. Moritz, Switzerland,[179]and the2013 conferenceinWatford, Hertfordshire, England.

When he was designated the "world wealthiest person" on March 6, 2018, theForbesThe World's Billionaireslist stipulated that although Bezos was the firstcenti-billionaire(i.e. +US$100 billion in net worth), it wasBill Gateswho had the most money when taken inreal terms.[220]In such terms, Gates had $150 billion while Bezos had $100 billion. However, in July 2018, the net worth of Bezos officially surpassed the $150 billion mark, which led most major wealth indexes to label him the wealthiest person in modern history (post-1982).[221]References^Jonge, Peter de (March 14, 1999)."Riding the Wild, Perilous Waters of Amazone.com".The New York Times.ISSN0362-4331.

He is married to MacKenzie Bezos and has four children from the marriage.Bezos’ Family ProfileLet us take a look at the family profile:Jeff Bezos Parents: Ted Jorgensen, Mike Bezos & JacklynTed Jorgensen (Biological)Jeff Bezos’ biological father is Ted Jorgensen. He had abandoned his wife and Jeff Bezos when he was three. At the time when he married his mother, he was a hard-drinking 18-year-old circus performer.Due to his alcohol issues, he could not hold on to his job for long, a reason being a major one for their split. Their marriage fell apart and Jacklyn asked Jorgensen to stay away from his son.Mike Bezos (Stepfather)Adoptive father of Jeff Bezos, Mike has been a constant inspiration for Jeff. He got married to Jacklyn, his mother when Jeff was four. Mike Bezos was a Cuban immigrant, who moved to USA just a few months back.Jacklyn (née Gise)Jacklyn is Jeff Bezos’ mother, who married Ted Jorgensen when she was just sixteen. The marriage lasted just one year. After that, she married Mike Bezos, who was a Cuban Immigrant, when he was 15 years old. He worked his way to University of Albuquerque and then moved ahead adopting Jeff. The family then moved to Houston, Texas.Jeff Bezos Spouse – MacKenzie BezosMacKenzie BezosBorn – 1 January 1970MacKenzie Bezos is the wife of Jeff Bezos. She is a famous American Novelist. Bezos was born and bought up in California. Her father was a financial planner, while her mother was a homemaker. For her studies, she attended the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut and then graduated from the Princeton University. Mackenzie has taken up a writing course under the writer Toni Morrison, who commented that she was one of the best writers in the class. She also won the 2006 American Book Award.

Mark Bezos works at the Robin Hood. He is also a part of the poverty-fighting charity in New York City and the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company in suburban New York.  The only similarity between both of them is that they believe that “Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody’s life, but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one.” Mark had made occasional appearances in the biographies and interviews of Jeff, but a simple and shy Mark keeps a low profile.Networth of Bezos’ FamilyThe total networth of Bezos’ family now stands at $32.3 billion as of 2014Related PostsBharat Desai – Family, Family TreeDietmarr Hopp – Family, Family TreeMarkus Persson – Family, Family TreeSundar Pichai – Family , Family TreeTim Cook – Family, Family TreeRelated PostsBharat Desai – Family, Family TreeDietmarr Hopp – Family, Family TreeMarkus Persson – Family, Family TreeSundar Pichai – Family , Family TreeTim Cook – Family, Family TreeMost VisitedPablo Escobar Family – Family Tree- 365068  viewsJeff Bezos Family- 80835  viewsDolly Parton – Family, Family Tree- 80010  viewsBill Gates Family- 71417  viewsPatrice Motsepe Family- 68479  viewsShahid Khan Family- 48651  viewsMark Cuban Family- 47948  views|Back to top

They were both still in high school at the time. They got married before their son was born.The marriage lasted only 17 months,reports Brad Stone at Bloomberg Businessweek, who has unearthed astonishing new details about Bezos' family's early years.Gise moved in with her parents becauseJorgensen stayed out late, and drank too much, and was generally an inattentive father and husband says Stone. He agreed to a divorce, and paid a small amount of child support to Gise when he had money. Other times he missed the payments.Three years after their divorce, Gise married another man, Miguel Bezos, a Cuban immigrant who taught himself English, and eventually worked at Exxon. Miguel adopted Jeff, and Jeff took his last name. Jorgensen had to sign off on the name change, which he did, Stone reports.For a brief period Jorgensen remembered the Bezos name, but through the years he forgot about it, and dropped completely out of touch with his ex-wife and his son.Jorgensen's absence from Bezos' life was so complete that ina 1999 interview with Wired, Bezos said of Jorgensen, "I've never met him," although, in reality he lived with him for the first year of his life."The reality, as far as I'm concerned, is that my Dad is my natural father. The only time I ever think about it, genuinely, is when a doctor asks me to fill out a form," said Bezos in 1999.Jorgensen, for his part, had a nearly identical attitude about Bezos.However, Stone managed to find Jorgensen, now 69, who owns a bike shop in Glendale, Arizona.Here's how Jorgensen reacted when Stone introduced himself: "He had no idea what I was talking about. Jorgensen said he didn’t know who Jeff Bezos was and was baffled by my suggestion that he was the father of this famous CEO."Stone jogged Jorgensen's memory, trotting out details about Bezos and his mother. Says Stone, "The old man’s face flushed with recognition. 'Is he still alive?' he asked, not yet fully comprehending."Bezos' biological father had disconnected so thoroughly from Bezos life that not only did he not remember his name, and not only did he not realize his son was one of the richest men in the world, but he wasn't even sure if his son was still alive.Jorgensen says that in his younger days "I wasn’t a good father or a husband." He eventually quit drinking, got his act together and opened his bike shop. He's married, but had no other children in his life beyond Bezos.A family friend told Stone later that Jorgensen felt overwhelmed with sadness and regret. He wants to get in touch with Bezos, but it's unclear if that will ever happen.Stone has a book coming out about Amazon.It's excerpted at Bloomberg BusinessWeek. Thestuff about his father starts at the bottom of the seventh page.Sign up for notifications from Insider!

CEO ofAmazon, is one of the world’s most influential business leaders. He has revolutionized the retail industry and has become one of thewealthiest individuals in the world. Though his accomplishments are legendary, there are some interesting facts about his childhood and family that are not as widely known.Bezos was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1964 to a teenage mother,Jacklyn Gise.His biological father,Ted Jorgensen,died in 2015 without having the chance to reunite with his son. Gise and Jorgensen were married for two years before Gise left with her infant child.In the book “The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and Amazon,” authorBrad Stonedetails his conversation with Jorgensen in 2012, who was initially unaware of his connection to Bezos.“I used to wonder all the time though whatever happened to Jeff. Then I just reached a point where I thought he was long gone. That was the only child I ever had – that makes a difference too. The last time I saw him he was in diapers,” Jorgensenreportedlysaid.Gise went on to marryMiguel Bezos, a Cuban immigrant, who adopted Bezos when he was four years old.Also Read:You Can Become A Landlord In Just 10 Minutes Thanks To This Jeff Bezos-Backed StartupGrowing up, Bezos had a natural curiosity and interest in technology and science, but his family was not wealthy.

He started a summer camp for kids when he was 12 and ran it for several years. He also took on a variety of odd jobs, including working as a fry cook, delivering newspapers, and working at McDonald’s.Bezos’s family was also a source of inspiration for him. His grandfather,Lawrence Preston Gise, was an engineer and a successful entrepreneur. Bezos often sought his grandfather’s advice and was inspired by his drive and ambition.Bezos has also credited his mother with instilling in him the value of hard work. Jacklyn Gise worked long hours for most of her life to support her family, and her dedication and commitment to her work had a major influence on Bezos. He has said that his mother showed him that if you work hard and focus on the long term, you can achieve great things.Now Read:6 Of The Most Inspirational Jeff Bezos Quotes: 'If You Never Want To Be Criticized, For Goodness' Sake Don't Do Anything New'This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo: Shutterstock© 2023 Benzinga.com.

Bezos launched the e-commerce juggernaut Amazon — an online retailer of books and, eventually, a wide range of commodities — in his Seattle garage in 1994. In July 2021, he stepped down as CEO and became the executive chairman. As the founder and CEO of Amazon.com, Inc., he was instrumental in the growth of e-commerce. Under his guidance, Amazon grew to become the largest retailer on the internet and the paradigm for internet sales. This, and much more, is why we must commemorate the birthday of this amazing personality!Fast FactsFull Name:Jeffrey Preston BezosNickname:JeffBirth date:January 12, 1964Age:59Zodiac Sign:CapricornHeight:5' 7.3"Relationship Status:In a relationshipNet Worth:$163.3 billionJeffrey's Social Media:BackgroundJeff Bezos was born in Seattle to parents Jacklyn Gise and Ted Jorgensen, and was raised by Miguel Bezos when his mother married. He spent his summers as a child on his grandfather’s Texan ranch, where he built pipes, vaccinated cattle, and repaired windmills. He earned a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science from Princeton University. He worked on Wall Street for various firms namely — Fitel, Bankers Trust, and D. E. Shaw & Co, New York. While working for D.E. Shaw, Bezos met MacKenzie Tuttle, with whom he married in 1993. They had four children together. After divorcing his wife, Bezos started dating Lauren Sanchez, a former news anchor, T.V. show host, and helicopter pilot.In 1984, he began working as a Programmer/Analyst in Norway for the summer, and the following year, he enhanced an IBM Program in California. In 1990, he joined D. E. Shaw & Co. in New York and was the company’s youngest Vice President at the time. Despite the fact that their financial situation was quite advantageous, he elected to depart after four years. He went on to create his firm, and in 1995 he became the founder of Amazon.com — an online bookstore. Analysts were leery of its viability in comparison to regular retailers at first, but he quickly overtook such competitors. In 2003, Amazon launched A9, a commercial search engine specializing in e-commerce websites. He also started an online sporting products store with over 3,000 different brands.Amazon later went on to introduce the Kindle, a portable electronic reading device that uses E-Ink to generate text with customizable font size to improve ease of reading, in 2007. Bezos also announced the Kindle Fire, a color touchscreen tablet computer that competed with Apple’s iPad. Amazon bought e-readers comfort and convenience with lighted touchscreens that permitted reading in the dark with the Kindle Paperwhite. He also paid $250 million cash for “The Washington Post,” and other linked magazines, thereby ending the Graham family’s four-generation dominance. In 2017, Bezos — with a net worth of roughly $90 billion — surpassed Bill Gates as the world’s richest person.Career timeline1985The IBM ProgramHe improves an IBM program in California.1991]The Youngest Vice PresidentHe joins D.E.

The single-room school is planned to accommodate about a dozen students, ages 3 to 5 years old, and will be open year-round, five days a week, the organization said.The Day 1 Academies Fund said the school will follow coronavirus safety measures outlined by Washington state officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Child care and early learning programs remain open in Washington state.Enrollment at the school is currently underway, the Day 1 Academies Fund said. An Amazon spokesperson declined to say how many schools Bezos Academy plans to open.Bezos first unveiled hisplan to launcha network of "Montessori-inspired" preschools in September 2018. The schools are built in low-income communities and designed for underserved children, offering them access to free programs.Montessori schools emphasize hands-on and self-directed learning, with uninterrupted blocks of working time, in mixed-age classrooms.

"The child will be the customer," he added.Bezos launched the Day One Fund with a $2 billion commitment in September 2018, with the goal of launching preschools under the Day 1 Academies Fund and helping homeless families under the Day 1 Families Fund.The Day One Fund has been closely watched since its announcement two years ago.

This one in Des Moines, WA, is the first of many free preschools that we’ll be opening for underserved children.”The preschool will have a year-round curriculum, five days a week, for children 3-5 years old. According to the Bezos Day Onewebsite, the team selected to put the preschool in Des Moines, a town to the south of Seattle based on income levels, rates of participation in free and reduced-cost meal programs, gaps in access to license childcare providers, and buy-in from local businesses who will support the growth of the preschool. It will continue to use this kind of data set for choosing locations to other schools.Bezos first announced his intention to build a network of preschools in November 2018, when he launched the $2 billion Bezos Day One Fund. The fund has two priorities: giving to nonprofits that are helping homeless families, and building a network of preschools. Since its launch, the fund has given around $100 milliona yearto a variety of homeless-focused nonprofits. The Amazon founder has remained relatively quiet about the schools initiative, until today.The schools will be inspired by Montessori, a method of education where curriculums are more hands-on, collaborative, and change based on the individual student’s own interests. Bezos attended a Montessori school when he was 2 years old in Albuquerque, New Mexico. “You know, intuitively, I think it was probably a very formative experience for me to be able to go to those classes, in that environment, and be so stimulated at an early age,” BezostoldMontessori Lifemagazine in a 2000 interview. “I don’t actually know what the scientific research shows, but intuitively I have to imagine that it’s good for little kids.” In the same interview, Bezos recalled “tracing out letters on sandpaper” and “painting on a big easel.”The network of preschools will operate under the parent nonprofit organization, also called Bezos Academy. The group is in the process of hiring for a position that will  assess the success or failures of the preschool program.Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Send me a securetip.Angel Au-YeungEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

Here are just a few other standout former Montessori children: Google foundersSergey Brin & Larry Page, Nobel prize winnerGabriel García Márquez,master game designerWill Wright Wright, and NBA superstarSteph Curry.“I benefited from [my] Montessori education, which in some ways gives the students a lot more freedom to do things at their own pace, to discover… Some of the credit for the willingness to go on your own interests, you can tie that back to that Montessori education.”— Sergey Brin, Co-Founder of Google and Montessori childA message to Jeff BezosWith the near opening of your first preschool inspired by Montessori, we’d like to say thank you and cheers to your great investment in children … and therefore in all of us.

Bezos said the school is "the first of many free preschools that we'll be opening for underserved children."This classroom is just the beginning. The @bezosacademy opens its doors on Oct. 19th. This one in Des Moines, WA, is the first of many free preschools that we’ll be opening for underserved children. Extra kudos to the team for figuring out how to make this happen even amidst COVID, and to Wesley Homes for stepping up with the facility.A post shared by  Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos) on Sep 22, 2020 at 6:30am PDTSep 22, 2020 at 6:30am PDTBezos Academy is a "Montessori-inspired" preschool that will serve children between the ages of 3 and 5. The schools will be full-day and year-round, and will be tuition free for its students.According to a post on theBezos AcademyInstagram account, the team began working on the schools early last year. Other posts from the page, which began posting photos in August, show Bezos touring Montessori schools around the country, meeting with students in Nashville and Washington, DC.Bezos announced his push into education in 2018, when heunveiled his two philanthropic initiatives: the Day 1 Families Fund and the Day 1 Academies Fund. Both initiatives are funded by the Bezos Day One Fund, to which Bezos committed $2 billion at the time.The mission of the Academies Fund was to create a network of preschools in which "the child will be the customer." The schools will be directly operated by Bezos' fund, which "creates an opportunity to learn, invent, and improve" upon early childhood education,according to the fund's website.The schools began hiring for several positions, including Montessori specialists and a head of school, earlier this year,GeekWire reportedat the time.

                                  as well as other partner offers and accept ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy.Winter is upon us, which means it's prime vacation season. But for the wealthy and powerful, vacations look a little different.Take Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, for instance: He spends time surfing near his nearly 1,500 acres in Hawaiiandat his super-private retreat on Lake Tahoe. Or there's Tim Cook, Apple's billionaire CEO, who spends his time away from running the iPhone-maker exploring America's national parks.Take a look at how some of the nation's most high-powered billionaire execs spend their vacations.When he's not in the San Francisco Bay area running Meta, CEO Mark Zuckerberg frequently travels to his nearly 1,500-acre estate on the north shore of the Hawaiian island Kauai. He's often spotted surfing or foiling in the waves off Kauai, which he says helps take his mind off work.KENZO TRIBOUILLARD / Contributor / GettySource:Insider,InsiderZuckerberg first put down roots on the island in 2014, and his presence there has frustrated locals due to what they say is a failure to respect the island's history, Insider has reported. Zuckerberg's representatives say he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, work closely with the community on issues like sustainability and wildlife conservation.Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty ImagesSource:InsiderZuckerberg has also spent tens of millions of dollars on a super-private estate on Lake Tahoe's west shore, just outside Tahoe City. Tahoe is a popular destination for Bay Area residents in both the summer and winter, because they can take advantage of boating and water sports in the warmer months and skiing and snowboarding in the colder months.Two tourists paddle board on Lake Tahoe in 2019.AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, FileSource:Insider,InsiderAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has been building an expensive real estate portfolio over the past few years, and his most recent addition makes for the perfect destination: a home in Maui, Hawaii.Jeff Bezos at the opening of the Amazon Spheres in Seattle, Washington, in 2018.REUTERS/Lindsey WassonSource:InsiderBezos and his girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez, purchased the home, located in an isolated area on the island's south shore near lava fields, in October 2021 for a reported $78 million.A home in Maui, Hawaii, though not Bezos' property.ejs9/Getty ImagesSource:Insider,Pacific Business News,New York PostBut Bezos seems to spend a lot of time vacationing since stepping down as Amazon CEO, and will soon have a new way to travel: a 417-foot mega-yacht that's expected to be one of the most luxurious yachts ever made.A mega-yacht, though not the one belonging to Bezos.3PhotoFilipposFilippou/Getty ImagesSource:InsiderMichael Dell, who has a net worth of over $47 billion, has a lavish real estate empire that spans from Texas to New York City.

Guests can book a room or rent out the whole island, and can partake in water sports, snorkeling, and sailing; play tennis; do yoga; or visit the spa. Branson said in 2013 that he has an office on the island and that "it's easy to attract people to come from all over the world, to plot and plan things."A view of Necker island.Todd VanSickle/APSource:InsiderMuch like Branson, Oracle founder Larry Ellison also owns an entire island — or 98% of one anyway. But rather than one in the Caribbean, Ellison bought Lana'i, a small island that's part of Hawaii.AP Photo/Eric RisbergSource:InsiderSince purchasing Lana'i in 2012 for a reported $300 million, Ellison has worked to turn it into a wellness utopia for the ultra-wealthy: the island boasts a Four Seasons hotel and a Nobu, a high-end sushi restaurant. But residents of Lana'i have bristled at Ellison's ownership and many say they are now being priced out, according to Bloomberg.The Hawaiian island of Lana'i, owned by Larry Ellison.Ted Soqui/Getty ImagesSource:Insider,BloombergAnother billionaire who can't resist a Hawaii vacation is Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce.Marc BenioffNICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty ImagesBenioff, who's worth over $5.8 billion, spent $12.5 million on a 5-acre estate on the Big Island in 2000.
