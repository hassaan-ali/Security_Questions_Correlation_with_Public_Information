Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims 171 172 173 withMIT Technology Reviewdescribing them as highly speculative and neuroscience theater . 171 During the demonstration Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell. 168 In 2022 Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year. 174 Neuralink has conducted furtheranimal testingonmacaque monkeysat theUniversity of California Davis Primate Research Center. In 2021 the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video gamePongvia a Neuralink implant. The company s animal trials which have caused the deaths of some monkeys have led to claims ofanimal cruelty. ThePhysicians Committee for Responsible Medicinehas alleged that Neuralink s animal trials have violated theAnimal Welfare Act. 175 Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022 a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink. 176 The Boring CompanyMain article The Boring CompanyMusk during the 2018 inauguration of theBoring Test Tunnelin Hawthorne CaliforniaIn 2017 Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels and revealed plans for specialized underground high occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour 240 km h and thus circumvent above ground traffic in major cities. 177 178 Early in 2017 the company began discussions withregulatory bodiesand initiated construction of a 30 foot 9.1 m wide 50 foot 15 m long and 15 foot 4.6 m deep test trench on the premises of SpaceX s offices as that required no permits. 179 TheLos Angeles tunnel less than two miles 3.2 km in length debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model X s and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds. 180 Two tunnel projects announced in 2018 in Chicago and West Los Angeles have been canceled. 181 182 However a tunnel beneath theLas Vegas Convention Centerwas completed in early 2021. 183 Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system. 184 In 2021 tunnel construction was approved forFort Lauderdale Florida. 185 TwitterFurther information Acquisition of Twitter by Elon MuskElon MuskTwitter elonmuskI made an offerhttps sec.gov Archives edgar...April 14 2022 186 Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017 187 and had previously questioned the platform s commitment tofreedom of speech. 188 189 In January 2022 Musk started purchasing Twitter shares reaching a 9.2 stake by April 190 making him the largest shareholder. 191 e When this was publicly disclosed Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company s 2013 IPO. 193 On April 4 Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter s board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9 of the company. 194 195 However on April 13 Musk made a 43 billion offer to buy Twitter launching a takeover bid to buy 100 of Twitter s stock at 54.20 per share. 191 196 In response Twitter s board adopted a poison pill shareholder rights planto make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15 of the company without board approval. 197 Nevertheless by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately 44 billion. 198 This included about 12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and 21 billion in equity financing. 199 200 Tesla s stock market value sank by over 100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal causing Musk to lose around 30 billion of his net worth. 201 202 He subsequently tweeted criticism of Twitter executiveVijaya Gadde s policies to his 86 million followers which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her. 203 Exactly a month after announcing the takeover Musk stated that the deal was on hold following a report that 5 of Twitter s daily active users were spam accounts 204 causing Twitter shares to drop more than 10 percent. 205 Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition 206 he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July Twitter s Board of Directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction. 207 On July 12 2022 Twitter formally sued Musk in theChancery Court of Delawarefor breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter. 208 In October 2022 Musk reversed again offering to purchase Twitter at 54.20 per share. 209 The acquisition was officially completed on October 27. 210 Immediately after the acquisition Musk fired top Twitter executives like CEOParag Agrawal 210 211 whom he replaced. 212 He instituted a 7.99 monthly subscription for a blue check 213 214 215 and laid off a significant portion of the company s staff. 216 217 Musk lessened content moderation 218 and in December Musk releasedinternal documentsrelating to Twitter s moderation ofHunter Biden s laptopin the leadup to the2020 presidential election. 219 TheSouthern Poverty Law Centernoted that Twitter has verified numerous extremists. 220 A study of millions of tweets following the acquisition indicated that hate speech on the platform has become more visible under Musk s leadership. 221 Within the first weeks of ownership Musk made a series of short lived decisions and changes that he quickly reversed including introducing a paid blue checkmark 222 creating an official label 223 and forbidding linking to one s profiles on other social media platforms. 224 Under Musk s management Twitter experienced several large scale outages. 225 226 In April 2022 The Washington Postreported that Musk privately claimed supposed censorship on the platform including the banning of accounts such asThe Babylon Bee had prompted him to begin the acquisition. Following the acquisition he made reinstatement of accounts like theBeean immediate priority. 227 TheNew York Postrevealed that Musk s ex wife Talulah Riley had encouraged Musk to purchase Twitter specifically citing theBee s ban. 228 On December 18 Musk posted a poll to his Twitter account asking users to decide whether he should step down as the head of Twitter with 57.5 out of the more than 17.5 million votes supporting that decision. 229 Musk then announced that he would resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job . 230 Leadership styleMusk giving a speech to SpaceX employees in 2012Musk is often described as amicromanagerand has called himself a nano manager . 231 The New York Timeshas characterized his approach asabsolutist. 232 Musk does not make formalbusiness plans 232 instead he says he prefers to approach engineering problems non sequitur with an iterative designmethodology and tolerance for failures . 233 He has forced employees to adopt the company s own jargon and launched ambitious risky and costly projects against his advisors recommendations such as removing front facing radar fromTesla Autopilot. His insistence onvertical integrationcauses his companies to move most production in house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX s rocket 234 vertical integration has caused many usability problems for Tesla s software. 231 Musk s handling of employees whom he communicates with directly through mass emails has been characterized as carrot and stick rewarding those who offer constructive criticism while also being known to impulsively threaten swear at and fire his employees. 235 236 237 Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours sometimes for 80 hours per week. 238 He has his new employees sign strictnon disclosure agreementsand often fires in sprees 239 240 such as during the Model 3 production hell in 2018. 240 In 2022 Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla s workforce due to his concerns about the economy. 241 That same month he suspendedremote workat SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office. 242 Musk s leadership has been praised by some who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors 231 and criticized by others who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as show ing a lack of human understanding. 237 243 The 2021 bookPower Playcontains anecdotes of Musk berating employees. 244 The Wall Street Journalreported that after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as self driving he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer lives at risk with some employees resigning in consequence. 245 Other activitiesMusk FoundationMusk is the president of the Musk Foundation 246 whose stated purpose is to provide solar power energy systems in disaster areas support research development and advocacy for interests including human space exploration pediatrics renewable energy and safe artificial intelligence and support science and engineering educational efforts. 247 From 2002 to 2018 the foundation gave 25 million directly to non profit organizations nearly half of which went to Musk s OpenAI 248 which was then non profit. 249 Since 2002 the foundation has made over 350 donations. Around half were to scientific research or education nonprofits.

However he was dissatisfied with the great expense ofrocketlaunchers. In 2002 he founded Space Exploration Technologies SpaceX to make more affordable rockets. Its first two rockets were theFalcon1 first launched in 2006 and the larger Falcon 9 first launched in 2010 which were designed to cost much less than competing rockets. A third rocket theFalcon Heavy first launched in 2018 was designed to carry 117 000 pounds 53 000 kg to orbit nearly twice as much as its largest competitor theBoeingCompany sDeltaIV Heavy for one third the cost. SpaceX has announced the successor to the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy the Super Heavy Starship system. The Super Heavy first stage would be capable of lifting 100 000 kg 220 000 pounds to low Earth orbit. The payload would be the Starship a spacecraft designed for providing fasttransportationbetween cities on Earth and building bases on the Moon and Mars.

In 2006 Tesla introduced its first car theRoadster which could travel 245 miles 394 km on a single charge. Unlike most previous electric vehicles which Musk thought were stodgy and uninteresting it was a sports car that could go from 0 to 60 miles 97 km per hour in less than four seconds. In 2010 the company sinitial public offeringraised about 226 million. Two years later Tesla introduced the Model S sedan which was acclaimed by automotive critics for its performance and design. The company won further praise for its Model X luxury SUV which went on the market in 2015.

He expressed reservations about Tesla s being publicly traded and in August 2018 he made a series of tweets about taking the company private at avalueof 420 per share noting that he had secured funding. The value of 420 was seen as a joking reference to April 20 a day celebrated by devotees ofcannabis. The following month the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission SEC sued Musk for securities fraud alleging that the tweets were false and misleading. Shortly thereafter Tesla s board rejected the SEC s proposed settlement reportedly because Musk had threatened to resign. However the news sent Tesla stock plummeting and a harsher deal was ultimately accepted. Its terms included Musk s stepping down aschairmanfor three years though he was allowed to continue as CEO his tweets were to be preapproved by Tesla lawyers and fines of 20 million for both Tesla and Musk werelevied.Musk was critical of Twitter s commitment to principles offree speech in light of the company s content moderation policies. Early in April 2022 Twitter s filings with the SEC disclosed that Musk had bought more than 9 percent of the company. Shortly thereafter Twitter announced that Musk would join the company s board but Musk decided against that and made a bid for the entire company at a value of 54.20 a share for 44 billion. Twitter s board accepted the deal which would make him sole owner of the company.

A self described bookworm he made few friends in those places. They got my best expletive friend to lure me out of hiding so they could beat me up. And that expletive hurt Musk said. For some reason they decided that I was it and they were going to go after me nonstop. That s what made growing up difficult. For a number of years there was no respite. You get chased around by gangs at school who tried to beat the expletive out of me and then I d come home and it would just be awful there as well.

With a fellow student he bought a 10 bedroom fraternity house which they used as an ad hoc nightclub.Musk graduated with a bachelor of science degree in physics in addition to a bachelor of arts in economics from theWharton School.The two majors foreshadowed Musk s career but it was physics that left the deepest impression. Physics is a good framework for thinking he would say later. Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there. Notable AccomplishmentsMusk was 24 years old when he moved to California to pursue a Ph.D. in applied physics at Stanford University. But with the internet exploding and Silicon Valley booming Musk had entrepreneurial visions dancing in his head.

By 2008 SpaceX was well established and NASA awarded the company the contract to handle cargo transport for the International Space Station with plans for astronaut transport in the future in a move to replace NASA s own space shuttle missions.Elon Musk poses for a portrait in Los Angeles California on July 25 2008.Photo Dan Tuffs Getty ImagesFalcon 9 RocketsOn May 22 2012 Musk and SpaceX made history when the company launched its Falcon 9 rocket into space with an unmanned capsule. The vehicle was sent to the International Space Station with 1 000 pounds of supplies for the astronauts stationed there marking the first time a private company had sent a spacecraft to the International Space Station. Of the launch Musk was quoted as saying I feel very lucky. ... For us it s like winning the Super Bowl. In December 2013 a Falcon 9 successfully carried a satellite to geosynchronous transfer orbit a distance at which the satellite would lock into an orbital path that matched the Earth s rotation. In February 2015 SpaceX launched another Falcon 9 fitted with the Deep Space Climate Observatory DSCOVR satellite aiming to observe the extreme emissions from the sun that affect power grids and communications systems on Earth.In March 2017 SpaceX saw the successful test flight and landing of a Falcon 9 rocket made from reusable parts a development that opened the door for more affordable space travel.A setback came in November 2017 when an explosion occurred during a test of the company s new Block 5 Merlin engine. SpaceX reported that no one was hurt and that the issue would not hamper its planned rollout of a future generation of Falcon 9 rockets.The company enjoyed another milestone moment in February 2018 with the successful test launch of the powerful Falcon Heavy rocket. Armed with additional Falcon 9 boosters the Falcon Heavy was designed to carry immense payloads into orbit and potentially serve as a vessel for deep space missions. For the test launch the Falcon Heavy was given a payload of Musk s cherry red Tesla Roadster equipped with cameras to provide some epic views for the vehicle s planned orbit around the sun.In July 2018 Space X enjoyed the successful landing of a new Block 5 Falcon rocket which touched down on a drone ship less than 9 minutes after liftoff.BFR Mission to MarsIn September 2017 Musk presented an updated design plan for his BFR an acronym for either Big F ing Rocket or Big Falcon Rocket a 31 engine behemoth topped by a spaceship capable of carrying at least 100 people. He revealed that SpaceX was aiming to launch the first cargo missions to Mars with the vehicle in 2022 as part of his overarching goal of colonizing the Red Planet.In March 2018 the entrepreneur told an audience at the annual South by Southwest festival in Austin Texas that he hoped to have the BFR ready for short flights early the following year while delivering a knowing nod at his previous problems with meeting deadlines.The following month it was announced that SpaceX would construct a facility at the Port of Los Angeles to build and house the BFR. The port property presented an ideal location for SpaceX as its mammoth rocket will only be movable by barge or ship when completed.Starlink Internet SatellitesIn late March 2018 SpaceX received permission from the U.S. government to launch a fleet of satellites into low orbit for the purpose of providing Internet service. The satellite network named Starlink would ideally make broadband service more accessible in rural areas while also boosting competition in heavily populated markets that are typically dominated by one or two providers.SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites in May 2019 and followed with another payload of 60 satellites that November. While this represented significant progress for the Starlink venture the appearance of these bright orbiters in the night sky with the potential of thousands more to come worried astronomers who felt that a proliferation of satellites would increase the difficulty of studying distant objects in space.Tesla MotorsMusk is the co founder CEO and product architect at Tesla Motors a company formed in 2003that is dedicated to producing affordable mass market electric cars as well as battery products and solar roofs. Musk oversees all product development engineering and design of the company s products.RoadsterFive years after its formation in March 2008 Tesla unveiled the Roadster a sports car capable of accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 3.7 seconds as well as traveling nearly 250 miles between charges of its lithium ion battery.With a stake in the company taken by Daimler and a strategic partnership with Toyota Tesla Motors launched its initial public offering in June 2010 raising 226 million.Model SIn August 2008 Tesla announced plans for its Model S the company s first electric sedan thatwas reportedly meantto take on the BMW 5 series. In 2012 the Model S finally entered production at a starting price of 58 570. Capable of covering 265 miles between charges it was honored as the 2013 Car of the Year byMotor Trendmagazine.In April 2017 Tesla announced that it surpassed General Motors to become the most valuable U.S. car maker. The news was an obvious boon to Tesla which was looking to ramp up production and release its Model 3 sedan later that year.In September 2019 using what Musk described as a Plaid powertrain a Model S set a speed record for four door sedan at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey County California.Model 3The Model 3 was officially launchedin early 2019 following extensive production delays. The car was initially priced at 35 000 a much more accessible price point than the 69 500 and up for its Model S and X electric sedans.After initially aiming to produce 5 000 new Model 3 cars per week by December 2017 Musk pushed that goal back to March 2018 and then to June with the start of the new year. The announced delay didn t surprise industry experts who were well aware of the company s production problems though some questioned how long investors would remain patient with the process. It also didn t prevent Musk from garnering a radical new compensation package as CEO in which he would be paid after reaching milestones of growing valuation based on 50 billion increments.By April 2018 with Tesla expected to fall short of first quarter production forecasts news surfaced that Musk had pushed aside the head of engineering to personally oversee efforts in that division. In a Twitter exchange with a reporter Musk said it was important to divide and conquer to meet production goals and was back to sleeping at factory. After signaling that the company would reorganize its management structure Musk in June announced that Tesla was laying off 9 percent of its workforce though its production department would remain intact. In an email to employees Musk explained his decision to eliminate some duplication of roles to cut costs admitting it was time to take serious steps toward turning a profit.The restructuring appeared to pay dividends as it was announced that Tesla had met its goal of producing 5 000 Model 3 cars per week by the end of June 2018 while churning out another 2 000 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. We did it Musk wrote in a celebratory email to the company. What an incredible job by an amazing team. The following February Musk announced that the company was finally rolling out its standard Model 3. Musk also said that Tesla was shifting to all online sales and offering customers the chance to return their cars within seven days or 1 000 miles for a full refund.Semi TruckIn November 2017 Musk made another splash with the unveiling of the new Tesla Semi and Roadster at the company s design studio. The semi truck which was expected to enter into production in 2019 before being delayed boasts 500 miles of range as well as a battery and motors built to last 1 million miles.Model Y and RoadsterIn March 2019 Musk unveiledTesla s long awaited Model Y. The compact crossover which began arriving for customers in March 2020 has a driving range of 300 miles and a 0 to 60 mph time of 3.5 seconds.The Roadster also set to be released in 2020 will become the fastest production car ever made with a 0 to 60 time of 1.9 seconds.SolarCityIn August 2016 in Musk s continuing effort to promote and advance sustainable energy and products for a wider consumer base a 2.6 billion dollar deal was solidified to combine his electric car and solar energy companies. His Tesla Motors Inc. announced an all stock deal purchase of SolarCity Corp. a company Musk had helped his cousins start in 2006. He is a majority shareholder in each entity. Solar and storage are at their best when they re combined. As one company Tesla storage and SolarCity solar can create fully integrated residential commercial and grid scale products that improve the way that energy is generated stored and consumed read a statement on Tesla s website about the deal.The Boring CompanyIn January 2017 Musk launched The Boring Company a company devoted to boring and building tunnels in order to reduce street traffic. He began with a test dig on the SpaceX property in Los Angeles.In late October of that year Musk posted the first photo of his company s progress to his Instagram page. He said the 500 foot tunnel which would generally run parallel to Interstate 405 would reach a length of two miles in approximately four months.In May 2019 the company now known as TBC landed a 48.7 million contract from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority to build an underground Loop system to shuttle people around the Las Vegas Convention Center.TwitterIn October 2022 Musk officiallybought Twitterand became the social media company s CEO after months of back and forth.DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY S ELON MUSK FACT CARDMusk s Tweet and SEC InvestigationOn August 7 2018 Musk dropped a bombshell via a tweet Am considering taking Tesla private at 420. Funding secured. The announcement opened the door for legal action against the company and its founder as the SEC began inquiring about whether Musk had indeed secured the funding as claimed. Several investors filed lawsuits on the grounds that Musk was looking to manipulate stock prices and ambush short sellers with his tweet.Musk s tweet initially sent Tesla stock spiking before it closed the day up 11 percent. The CEO followed up with a letter on the company blog calling the move to go private the best path forward. He promised to retain his stake in the company and added that he would create a special fund to help all current investors remain on board.Six days later Musk sought to clarify his position with a statement in which he pointed to discussions with the managing director of the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund as the source of his funding secured declaration. He later tweeted that he was working on a proposal to take Tesla private with Goldman Sachs and Silver Lake as financial advisers.The saga took a bizarre turn that day when rapper Azealia Banks wrote on Instagram that as a guest at Musk s home at the time she learned that he was under the influence of LSD when he fired off his headline grabbing tweet. Banks said she overheard Musk making phone calls to drum up the funding he promised was already in place.The news quickly turned serious again when it was reported that Tesla s outside directors had retained two law firms to deal with the SEC inquiry and the CEO s plans to take the company private.On August 24 one day after meeting with the board Musk announced that he had reversed course and would not be taking the company private. Among his reasons he cited the preference of most directors to keep Tesla public as well as the difficulty of retaining some of the large shareholders who were prohibited from investing in a private company. Others suggested that Musk was also influenced by the poor optics of an electric car company being funded by Saudi Arabia a country heavily involved in the oil industry.On September 29 2018 it was announced that Musk would pay a 20 million fine and step down as chairman of Tesla s board for three years as part of an agreement with the SEC.Inventions and InnovationsHyperloopIn August 2013 Musk released a concept for a new form of transportation called the Hyperloop an invention that would foster commuting between major cities while severely cutting travel time. Ideally resistant to weather and powered by renewable energy the Hyperloop would propel riders in pods through a network of low pressure tubes at speeds reaching more than 700 mph. Musk noted that the Hyperloop could take from seven to 10 years to be built and ready for use.Although he introduced the Hyperloop with claims that it would be safer than a plane or train with an estimated cost of 6 billion approximately one tenth of the cost for the rail system planned by the state of California Musk s concept has drawn skepticism. Nevertheless the entrepreneur has sought to encourage the development of this idea.After he announced a competition for teams to submit their designs for a Hyperloop pod prototype the first Hyperloop Pod Competition was held at the SpaceX facility in January 2017. A speed record of 284 mph was set by a German student engineering team at competition No. 3 in 2018 with the same team pushing the record to 287 mph the next year.AI and NeuralinkMusk has pursued an interest in artificial intelligence becoming co chair of the nonprofit OpenAI. The research company launched in late 2015 with the stated mission of advancing digital intelligence to benefit humanity.In 2017 it was also reported that Musk was backing a venture called Neuralink which intends to create devices to be implanted in the human brain and help people merge with software. He expanded on the company s progress during a July 2019 discussion revealing that its devices will consist of a microscopic chip that connects via Bluetooth to a smartphone.High Speed TrainIn late November 2017 after Chicago MayorRahm Emanuelasked for proposals to build and operate a high speed rail line that would transport passengers from O Hare Airport to downtown Chicago in 20 minutes or less Musk tweeted that he was all in on the competition with The Boring Company. He said that the concept of the Chicago loop would be different from his Hyperloop its relatively short route not requiring the need for drawing a vacuum to eliminate air friction.In summer 2018 Musk announced he would cover the estimated 1 billion needed to dig the 17 mile tunnel from the airport to downtown Chicago. However in late 2019 he tweeted that TBC would focus on completing the commercial tunnel in Las Vegas before turning to other projects suggesting that plans for Chicago would remain in limbo for the immediate future.FlamethrowerMusk also reportedly found a market for The Boring Company s flamethrowers. After announcing they were going on sale for 500 apiece in late January 2018 he claimed to have sold 10 000 of them within a day.Relationship with Donald TrumpIn December 2016 Musk was named toPresident Trump sStrategy and Policy Forum the following January he joined Trump s Manufacturing Jobs Initiative. Following Trump s election Musk found himself on common ground with the new president and his advisers as the president announced plans to pursue massive infrastructure developments.While sometimes at odds with the president s controversial measures such as a proposed ban on immigrants from Muslim majority countries Musk defended his involvement with the new administration. My goals he tweeted in early 2017 are to accelerate the world s transition to sustainable energy and to help make humanity a multi planet civilization a consequence of which will be the creating of hundreds of thousands of jobs and a more inspiring future for all. On June 1 following Trump s announcement that he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate accord Musk stepped down from his advisory roles.Personal LifeWives and ChildrenMusk has been married twice.

What is Elon Musk s Favorite Food No ResultView All ResultNo ResultView All ResultHomeElon MuskWhat is Elon Musk s Favorite Food byBetty Jackson2020 10 06Elon Musk has come a long way since he fed himself on 1 a day and mostly ate oranges and hot dogs. These days he can afford anything he wants to eat. So what would he choose What is Elon Musk s favorite food French food and BBQ. While these are more preparations then particular foods this is his answer when asked the question. The two almost seem at odds with one another as they re kind of at the opposite ends of the preparation stratosphere.While Musk may have given up on oranges and hot dogs one thing he can t give up on is sweets. Many times he s chosen to have aMars bar for breakfast instead of a proper breakfast. As someone who travels around the world for business he has tasted a lot of cuisine.Musk s Eating HabitsElon Musk doesn t really stick to a particular diet. Or really watch what he eats at all. Often times during the day someone will bring him food for lunch and he ll just eat whatever is put in front of him.While he eats Mars bars for breakfast he s not averse to cereal he just prefers it in the middle of the night.Cinnamon Toast Crunchis his favorite to chow down on.How Tall Is Elon Musk Exact Height RevealedDid Elon Musk Grow Up Rich How Did Grimes And Elon Musk Meet In addition to giving up the 1 a day eating diet he s also reduced his caffeine intake previously driving large amounts ofDiet Coke and coffee. He still continues to drink both just a more manageable level of about 3 each a day. Which would still be a lot for some people. Though if I worked as much as Elon Musk did I d probably drink the same amount.Ice cream sundae in a martini glasspic.twitter.com zAVFlOsYkM Elon Musk elonmusk May 13 2020A Family s Lack of InfluenceElon s younger brother Kimbal is almost the complete opposite of him when it comes to food. The brothers have a lot in common when it comes to business as they joined forces to start their first business and have continued to be partners since.Kimbal has less of a visual role in Tesla and SpaceX though sits on the boards of each. He is a professionally trained chef that owns multiple restaurants and eateries. His big focuses are on sustainability and providing access to fresh food to all of America no matter where they are or their circumstance.While not a vegan himself he does have a vegan restaurant and promotes healthy eating. The majority of his fuel comes from vegetables and fish. A stark contrast to his older brother. Elon has helped Kimbal with his initiatives but little brother hasn t been able to influence him to eat a healthier diet.In addition to his brother s healthy eating ways his mother s eating is healthy as well. Supermodel Maye Musk is also a registered dietician and has helped many patients while she was providing for her three children. Again no luck with convincing Elon that perhaps so much junk food isn t good.The Boring Company CandyNot sure if this is actually true or not but Musk talked about it on dates other than April 1st so perhaps there s some validity to it. And thatitis that he s looking tostart a candybrand and or store.I m starting a candy company it s going to be amazing Elon Musk elonmusk May 5 2018He says he s serious and showed a picture of thefirst prototypeon his now deleted Instagram. I wonder what candy created by Elon Musk would taste like. He has said that he would like a cryptocandy but I have no idea what that means or what it would taste like. All I can think of is freeze dried astronaut food.French and BarbequeThough he answered that French and Barbeque are his favorite foods he mostly only talks about junk food so we re not sure if he just gave the answer as it sounded better than ice cream. One thing we know for sure that s not at the top of his list are oranges and hot dogs.AboutCelebrity Name List A Z ContactPrivacy PolicyAdvertise 2020 Black Sands Media All Rights ReservedNo ResultView All ResultHomeAboutCelebrity ListContactAdvertiseOur SitesLuxuryViewerHistoryAnswers 2020 Black Sands Media All Rights Reserved

Musk uses a variation of the Pomodoro technique which is the idea of working on one single task for 25 minutes at a time then taking a five minute break. Repeat this four times and then give yourself a full 30 minute break.Instead of 25 minutes Musk breaks his tasks into five minute periods to help keep him on track and constantly working.Even with an extremely demanding work week Musk at least tries to fit in some time to exercise because he understands how important it is for your overall health and wellness. In an interview onThe Joe Rogan Experiencepodcast Musk states Being overweight is a big deal. Obesity is a public health concern and at leastone in five adults are affected by it.Rogan even points out that being overweight may be one of the larger contributing factors to worsened symptoms of COVID 19. In fact obese individuals with COVID can experience increased risks of hospitalization ICU admission and even death.So it s no wonder why Musk understands the importance of maintaining a healthy weight...even if he doesn t fully practice it.Musk states on Rogan s podcast The older you get you tend to put on more weight. That s happening with me. Muscle mass can decreaseas you age and be replaced with fat increasing the chance of strength and function loss. Musk clearly understands what to do to live a healthy lifestyle but he seems to prefer indulging in foods he enjoys over healthy foods.Elon Musk s Daily Routine and DietAs a teenager Musk challenged himself to live off 1 per day for food and ate meals mostly consisting of hot dogs oranges and pasta. In an interview withBusiness Insider Musk says I would not encourage anyone to live on 1 a day. That would not be super fun. Also I did this back in 1990 so a dollar went a lot further back then. Would be much harder to do that today. Musk may not be living off the bare minimum anymore but that doesn t necessarily mean his eating habits have changed much. If he s eating at all it may not be chicken and veggies.Although Elon Musk s mother Maye Musk is a dietician he prefers tasty food and admits in aReddit AMAthat barbeque and French cuisine are a few of his favorite foods. I d rather eat tasty food and live a shorter life Musk states on Rogan s podcast.Musk doesn t spend too much time eating. He tries to get three meals in a day but said he wished he didn t have to eat and could just absorb nutrients while sitting.Quite often he s skipping breakfastand just having a cup of coffee and maybe an omelet. Breakfast may claim to be the most important meal of the day but for Musk it could mean time wasted where he could be working.For lunch the Tesla CEO is typically scarfing down whateverhe can during meetings as long as it tastes good and can be eaten in five minutes or less. Musk also enjoys drinking Diet Coke despite thenegative effectsit can have on your health.Dinner typically consists of higher calories and he admits to overeating at night. Musk may also indulge in Whiskey his favorite alcohol or wine. However he s sure to eat or drink alcohol no less than two to three hours before bed.Eating too close to your bedtimemay disrupt your digestion and cause heartburn and it can cause you to wake up one or more times during the night.With a typical bedtime of around 1am Musk usually gets around six hours of sleep despiteJeff Bezosensuring that eight hours of sleep is essential for productivity.Elon Musk s Workout RoutineNot everyone has the luxury of affording a personal trainer but the richest man in the world definitely does. However he admits on Rogan s podcast that he hasn t used them in awhile.Musk understands the importance of exercise and does it to keep his stamina and flexibility in his body high as well as his brain sharp.Musk tells Rogan To be totally frank I wouldn t exercise at all if I could. I prefer not to exercise. Although he may not enjoy it Musk typically finds himself doing cardio and lifting weights on his own.Instead of listening to music or a podcast like most of us might on the treadmill Musk turns on a compelling TV show which may help him forget how much he really doesn t like running.Fitness is different for everyone. You may love lifting weights while your best friend may love hopping into a Zumba class. For this billionaire he enjoys fitness mostly in the form of martial arts.Musk has participated in Taekwondo karate judo and Brazilian jiu jitsuand on social media has evenchallenged Vladimir Putin to single combat. He must enjoy jiu jitsu to some extent because even his children have practiced it since a young age.There s no doubt that Elon Musk lives an immensely busy lifestyle but he does find time to exercise once or twice a week.Workout and Diet like a BillionaireAlthough we may not necessarily recommend following the diet and workout routine of billionaire Elon Musk it s important to not restrict yourself of the foods you love and make sure you enjoy your fitness routine.Musk s own advice on Rogan s podcast is Maybe have tasty food but smaller amounts of it. Portion control is a large part of maintaining a healthy diet along with getting enough nutrients and vitamins. Taking a supplement likeVitamin C Liposomalcan help you get some of the essential vitamins needed for your bones skin blood vessels and overall health.Choosing an exercise routine that you truly enjoy whether it s martial arts or running can help keep you motivated and can teach you to love fitness.Elon Musk may not be the perfect example of how to live a healthy lifestyle but he definitely shows us what years of hard work and motivation can do. So whatever your goal is whether it s to win a bodybuilding competition make the leaderboard at your gym or simply be a healthier person you can learn from Elon Musk s work ethic.Useful LinksOur MissionWholesaleLocationsShipping InformationReturns ExchangesTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyProp 65Contact UsTrack my OrderAccessibility Contact InformationContact Us 941 253 5401Se habla espa ol MONDAY FRIDAY9AM EST 5PM EST Support CenterTREND WITH USSee The Latest On Our Instagram Feed And Connect With Us On Facebook Tiktok More. 2023Steel Supplements.

Juneteenth is henceforth considered a US holiday at Tesla SpaceX Musk who is CEO of both tweeted.The tweet initially was met with praise and enthusiasm. Juneteenth a celebration of the emancipation of enslaved people in America that falls on the 19th of June each year has been commemorated in black communitiesfor generations. In recent weeks as people protest the police killings of black Americans an array of institutions and companies have weighed in making a show of wanting to do better including designating Juneteenth which is not a federal holiday as a paid holiday for their employees.But then nearly an hour later Musk added a small clarification. It does require use of a paid time off day which is true of many other holidays hesaid in response to a Twitter user who had applauded Musk for giving his employees a paid holiday.Read The quintessential Americanness of JuneteenthAh.So Juneteenth counted as a holiday only if employees used one of their vacation days. In other words Juneteenth would be just like any other day at the office. When a CEO announces a newly observed holiday at the office especially with language like henceforth one can fairly assume that he intends that holiday to take the usual form company wide and paid. Musk s first tweet thoughtful and well received now seemed like a misleading and perfunctory gesture.A pronouncement of a new company policy on Twitter light on context and apparently without forewarning is a classic Musk play. But the stakes are higher now. Musk sits at the top of companies that are paving the future of technology and space exploration two industries with atroublesometrackrecordon diversity. That position provides him with the power to enact some change. Musk has alreadydisappointedsome of his most ardent fans by pushing for Tesla to reopen last month despite local shutdown orders amid the coronavirus which is disproportionately killing black and brown Americans. Several cases have beenreportedat Tesla s assembly plant in Fremont California. This week in the span of two tweets he fumbled an opportunity on another national concern once again putting his companies in a difficult position.Read American spaceflight is now in Elon Musk s handsThe apparent hollowness of Musk s gesture was only magnified when several news outlets reported that some Tesla employees werealready at workwhen they received the news about the policy. According toBuzzFeed Tesla s head of human resources had notified staff at about 8 a.m. on the West Coast before Musk tweeted that the company fully supports Juneteenth for any U.S. employee that wants to take the day off to celebrate and that for those who chose to take off the day would be recorded as an unpaid PTO an impressive corporate twisting of words.The public reaction to the haphazard rollout seemed to resonate with senior leadership at least at SpaceX. About two hours after Musk s follow up tweet Gwynne Shotwell the company s chief operating officer sent a memo to staff announcing that next year Juneteenth would be an official company holiday CNBCreported. The language suggested but did not explicitly say that Juneteenth would be added to SpaceX s calendar of paid holidays. Musk said later in atweetlate on Friday night that an extra paid time off day would be added to the calendars at SpaceX and Tesla. SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment on this story neither did Tesla. In the email Shotwell said that she had recently met with black employees to discuss their experiences at SpaceX. Microaggressions all the way to explicit race based name calling and other intolerable aggressive behaviors occur here and this is completely not OK she wrote. She announced several new initiatives including employee networks for black and Latino staff and mandatory bias training for all employees. Such training she said was instituted for people leaders last year. Employees she added could still observe Juneteenth for the few hours left in the workday as paid or unpaid time off.Shotwell s apparent rush to address the situation felt to some like a reaction to the public criticism of Musk s walked back declaration an attempt to turn a flimsy effort into something more substantive. It s like when Trump tweets something and people have to scramble to make a policy out of it a former SpaceX engineer who left the company in 2018 and who asked not to be named to avoid professional repercussions told me.Read The cult of Elon is crackingThe recent demonstrations have resurfaced stories of racial harassment and discrimination at Tesla. In the past several years dozens of current and former Tesla employees and contractors have described in lawsuits and news reports a hostile work environment for black workers at the Fremont plant. Tesla officials have denied the various allegations. In late 2018 The New York Timesreportedthat workers of color were subjected to racist taunts assigned menial jobs and overlooked for promotions. A year earlier in response to a lawsuit brought by a former employee whoallegedthat co workers and supervisors had called him the N word Tesla publiclyreleasedan email Musk had sent to all employees with the subject line Doing the right thing that suggested workers should tolerate a certain degree of racist behavior from colleagues. Part of not being a huge jerk is considering how someone might feel who is part of an historically less represented group Musk wrote. But in fairness if someone is a jerk to you but sincerely apologizes it is important to be thick skinned and accept that apology. If you are part of a less represented group you don t get a free pass for being a jerk yourself. He said that Tesla had promoted people from a less represented group over more qualified highly represented candidates in the past and said that those people went on to sue the company anyway. That is obviously not cool he wrote.In the weeks since George Floyd was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis some Tesla employees have grown frustrated with their CEO s public approach to the latest wave of demonstrations against state violence toward black people according toProtocol. Musk has writtena few tweetsin support of bringing the officers involved in Floyd s death to justice but as of Friday hadn t offered any formal addresses about race to his employees. Not looking for a change the world speech but to know your CEO appreciates the immensely diverse company he has created during this time period would be reassuring one worker toldProtocol. On Friday a group of Tesla employees organized a rally in honor of Juneteenth on the grounds of the Fremont plant according toThe Verge.Read Black joy not corporate acknowledgement is the heart of JuneteenthBy seemingly treating Juneteenth as an afterthought Musk isn t helping his brands grapple with an important and painful reckoning in this country. The latest conversation on racism can and has prompted officials at SpaceX and Tesla to consider changes to better support their employees of color but the businesses must still bear the potential negative impacts of Musk s unfiltered online presence which can overshadow other more earnest attempts.As SpaceX and Tesla do the impressive work of launching people into space and revolutionizing the car industry Musk could in his way hold them back on so many important fronts. SpaceX recently made headlines for sending NASA astronauts to space for the first time a tremendous feat that signaleda new era in American spaceflight one that many hope leaves behind the prejudices of the country searlierspacefaring days.It will take far more than a company holiday to address systemic racism in America. As Kellie Carter Jackson an assistant professor of Africana studies at Wellesley College wroteinThe Atlanticon Friday If not followed with substantive change the relatively recent scramble to acknowledge Juneteenth will just feel like virtue signaling acts of solidarity that ring hollow. The former SpaceX engineer I spoke with who is white said that the overwhelming majority of his colleagues at the company were white and male. The engineer hopes SpaceX s newfound recognition of Juneteenth as well as the slew of initiatives that Shotwell announced translates into actual progress in the workforce. If you can land rockets on a barge the former employee said I think you could find a way to hire more black engineers.

I m not buying any sports teams. Elon Musk elonmusk August 17 2022Although if it were any team it would be Man U. They were my fav team as a kid. Elon Musk elonmusk August 17 2022 If it were any team it would be Man U he posted toTwitter using a name for the club many traditional United supporters in England eschew. They were my fav team as a kid. Alas it was all in jest but fans who have endured too many seasons of disappointment got excited by the thought of the deep pocketed CEO rescuing their club from its creeping demise.Despised American ownerThat s because if there s a figure more universally despised by United fans than anyone else in soccer it is Joel Glazer the club s American chairman and owner of the NFL s Tampa Bay Buccaneers.He inherited ownership from his father Malcolm Glazer who acquired United in a 2005 leveraged buyout that saddled the club with a mountain of debt effectively forcing the club to pay for its own acquisition. There s a family over there in America who are just literally letting their employees take all the hits for them and that is unforgivable vented former United player and football commentator Gary Neville following a 0 4 drubbing by lowly Brentford playing in just its second season in the Premier League.He demanded the owners stop hiding in Tampa and address the problems Joe Glazer has got to get in a plane to Manchester tomorrow and he s got to tell everybody what the hell his plan is with the football club. By comparison Chelsea FC supporters spoke well of their Russian oligarch owner Roman Abramovich even through the Ukraine war because of all the money he pumped into the Blues to win titles.United is England s most storied side having scooped up 20 league titles one more than archrival Liverpool 13 of which were won under its totemic former manager Sir Alex Ferguson.It has seen triumph with the last second UEFA Champions League 1999 win over Bayern Munich in stoppage time and endured tragedy with the air disaster of 1958 when the side s plane crashed in Munich killing eight of England s most talented football players.Thanks to its rich and moving history the stadium at Old Trafford ranks along with Real Madrid s Bernabeu and Barcelona s Camp Nou as a pilgrimage site for football fans the world over.Hard timesYet the glory days when fans of the Red Devils were spoiled with silverware are over.With Ferguson s departure in 2013 the club slowly drifted into mediocrity churning through a seemingly never ending slew of managers.Everyone from the strict Dutch schoolmaster Louis van Gaal and United s legendary Welsh midfielder Ryan Giggs to the Special One Jos Mourinho tried their hand at coaching the side only to fall far short of expectations.Not even the return of its former star winger Cristiano Ronaldo after years of goal scoring at Real and Juventus energized the club last season. Already he s pushing to be released from his contract in order to still qualify to compete in Europe s top competition with another team.Worse the club s once pitiful local rival Manchester City has eclipsed it thanks to the coaching skills of Pep Guardiola and the bankroll of its wealthy Emirati owner Sheikh Mansour.Now the Citizens are at the top of the table while United sits dead last and faces relegation to the dreaded second league if it doesn t improve.Fans have for years believed to know who the guilty party is the Glazers.As long as a decade ago a group of wealthy United supporters around formerGoldman Sachsbanker Jim O Neill dubbed the Red Knights sensed that the Glazers were not a safe pair of hands and attempted to wrest control of the club from the American family.That s because the family is widely viewed as locusts asset stripping the club while letting the team staff and facilities fall into a state of neglect.Daily tabloidThe Sunestimated on Tuesday that the Glazers havedrained club coffersto the tune of 1.1 billion pounds 1.3 billion in interest dividends and fees since taking control. The only money that has been spent on players at Manchester United is the money the club has generated or that it s borrowed Neville said on the weekend. It does not come from the families let s get this out of our heads that the Glazer family is putting money in every year like Roman Abramovich did. Maybe Musk can be convinced to buy it in the end money is after all no problem for the world s wealthiest person especially if he can exit his 44 billion takeoverof Twitter.Even if his remark about purchasing United was just in jest he confided in April that he launched his Boring Company as a joke.Reportedly the Glazers are willing to sell.All they are asking for reportedly isjust a tenthof what Musk was prepared to pay for the social media platform.Sign up for theFortune Featuresemail list so you don t miss our biggest features exclusive interviews and investigations.Read MoreUkraine InvasionCybersecurityEnergyTravel IndustryAutosMost PopularFinanceA professional couple who make over 200 000 combined say it s hilarious to think they could afford a home in Los...April 10 2023BYAlena BotrosHealth Arcturus a highly transmissible COVID variant eyed by the WHO appears to have a new symptom.

Another company that owns the New York Rangers NHL and New York Knicks NBA is also considering a partial sale of the teams.What Happened Manchester United PLC NYSE MANU went public in 2012 but remained under the control of the Glazer family who purchased the team in 2005. For years rumors of a buyout of the team popped up including the rumor started by Elon Musk. Although if it were any team it would be Man U. They were my fav team as a kid Musk tweeted.While Musk didn t end up buying the team he might have inadvertently kickstarted talks of team management to explore a sale.Soccer agentJon Smithsaid in August 2022 that he believed a sale of Manchester United would happen within the next 24 months. Soccer reportLuca Bonaititweeted the Glazers seemed more open to selling the team if they failed to qualify for the Champions League and the family had never been this open to selling before. In November 2022 Manchester United formally announced its board of directors was exploring strategic alternatives for the club. As part of this process the Board will consider all strategic alternatives including new investment into the club a sale or other transactions involving the company the team said.Interested parties includeJim RatcliffeandMichael Knighton. Formula 1 driverLewis Hamiltonwas also linked with teaming up on a bid.Shares of Manchester United rose this week on new reports that high wealth individuals in Qatar were interested in buying the team. A report from the Daily Mail said this could include a massive offer for the team as early as next week for the team which was called one of football s crown jewels. PA Sport journalistJamie Gardnertweeted Wednesday that Qatari Sports Investments was the group interested in Manchester United. The investment group was considering investments in other Premier League teams and might only bid for a minority stake.The deadline for bids on Manchester United by the Glazer family was reported to be mid February.New York Knicks and Rangers Join Sales Talks Along with the ongoing sale process for Manchester United another publicly traded sports team could be up for sale or at least a portion of it.In this case the sports team is actually two withMadison Square Garden Sports Corp NYSE MSGS owning both the Knicks and Rangers.MSG Sports President and COODavid Hopkinsonshare that the company was open to selling a partial stake in one or both of the legendary sports franchises according to Sportico. We have no plan to sell either team Hopkinson said during the company s earnings call Tuesday. No current plans there but we certainly won t rule out the possibility of selling a minority stake in the Knicks or Rangers. Hopkinson highlighted new rules from the NBA that allowed private equity investors and sovereign wealth funds to invest in teams.Private equity company Silver Lake owns around 10 of MSG Sports and had been interested previously in owning a larger stake in the company.Why It s Important Even with shares of Manchester United up 72 in the last year the company could be undervalued compared to where a potential sale price could land. The team was valued at 4.6 billion and 4.7 billion by Forbes and Sportico respectively.The company has a current market capitalization of 3.4 billion and an enterprise value of 4.2 billion.Reports said the Glazer family was looking for something more in the 5 billion to 7 billion range to sell the team.Benzinga previously calculated the sale range between 4.65 billion and 8.28 billion based on team valuations and multiples on recent sports team sales.The Knicks and Rangers have valuations of 6.5 billion and 2 billion from Sportico respectively. Both team valuations include Madison Square Garden where the teams play. This asset is owned byMadison Square Garden Entertainment Corp NYSE MSGE .There has been a limited amount of public sports teams over the years giving limited access to investors to invest in the success of teams and professional sports leagues.Two of the public sports teams could be acquired and exit stock exchanges.Coincidentally enough Ted Leonsis who owns the Washington Wizards and Washington Capitals said recently that a significant number of teams will go public in 2023 according to Sportico reporterEben Novy Williams.MANU MSGS Price Action At market close Wednesday Manchester United shares were up 10.51 to 23.34 versus a 52 week range of 10.41 to 25.24.Madison Square Garden Sports shares were up 3.82 to 188.76 versus a 52 week range of 130.61 to 188.88.Read Next Ryan Reynolds Could Be Buying This NHL Team Could Deadpool Actor Be The Latest Celebrity Team Owner Photo stockphoto mania via ShutterstockSHARE THIS POSTFACEBOOKTWITTEREMAILCOPY LINKMadison Square Garden Entertainment NewsMOREMSG Entertainment agrees to settle merger lawsuit for 48.5MSeeking Alpha5dAnalysts Opinions Are Mixed on These Services Stocks Celularity CELU and Madison Square Garden Entertainment MSGE TipRanks8dWhy Tivic Health Systems Are Trading Lower By 55 Here Are Other Stocks Moving In Thursday s Mid Day SessionBenzinga62dMGM Resorts Madison Square Garden Entertainment Cardiovascular Systems And Other Big Stocks Moving Higher On ThursdayBenzinga62dMSG Entertainment stock climbs on Q2 earnings beatSeeking Alpha62dMadison Square Garden Clocks 24 Revenue Growth In Q2 Updates On Proposed Spin Off Employee DownsizingBenzinga62dMadison Square Garden Entertainment MSGE Tops Q2 Earnings and Revenue EstimatesZacks62dMadison Square Garden Entertainment GAAP EPS of 1.95 beats by 0.81 revenue of 642.2M beats by 40.71MSeeking Alpha62dStart Trading Plus500. 86 of retail CFD accounts lose moneyRelated StocksMSGE58.460.44 0.76 4 11 2023DisclaimerGet real time MSGE charts here MANU22.56 0.13 0.57 02 34 13 AMDisclaimerGet real time MANU charts here MSGS198.224.27 2.20 4 11 2023DisclaimerGet real time MSGS charts here MOREFind NewsNewsGOFollow us on See also IndicesDow JonesS P 500Nasdaq 100Nasdaq CompositeFTSE 100Nikkei 225DAX 40Hang SengKospiS P TSX Composite IndexASXUS Dollar IndexStock IndicesDow FuturesDow Jones Market MoversCommoditiesGold PriceOil PriceSilver PriceCopper PriceCotton PriceHeating Oil PriceAluminum PriceNatural Gas PriceRealtime Commodity PricesCurrenciesEURO DOLLARBitcoin PriceETH USDCAD USDPESO USDPOUND USDUSD INRCurrency ConverterExchange RatesStocksGoogle StockMeta StockAmazon StockTesla StockDow StockPremarketStock Market NewsSeemore Exploremorecategories 2023Insider Inc. andfinanzen.netGmbH Imprint .

The car is a gift from her sonElon Musk the Tesla C.E.O. and arguably the most famous inventor entrepreneur of his generation. But my friends tell me I was famous before Elon was famous she says flashing a smile that suddenly looks familiar from a Target billboard in Times Square a campaign for Virgin America and Beyonc s video for her song Haunted. Musk s life storyreads like a stylish adventure book. She was born Maye Haldeman in Regina Saskatchewan in 1948 to explorer parents who had met when her father a caretaker came to take lessons with her mother a ballroom dancing instructor. When Musk was nearly three the family including her three siblings moved to Pretoria South Africa. She started modeling at 15 when models had to have their own shoes and jewelry and was a finalist in the 1969 Miss South Africa contest. By 21 she had earned a bachelor s in dietetics and she would go on to juggle nutritional clients with fashion shoots. She married Errol Musk an engineer in 1970 had three kids Elon has a younger brother Kimbal and a sister Tosca but divorced him nine years later and followed her children as they left apartheid South Africa for careers in North America. Elon s nickname was genius boy though she s quick to add All my kids are brilliant. Kimbal created the Kitchen a family of farm to table restaurants and Tosca is a filmmaker. Maye moved to Toronto then New York and in 2013 settled in Marina del Rey California to be near the grandkids.Lately the fashion world has been paying more attention to the five decade model. I m living proof that you can find work for an older woman . . . I ve never worked so much as I do now Musk says proudly. The jobs have evolved from mother of the bride commercials to mother of Elon editorials which doesn t bother her one bit I don t care why a client books me as long as they book me.

She showed up in a bubblegum pink sheath dress her short silver hair combed into a sleek pompadour and makeup meticulously done and greeted me with a magazine perfect smile. She ordered an avocado toast with coffee. I love bread she said.The 71 year old fashion model and dietician holds numerous records throughout her 50 year career she was the only plus size model in South Africa in the 1970s as well as one of the oldest models in the country during a time when the industry was dominated by teens and early twenty somethings. In 2015 Maye was signed by American modeling giant IMG at age 67 and became the oldest spokesperson for CoverGirl two years later at 69. Outside the fashion world she s also known as themother of Elon Musk the founder ofTeslaandSpaceX.SEE ALSO Rebecca Minkoff Reveals Her Ideal Look for Millennial WomenMaye is proud when people take notice of her last name and often takes the opportunity to spread good words about her two other children Kimbal Musk a chain restaurateur and Tosca Musk a filmmaker and media entrepreneur. But she makes an intentional effortnotto reinforce the impression of herself as merely a celebrity mom who feeds on her famous son. When we go to work events people are more amazed byher said Maye s manager. Her energy her positivity her beauty and her fashion which is always a stopper. For the past few weeks Maye and her team have been flying to major cities all over the world to promote her new book A Woman Makes a Plan an autobiographical self help guide backed by personal stories and lessons learned from a turbulent life spanning seven decades.Last month she was in Shanghai China whereTeslarecently opened itsfirst overseas Gigafactoryand Elon is a household name. You d think people would be all over Tesla and Elon with the big factory opening. But no they didn t ask about him much Maye said.Not that people in her professional circle follow electric vehicle developments and rocket science closely anyway. People in fashion just couldn t care less her manager joked.Maye Musk became the oldest spokesperson for CoverGirl in 2017 at age 69.Mike Coppola Getty Images for COVERGIRLWith her enviable upright posture and not a shred of sagging muscle on her face Maye oozes all the glamour and glitz one would imagine from a supermodel and wellness guru. Her book however is filled with unglamorous stories about fighting adversaries and starting over from rock bottom. When I told Elon Kimbal and Tosca that I was going to write a book they all said If you are writing a book you have to talk about your struggles Maye said because they all went through it with me. Maye was born in Canada in 1948 and moved with her family to Pretoria South Africa at a very young age. Along with her adventurous parents she grew up roaming the Kalahari Desert every winter in search of the Lost City of the Kalahari and traveling the world in a single engine prop plane. I was never afraid on my trips to the desert because my dad and mom were in charge Maye wrote in the book. Even when I was told a hyena could bite off my face I just closed my sleeping bag so that the hyena couldn t We learned to live without all the comforts of home. When that s what you have to do it s what you do. In 1970 Maye married Errol Musk a South African engineer at 22 and gave birth to Elon Kimbal and Tosca over the three ensuing years. Her marriage hit a dead end not long after and the couple divorced in 1979. Maye moved with the kids from Pretoria to Durban to run away from my husband she said.At 31 Maye found herself a single mom new in town with three young children. She managed to raise them with an at home dietician practice and a part time modeling job. Money was tight. But life was good with family around. We d buy second hand clothes. We couldn t afford to go out and eat. I fed them peanut butter sandwiches. My kids loved it They didn t know they were deprived she recalled.Things took a heartbreaking turn in the early 1980s when Elon and Kimbal moved to stay with their father as a result of one of many nasty custody lawsuits between Maye and her ex husband. He had different things to sue me about every year. Within one week after every trial I d receive a subpoena for the next one. It just never stopped Maye said. When Elon was about 10 years old he said he s going to go live with his dad. His father had theEncyclopaedia Britannica which I couldn t afford. He also had a computer which was very rare at the time. That s why Elon loved it. Elon Musk and his mother Maye Musk in 1995.Courtesy of Maye MuskWhen Elon was young I noticed that he read everything Elon remembered everything he read. He was always absorbing information. We called Elon the encyclopedia because he had read the Encyclopedia Britannica and Colliers Encyclopedia and remembered everything. That s also why we called him Genius Boy. We could ask him anything. Remember this was before the internet. I guess now we would call him the internet. A Women Makes a PlanMaye s post divorce legal war dragged on for a few more years until Elon and his younger siblings started their adult lives. By 1989 Maye and all her three children had moved to Canada.Maye now lives in Los Angeles and travels frequently for modeling gigs and her consulting practice. She drives a Tesla Model S and watchesSpaceX rocket launcheswhenever she can and gets nervous every time.When asked what she thinks of Elon s plan toretire on Marsone day she pondered for a few seconds and said he can do whatever he wants. The adventurous blood runs deep in the Musk family. Both Maye s parents as well as her ex husband s were self made entrepreneurs. So are all of her four siblings and three children. Maye s older brother Scott Haldeman is a neurologist and founder of World Spine Care an industry nonprofit her younger brother Lee heads a business school in South Africa and her two sisters Lynne and Kaye like their mother run dancing schools. Our family motto was live dangerously carefully Maye wrote. My father sought adventure but he knew to be ready for the unexpected. Because of that I m always curious and willing to explore. And I know that I can take a risk as long as I m prepared. Any plan for her own retirement Nooo Maye responded almost dismissively. My mother didn t retire until 96. She s in a wheelchair now but still reads voraciously every day.
