Ever wonder how she fuels those powerful serves? So did we, which is why we went right to the source, to ask one of the two most famous sisters in tennis about how she eats, how she cooks, and what victory truly tastes like.Is there a Williams-family signature dish?Serena Williams: That's easy: My mom's chicken, with rice and gravy. It was my favorite dish as a kid, and it still is now. That's my favorite meal from her or from anybody. I was just competing in Australia, and she was going to make it for me, but she forgot. Now she owes me! It's a family favorite. But there are more. Venus cooks a lot. My other two other sisters cook. For years, I was always making gumbo for everyone. My other go-to dishes are something I call a "seven-bean delight," which really only has five beans, but don't tell. Everyone loves my roasted chicken with garlic; for a minute, it was my turkey tacos. Now it's vegan sushi. I just love to cook!Can you recite one of those recipes by heart?SW: The easiest is my roasted chicken recipe. I make it French style. I put whole cloves of garlic all over the dish. Some under the skin, some inside the chicken, some inside the pan. I put butter on top of the bird, and butter inside the gut. It's not a light dish! I add only a little salt and pepper, not too much. Then I throw small baby onions everywhere, drizzle olive oil on top and roast away.Is there a cookbook you're obsessed with?SW: My go-to cookbook is called Eat Yourself Sexy! I've been eating a lot healthier for my sister [Ed note: This is because of Venus's Sjogren Syndrome] so the cookbook has all these raw meals, green juices, and smoothies. For me, "green" used to mean "yuck." But I've incorporated a lot of raw things in my diet this year. Venus calls us "chegan"—because we cheat with a little bit of fish and chicken.If you could eat a meal cooked by any chef in the world, who would it be?SW: My mom! I grew up watching my mom in the kitchen, that's how I know anything about cooking. I've always wanted to go to a culinary class actually. Besides my mom, I love Bobby Flay, Emeril, Morimoto—that guy is awesome.What are your favorite Wimbledon eats?SW: For Wimbledon, our chef, Lauren Von Der Pool, travels with us because I try to eat really healthy at that one. No roasted chicken on that trip for me. We have either her or my mom make our meals around match time. Unfortunately, there's no real "restaurant-hopping" when I'm away. Truthfully, I don't eat a lot before my matches. I can't eat because I get too nervous. I'll force myself to really carb up the night before, especially later on in the tournament, because I know I wont be able to eat in the morning. But carbing-up doesn't mean pasta—I'm more into brown rice or sprouted quinoa.What do you eat once you win?SW: Celebration food is always my mom's chicken. I request it every time, along with her biscuits.Are you a sweet or savory person?SW: I'm the deadliest of both: savory and sweet. I love those molten lava cakes, the ones where you cut into it and the chocolate spills out. Even if it's terrible, I can't say no to those. The best ones are at Nobu because they serve it with green tea ice cream. Ridiculously delicious.If you could get an endorsement deal from any food, what would it be?SW: Oh my god, I don't know! Okay. I love moon pies. If "Moon Pie" sponsored me, I'd be bigger than any house on this planet! I love the originals: banana, chocolate, or vanilla. Now I really want a Moon Pie!Describe your last dinner party.SW: I cook for my family a lot, but I've only thrown one proper dinner party, and it was when I was in my gumbo stage. I made a fish-based gumbo because I don't eat red meat or pork. It was basically seared barramundi with mangoes over quinoa, and kale with a mustard sauce on the side.What's your ideal dinner party music?SW: Either soft '90s or jazz. John Coltrane, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and you can't play jazz without Miles Davis.If you could cook dinner for anyone, who would it be and what would you serve?SW: Arthur Ashe and Althea Gibson, because they were black and played tennis, and that wasn't popular in their time. Both are dead now, but I'd really love to have them over. I'd just make a quick salad so we could talk and talk.What does victory taste like?SW: Victory is very, very sweet. It tastes better than any dessert you've ever had.Do you drink?SW: I'm very much a glass-of-wine girl. I love Cabernets, and most French wines. But I'm not a wine snob—I'm cool with a $7 bottle of Riesling from the local Publix.Where is your dream eating trip?SW: I have to say: South Carolina. I love the Southern palate. Those southern meals, there's nothing like it. I'm always eating really healthy now, so I dream of those.What's always in your fridge?SW: My fridge is really just vegan: coconut water, Gatorade (my favorite!), cucumbers, mint, kale, vegetables, ginger, and wheat grass.What foods do you detest?SW: I hate avocados. The texture is so yucky in my mouth. I don't love tomatoes, but if they're diced up I can get them down. And while I really love Japanese food, I can't do those fish eggs that are really fat, big, and orange. I don't like those.How do you eat when flying?SW: These days, I bring a green drink for the plane and something like a wrap with sprouts and fake-tuna made of walnuts. It's actually really, really good!Do you have a food philosophy?SW: You put out what you put in. In other words, just because I get all this exercise, it doesn't mean I don't have to think about it.Explore Bon AppétitFamilyHealthyInterviewsRead MorecookingThe Secret to Juicier Turkey Burgers Is Grated ButterBy Alexis deBoschnekcooking12 Ways to Add Garlic Scapes to Your Spring Cooking RoutineBy Emily SaladinocookingDon’t You Dare Throw Out That Artichoke MarinadeBy Ali FrancisshoppingThe Best Dutch Oven for Every BudgetBy Alex BeggsRecipes you want to make.

Serena Williams said she's retiring from playing pro tennis once she plays the US Open this month.
One thing that will live on is the fierce competitor's legendary diet.
Here's what the 23-time Grand Slam champ likes to eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.



 







 



Before a game, Williams "usually can't" eat and says it may be down to nerves. But if she was going to have a meal, it would be a "protein and carb" combo like turkey sausage and baked potato.

When Williams is away from the court, she might order a delicious and healthy-looking platter for breakfast including smoothies and fruits.







Wonderful breakfast at one of my favorite spots #villard. Thanks! @newyorkpalace A post shared by  Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) on May 1, 2017 at 6:18am PDTMay 1, 2017 at 6:18am PDT
 






 



It's not all clean-eating, though. Williams has an obvious sweet tooth and won't hesitate to put away a beignet, which is basically a deep-fried nugget of sugary dough.







 A post shared by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams)Nov 28, 2017 at 5:26pm PST
 






 



When it comes to lunches, or general snacking, Williams never refuses a taco — and they are an ever-present feature of the tennis champion's Instagram.







 A post shared by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams)Oct 4, 2016 at 5:37am PDT
 






 



Williams once said on Facebook: "I want tacos. Everyday I want tacos. I don't know what to do? Is there help for someone that wants to eat tacos everyday?"










                                                  Shutterstock

If tacos aren't on the menu and Williams wanted to celebrate a tennis success, she has said she would order a cheese pizza and french fries.










                                                  Shutterstock

But sometimes nothing beats home cooking and, for Williams, that means her mother's chicken, rice, and gravy.










                                                  Shutterstock

If Williams is doing the cooking, then she likes to wow her friends and family with a number of dishes. "For years I was always making gumbo for everyone," she told Bon Appétit. "My other go-to dishes are something I call a 'seven-bean delight' which really only has five beans, but don't tell. And roasted chicken with garlic."










                                                  Shutterstock

Aside from tacos, there is another food Williams is obsessed with — moon pie. "I love moon pies," she told Bon Appétit. "If 'Moon Pie' sponsored me, I'd be bigger than any house on this planet! I love the originals: banana, chocolate, or vanilla. Now I really want a Moon Pie!"







Why oh why am I so in love with you dear Mr. Moon Pie? A post shared by  Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) on Apr 1, 2012 at 8:28pm PDTApr 1, 2012 at 8:28pm PDT

Serena Williams may be retiring from playing pro tennis, but her love for tacos and moon pie will forever live on.

Serena Williams








 


Former World No.1 Serena Williams follows a really strict diet when she is playing at different tournaments. She does the same in order to focus completely on her game during tennis events. However, there are some food items that she loves to eat all day and have become some of her favorite. 



Serena Williams’ favorite victory meal is Pizza. She has admitted on many occasions that she loves to eat a slice after winning a major or a tournament. Besides this, she just craves Tacos and one might even see a number of pictures of the dish on her social media accounts.

As far as beverages are concerned, Serena likes to drink Wine, Coconut Water, and Gatorade. In deserts, she has a liking towards Chocolate Lava Cake and the Moon Pies.
There are a number of things that Serena dislikes as well. The list includes the likes of Tomatoes, Peanuts, and Red Meat.



Serena Williams’s Everyday Diet 
Serena Williams
Serena takes breakfast early and it is usually a simple one consisting of oats. They are generally nourished with strawberries and almond butter to add some flavor to them. Apart from them, she takes some supplements that help her in boosting her body metabolism.
Her lunch largely comprises of green salad. One can see a mix of Spinach, Lettuce, Cucumbers, Mandarin Oranges, Onions, Pita Croutons, and Peeled Almonds. Along with this, she drinks some Lemon juice to keep herself fresh.



Her last meal of the day, dinner, is heavy and easy to digest. It often consists of brown rice, salad, and a lot of freshly cooked vegetables.



This is how Serena Williams‘ follows a well-planned vegan diet on a regular basis. It is because of this reason that she is not only competing at the age of 39 but winning titles as well.

What Serena Williams Typically Eats In A Day





Getty Images 
By Brittany Brolley/Updated: July 20, 2021  12:59 pm EST

Serena Williams seems to exude body confidence from every fiber of her being. Seriously, does it come from her pores? Despite being a fantastic role model for women, she doesn't always feel that way. In fact, she feels unconfident in her body more often than not.


"Unless I'm eating really healthy," Williams explained to Fitness Magazine (via Sports Illustrated) "I feel [less than confident] almost every other week." The four-time Olympic gold tennis champion confessed that there are plenty of times when she wishes she could "do better" or "be smaller." She pointed to the way women are taught to look as the reason for these feelings. 
Still, Williams has adopted a healthier lifestyle, but not necessarily to get skinnier — it was for her former roommate. "It all started because I didn't want to bring bad food into the house. I live with my sister, Venus, who has Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease," Williams candidly told the magazine. Williams also found out that she is allergic to wheat, prompting her to adopt a new style of eating. So, just what does a typical menu look like for this tennis star? Keep on reading.





She rarely eats breakfast

As part of her initiative to eat healthier, Serena Williams said she's "trying to eat a clean diet of natural, raw foods."  Nevertheless, she finds it difficult to wake up early and scarf down a healthy breakfast. In a 2017 Vanity Fair profile of Williams, the tennis star is described as "not a morning person" and one that "usually doesn't eat breakfast."

The night before Williams' first match at the Italian Open, however, was a different story. Williams was actually going to try the breakfast buffet at the Cavalieri hotel in Rome. Can you blame her? Unfortunately for the tennis star, the buffet closed just five minutes before she sat down. But, in a twist of fate, Williams ended up choosing a table beside the pool to order a sit-down meal. This is where Williams would meet her eventual husband and father of her child, Alexis Ohanian. Aww. Williams must be thankful that she was in the mood for breakfast that morning.




She strives to eat protein and carbs

Just as Serena Williams finds it difficult to eat breakfast, she also struggles with eating before a match. When asked about her pre-match go-to grub, Williams revealed the truth to Glamour, saying, "Usually I can't [eat]. And I haven't been able to figure out why — it must be nerves!"

In her last match prior to her interview with the magazine, she explained that she did choke back "some turkey sausage and a baked potato" before competing. If you're wondering if Williams opts for turkey sausage because it's regarded as healthier, that might not necessarily be the determining factor for the tennis star. "I'm not really into pork," Williams later added.
Although she finds eating before a match hard to do, she appreciates the power of the all-important combo: protein and carbs. When she is successful at convincing herself to eat before competing, this is the formula she tries to follow. "Tries" being the operative word, of course.




Becoming a 'vega-tarian'




Shutterstock 

Serena Williams may sometimes opt for animal protein, but she's also begun embracing veganism. Well, perhaps pseudo-veganism. After having a baby, Williams told The New York Times that she wanted to "lean out" and, in doing so, knew she had to eat healthier. "I went vegan for 44 days," said Williams. Because it worked so well for her, she decided to try it again. She clarified, saying, "But now, I'm vega-tarian." Williams explained how she loves European cheeses and, since she planned to head to Europe soon, she decided she'll indulge in the dairy product and explore the middle ground between being a vegetarian and a vegan. 

Williams' sister has also started following a loosely vegan diet. "Venus calls us 'chegan' — because we cheat with a little bit of fish and chicken," Williams told Bon Appétit. Williams didn't always appreciate a plant-based diet, though. "For me, green' used to mean 'yuck.' But I've incorporated a lot of raw things in my diet this year," she said.




What happens in South Carolina stays in South Carolina




Shutterstock 

Serena Williams may be a mostly-vegetarian and an overall healthy eater, but that doesn't mean she's going to give up her favorite foods. When speaking to Fitness Magazine (via Sports Illustrated), Williams put it simply, saying, "I love Southern food." Williams loves it so much that she says she doesn't even attempt to eat healthy when in South Carolina for the Family Circle Cup tournament. And when she says she doesn't try, she really, really means that.

"I eat shrimp and grits with butter on top, fried chicken, and, oh, do I eat the fried hush puppies! And the banana pudding — mmm, mmm, mmm! I let myself go that whole week and then another week after that," Williams detailed.
While that kind of diet sounds amazing, quite frankly, it's certainly worth remembering that Williams works out insanely hard, with tennis matches lasting for hours at a time. And even so, she said she "can't take cheat days too often because [her] cheat days are usually cheat months!" We feel you, Serena.




Celebratory pizza — hold the pepperoni




Shutterstock 

Even though Serena Williams has a hard time eating before a match, the same does not apply as soon as the match is finished. And if she happens to win said match, the meal she chooses may be a little less than healthy. Pizza, for instance, is her preferred celebratory meal. She's not usually one for fancy toppings and instead specified to Glamour that she likes to eat it plain — "just cheese." Williams' favorite pizza comes from Bella Vita, a pizzeria based out of, you guessed it, New York.

Williams may try to limit her cheat days to when she's visiting the southern states, but she still finds a way to eat things that many would consider to be far from diet-friendly. "I had fries with lunch today," Williams admitted. Although, she did make it a point not to eat them all. "But I'm not going to deprive myself," she clarified. You do you, girl!




Winner, winner, chicken dinner




Instagram 

As a sometimes-vegetarian, sometimes-not, Serena Williams likely still eats chicken now and again. Her mom's "chicken, with rice and gravy" is William's favorite dish — and has been since she was a young child. Even as an adult, she asks her mom to make up a batch for her. "I was just competing in Australia, and she was going to make it for me, but she forgot. Now she owes me!" Williams told Bon Appétit in 2013. 

The tennis superstar also has her own roast chicken recipe. "I make it French style," she explained. Williams uses whole garlic cloves, placing some under the skin and inside the chicken. "I put butter on top of the bird, and butter inside the gut," Williams said, revealing her recipe. She clarified, saying, "It's not a light dish!" With a little salt and pepper, baby onions, and olive oil, Williams roasts the chicken. Vegan or not, it sounds delicious!




Her tastes are ever-changing




Shutterstock 

Roasted chicken dinners are not the only thing Serena Williams cooks. "For years, I was always making gumbo for everyone," she told Bon Appétit. Then she started making "seven-bean delight." Williams came clean and said that it actually only has five beans. "But don't tell," she joked. For a while, turkey tacos were her go-to, but now as she transitions to a more vegan-centric diet, she makes "vegan sushi."

Williams told of her love of cooking, which she feels she got from her family. "I grew up watching my mom in the kitchen, that's how I know anything about cooking," said Williams. Despite being a world-renowned athlete, culinary classes are something she's always been interested in taking up. For now, though, the star learns from watching her mom and celebrity chefs, like Emeril Lagassé, Bobby Flay, and Masaharu Morimoto. "That guy is awesome," Williams remarked. Imagine being called awesome by none other than Serena Williams? Life goals.




You'll never catch her eating these foods




Shutterstock 

Serena Williams keeps a well-stocked and healthy fridge. Mostly all vegan, Williams told Bon Appétit that you'd find "coconut water, Gatorade ([her] favorite!), cucumbers, mint, kale, vegetables, ginger, and wheat grass" if you were to peer inside. There are a few things you'll never, ever see Williams eating though.

"I hate avocados," the champion admitted. What? Serena, no! "The texture is so yucky in my mouth," she explained. Okay, maybe we'll give her a free pass. Williams listed off several other foods she's not a fan of, including tomatoes. If diced into small pieces, Williams says she "can get them down," but eating tomatoes is obviously not the most enjoyable experience for her. 
Despite liking the majority of Japanese food, Williams said there's one Japanese cuisine she just can't handle. "I can't do those fish eggs that are really fat, big, and orange. I don't like those," she added. Wait — does this mean there are people who do actually like eating those? 




She's a tacoholic




Shutterstock 

For being the driven and dedicated super-fit athlete we all know and love, Serena Williams has proven that even she has to find the balance between eating healthy and eating not so healthy. She also battles food cravings — on the daily. 

"I want tacos. Everyday I want tacos," Williams wrote in a Facebook post, "I don't know what to do? Is there help for someone that wants to eat tacos everyday?" While the first step may be to admit you have a problem, Tacoholics Anonymous isn't yet a thing. Williams explained why she's so obsessed with the food to USA Today, saying, "I grew up next to all of these Mexican families and we were close with them when I was little, we were friends. I think that's where my love for tacos comes from." Williams also claims to make the best tacos, but joked, saying, "I don't taco about it."
With Serena Williams' otherwise healthy eating plan, you probably don't have to worry about her taco addiction too much. Besides, it's nacho problem.

By Jasmine GomezPublished: Aug 28, 2021Save ArticleNintendoWhen it comes to winning tennis matches, my money's on the woman whose name is synonymous with the sport. Clearly, the only right answer here is Serena Williams. With 39 Grand Slam titles in total, she's one of the most decorated tennis players of all time. Getting to GOAT status obviously requires years and years of training and perfecting your craft, but there are so many more moving parts that go into it, too—the right team, the right gear, and more importantly, the right diet. More From Women's Health play iconThe triangle icon that indicates to playSerena looks at food as fuel. "My philosophy is eat to live. Don't live to eat," she tells Women's Health during a Nintendo gaming event. "I want to have a healthy lifestyle and, so you know, [I'm eating] a lot of greens and mostly plant-based lately, just super healthy stuff." Related StorySerena Williams And Daughter Honor Flo-JoShe says that this philosophy allows her to see food as a complement, and not her entire life. "You need it to survive. And [that's] very hard to live by, cause I definitely love to snack, but this is what I want. These are my goals." This content is imported from poll. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.Though she has access to plenty of prepared meals to help her meet those healthy goals, Serena also doesn't mind throwing down in the kitchen when she can. "I love cooking. I don't have a ton of time to do it often, but I love cooking and it's just kind of relaxing for me."So if you're wondering exactly what Serena eats on the reg, here's what her daily menu looks like. BreakfastEven though Serena likes to stick to a plant-based diet, she occasionally eats eggs in the morning. But she really isn't a huge breakfast person. "I often don't make breakfast because I just forget or I'm running around getting Olympia ready," she says. "And then I go work out." She prefers waiting until she's hungry to have her first meal. And for her, that's typically not until later in the day. "When I roll out of bed [in the morning], I'm just not hungry."View full post on InstagramLunch It depends on what she feels like that day, but her mid-day meal usually involves greens and protein. "I had a bean burger the other day today. [Before our interview], I had a gluten-free bean burrito," Serena says.

She's never really liked either.DinnerWhat she eats for dinner also depends on what she and her fam feel like eating. But she's a fan of Taco Tuesdays. And just like you or me, she turns to social media for meal-planning inspo. "I get inspired by what I see on Instagram," she says, "and I love making it." She's already mastered chia seed pudding, chocolate cake, and this impressive rainbow cake:View full post on InstagramPre-GameWhen it comes to fueling before her matches, it's all about carb-loading the night before with foods like rice or pasta. "The only time I eat pasta is when I'm playing/training. Usually, you'll never see me eating pasta otherwise. 'Cause I feel like I've had to eat it so much in my career. It's just like, I never want to see pasta again," she says jokingly. Her diet actually has a distinct personality.  "I can have a smoothie for six months," she says. "And then I'll be like, I never want to see a smoothie again for the next six months. And then I'll be like, okay, I'm back on the smoothie. My eating is very moody." Related StorySerena Williams And Daughter Honor Flo-JoRight before games, though, she has a go-to plate. "I usually like to have lots of greens before my match and then fruit actually, and a little carbs and some sort of a protein. So I try to knock them [her food groups] all out in one."SnacksSerena says she loves to snack. She actually told Insider that she's obsessed a certain sweet treat. "I love moon pies. If "Moon Pie" sponsored me, I'd be bigger than any house on this planet! I love the originals: banana, chocolate, or vanilla." View full post on InstagramBut you won't catch her snacking while she's playing with her Nintendo Switch, and for good reason. "My hands are always occupied and there's no way to snack. I mean, I'll lose."

(Follow @alyroe on Twitter).Follow on TwitterFacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerPinterestEmailprintThis story was originally published on Sept. 8, 2016. Serena Williams has made history. With a win over her older sister Venus in the final of the Australian Open on Jan. 28, Williams holds more Grand Slam titles than any player in the Open era. To win a title, a player must win seven matches over two weeks on the sport's greatest stages and against its most dominant players. Williams, 35, has done so 23 times in 66 Grand Slam appearances and has surpassed Steffi Graf's Open era record of 22. Now that she has reached 23, the buzz turns to Margaret Court's all-era record of 24, and history beckons again.Such has been the career of Serena Williams, built of milestones upon milestones, as she became the first, the fastest, the winningest. For more than two decades, she has captivated our attention and confounded our ability to easily package her enigmatic personality. She is complicated and contradictory, fierce and shy, intense yet vulnerable. Those who know her best say it's this internal turbulence that has driven her to rise from moments of despair and continue to chase excellence in a sport she has come to define, while pursuing happiness in a life that regularly tests her ability to overcome.As she continues her historic 2017 season, we offer an oral history, through more than 20 interviews with her friends, family, competitors and coaches, of the lessons, experiences, hardships and successes that have crafted Williams into the greatest competitor the sport of tennis has ever seen.PART ONE: THE PRODIGYPART TWO: THE BEGINNING OF THE WINNINGPART THREE: THE HARD YEARSPART FOUR: THE BREAKPART FIVE: THE ROAD TO 23Louisa BertmanPART ONE: THE PRODIGYSEPT. 26, 1981Serena Jameka Williams is born in Saginaw, Michigan, to Richard Williams and Oracene Price. It's a Saturday.Oracene Price (mother): "What I remember about the day Serena was born is that she was a 10 ½-pound baby. But she wasn't a hard delivery, my youngest daughter."Isha Price (sister): "We didn't know if Serena was going to be a boy or a girl. My sisters and I were at our grandmother's house. We weren't allowed to go to the hospital, and I remember wishing and hoping we had a little brother. I remember the phone call and our grandmother calling us into one room and saying 'You have another baby sister.' I was a little disappointed."The youngest of five girls, Serena embraces the role of little sis. Growing up, she shares a bedroom and two sets of bunk beds with her siblings -- Lyndrea and Venus on the two lower bunks, and Isha and Yetunde on the upper bunks. Each night, Serena crawls into bed with a different sister. When it comes to her older sisters, Serena always gets her way. Isha: "We would have these family talent shows, and Serena always had to win. She always sang the same song, 'Greatest Love of All' by Whitney Houston. Even if she sounded like screeching tires, she won. That's what we had to do or she would throw a tantrum and cry. We didn't want to deal with the repercussions of her not winning."Oracene: "With Serena, everything had to be perfect and she would get frustrated if it wasn't. She always had to win, no matter if it was a talent show, cards, she had to be the winner. She would sit on cards. And they let her do it. They gave it to her, even if she didn't win. I think it affects her to this day, because she hates losing. That's how come it was so inappropriate when they said we were setting matches. Serena is not going to lose for no one."In 1983, the family moves to Compton, California. After learning that top female tennis players can earn thousands of dollars per tournament, Richard and Oracene begin teaching themselves the game in order to coach their daughters. When Serena is 3 and Venus is 4, they pick up their first rackets, and their parents set to work. Richard eventually leaves his job to coach the girls full time. Serena is a quick study. In 1991, she plays her first junior tournament at the age of 9 and makes it to the final, where she faces Venus.Serena Williams in 1992. Ken Levine/Getty ImagesIsha: "Venus was older and playing tournaments, and Serena wasn't playing tournaments yet. Venus was enrolled in this particular tournament, and Serena wasn't. Unbeknownst to my dad and mom, Serena sent in the application and signed herself up for the tournament. Who does that? You had to pay to sign up, and the tournament directors had to get the money from my parents. She always wanted to be just like Venus; it was that little sister hero-worship thing. Even then, she wanted to compete."Venus Williams (older sister): "She got tired of watching me play. She wanted to play. Back then, I was bigger and stronger, and in the changeovers during the final, she'd say, 'Venus, let me win a game.' I ignored her. We were supposed to be professional. I ended up winning the tournament, and afterward I said, 'Serena, I think we should switch trophies. I like the silver one better anyway.' She was the little sister, so she had no problem taking my trophy. We still have them in our home in Florida."1991Unlike most young players, Serena and Venus play few junior tournaments. Richard chooses instead to hold his daughters out of competition until they are ready to compete on the pro tour. In 1991, they meet with their first high-profile professional coach, Rick Macci, in Compton. A few months later, the family moves to Florida so that Serena and Venus can train with him at Grenelefe Golf & Tennis Resort in Haines City.Rick Macci (Serena's coach from 1991 to 1995): "Normally if I see kids play, I see them at a national tournament. I'm not going to somebody's house. Richard said, 'The only thing I can guarantee you is you won't get shot.' I had to meet this guy. He's a comedian. I flew to Los Angeles on a Friday night. Richard, Oracene, Venus and Serena came to my hotel room in Compton, and we talked for three hours. I will never forget Venus and Serena: One was sitting on each of Richard's legs looking at me while he grilled me: What do you have for breakfast? Why aren't you married? How many girlfriends? Do you travel with kids? What is your religion? What time do you get up? Are you colorblind? Have you ever taught a black person? When that ended, he said, 'We'll pick you up at 7 a.m. and go to East Hills Country Club.'"They picked me up in a Volkswagen van. It was shaking back and forth, three months' worth of McDonald's wrappers, clothes, Coke cans, bottles and a spring coming out of the seat. We get to the courts, and it's not a country club. It's a crummy park. There are guys playing basketball, people passed out in the grass, broken glass all over the courts, people drinking beer. Every person we passed called him King Richard. We had to cross the basketball court to get to the tennis courts, and it parted like the Red Sea.Editor's PicksSerena, Naomi Osaka and the most controversial US Open final in history4yDon Van NattaGOAT debate over: Serena Williams and everyone else6yJohnette Howard20 stars serve up Serena praise8y2 Related"Usually after five minutes I can tell if there is something special. We're hitting balls, and I'm going, 'These girls aren't that good.' There were arms and hair and legs flying everywhere, beads flying out of their hair. They were improvising, hitting off their back feet. Then I said, 'Let's play some points.' I swear to God, their stock went soaring through the hemisphere. Their footwork got better, their prep got better, they cleaned up their act. What blew me away was their burning desire to run and fight and get to every ball like their hair was on fire. I had never seen two kids try so hard. I had never seen bodies that could move like that. Athletes with their body types went to other sports; they didn't play tennis."Lyndrea Price (sister): "Their journey was my journey because I had to wake up too. When Venus and Serena left, I left. It was a family effort. We didn't have a hopper, because those were expensive, so I would shuffle the balls with my racket and pick them up. I wasn't playing, but I was out there every day."Even as a kid, Serena was built. She was so muscular. She didn't have to do a lot of work to get that physique. It was an anomaly that she was gifted at 3 years old to have that body. I remember thinking, wait 'till they get a load of you."Freddy Bryant (East Compton Park employee): "We always had to have the courts cleaned and hosed down because Richard stayed on us. He would bring generators, tennis-serving machines, and the girls would work. Mom would sit in the van and read books. She was always reading. When they finished, the girls would come inside and play pingpong and eat the summer lunch we served to the community. One day stands out to me. Serena was out by herself, going from baseline to baseline and Richard was like, 'You wanna quit? You wanna quit? Go sit in the van with your mom.' Serena said, 'No. No.' She didn't give up, and every time she hit the ball, I heard that grunt. She was 10 years old. She was grunting and fighting. I was like, 'Wow. This little girl right here, she's a tiger.'"Nick Bollettieri  (legendary tennis coach, head of the IMG Academy): "I remember Richard Williams coming to my house in Longboat Key with his two daughters and saying they would be bigger than Michael Jordan. They all thought Richard was crazy. But he did something no one else did. He kept them back from tournaments and taught them technique and to go for it. Their daddy said, 'Run for every ball.' And Serena would say, 'Daddy, the ball is out.' And he'd say, 'No ball is out. You have two sets of eyes: your eyes and your brain. By the time your brain registers what your eyes think they see, it's too late. But when you move, you get the ball.'"Macci : "One day, Venus was out there grinding. Serena wasn't working hard or moving her feet. I said, 'Jameka [Serena's middle name], you have to start moving.' 'What are you going to give me?' she asked. 'I'm tired. I'm thirsty. If you get me a Pepsi and some curly fries and a Snickers bar ... and on the corner, they're selling Green Day T-shirts. If you get me that, I will work 100 percent for the next hour.' This was her maturity. I had an assistant get it all but the shirt, and this girl moved her feet on the court like Spider-Man. For one hour, this girl was on fire. When that hour was up, she said, 'I'm done and I expect that Green Day shirt here at 8 a.m.'"OCT. 28, 1995At age 13, Serena makes her pro debut in the qualifying draw at the Bell Challenge in Quebec, where she loses in less than an hour. She doesn't play a tournament in 1996. At the 1997 Ameritech Cup, she upsets No. 7 Mary Pierce and No. 4 Monica Seles, becoming the lowest-ranked player (No. 304) in the Open era to defeat two top-10 opponents in one tournament. She loses in the semifinal match.Bollettieri : "From the years I traveled with the Williams family and they came to my camps, the story I most remember is Serena sitting in the shade in my stadium court, head down, so upset. She said, 'Nick, I'm tired of coming in second place.'"PART TWO: THE BEGINNING OF THE WINNINGSerena Williams and Max Mirnyi after winning Wimbledon mixed doubles in 1998. AP Photo/Dave CaulkinJULY 1998Serena and partner Max Mirnyi win mixed doubles at Wimbledon and again two months later at the US Open.Macci : "In practice, all Serena did was play guys. She beat guys three to four years older than her. It didn't matter who was on the other side of the net. She didn't look at it like this girl is ranked this or that guy is 16. At 11, she told me she thought she was better than John McEnroe. She said, 'Did you ever see his strokes? He has terrible strokes. I can beat him for sure.' It was silly, but she meant it from the heart. And she believed it. A great competitor is borderline cocky and courageous."JULY 25, 1999Serena, ranked No. 11 in the world, and Venus, No. 4, make their Fed Cup debut. Serena is a last-minute replacement by coach Billie Jean King when Seles pulls out with tendinitis in her right arm. The Williams sisters account for all four wins in the U.S. team's 4-1 victory over Italy, sending them to the final. Mary Jo Fernandez (former professional tennis player, broadcaster, member of 1999 Fed Cup team): "She was young, a teenager, and that was my first glimpse of her inner strength and confidence. She was for sure the leader. And her sense of humor -- she's funny. She makes fun of herself. She carried this purse everywhere she went. If someone's pantyhose ripped, she pulled out a pair of pantyhose. It became a running joke during the tournament that whatever you needed, Serena had it in that bag."SEPT. 11, 1999At only 17, Serena wins her first Grand Slam title at the US Open, becoming the first African-American woman to win a major in the Open era. She jumps to No. 4 in the world rankings. It's a Saturday.Venus: "I was the older sister, and everyone thought I would win the first major, but she did. I felt motivated. Now I know what to do. Serena showed me what to do. That was crucial in my success in winning big events. It was a turning point in my career. At the time, I didn't think to say that to her, but over time, I've told her, 'If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have done anything.' We have a good laugh about that."SEPT. 20, 1999Serena's win in Flushing Meadows lands her on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Hollywood comes calling. In December, she guest-stars on "Hollywood Squares," and then, along with Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras and Venus, Serena records an episode of "The Simpsons" titled "Tennis the Menace."Bonnie Pietila (longtime producer and casting director for "The Simpsons"): "Venus and Serena recorded together, and they came to the Fox lot in a big SUV. Serena brought her dog. She was so good. She has voice control. And she can act. There have only been two people who have come in and I've been blown away at how good they were, because they aren't actors: Serena and Peter Frampton. When a nonactor comes in and can be that good, it's a wonderful surprise."After Serena and Venus finished recording the episode, it came time for them to sign covers of copies of the script. They each sat down in front of a pile of covers, and the two of them raced each other to see who could sign the fastest. Serena won."MARCH 15, 2001Venus, ranked No. 3, withdraws from her semifinal match at Indian Wells against Serena, No. 10, citing pain from tendinitis in her knee. Serena automatically advances to the final against Kim Clijsters. As Venus and her dad walk to their seats before the match, Richard says they are attacked with racial slurs. When Serena beats Clijsters, fans boo. The sisters vow never return to Indian Wells. Later that year, the sisters meet again, in the final of the US Open -- the first Williams vs. Williams Grand Slam title match. Serena loses 6-2, 6-4 to big sister Venus. Venus Williams lifting the US Open trophy after defeating her sister Serena in 2001. Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesPam Shriver (former top-five professional tennis player): "It was the first prime-time US Open final. There had been sensational buildup, and CBS was up against a huge college football game. Venus won and Serena was so angry about losing to her sister. She had a look that was totally different from the look Venus had when she lost. Venus always thought if she had to lose, it might as well be to a family member. But Serena hated it more because it was her sister."2003 After withdrawing from the 2002 Australian Open with an ankle sprain, Serena goes on a tear. She wins her first clay-court title at the Italian Open, the 2002 French Open, her first Wimbledon title and the US Open. She returns to the Australian Open a year later and wins, completing the Serena Slam by holding all four major titles simultaneously but not in the same calendar year. Incredibly, Serena faces Venus in all four finals matches. Shriver : "It is the most unlikely thing that has ever happened in our sport -- that siblings would face off against each other in the final of four straight majors; it is a once-in-a-galaxy type of thing. Nowadays you don't get the same rematch in one major final. That Serena won wasn't surprising. She is an all-around better tennis player than Venus. She has better technique, better grit and a more competitive, grinding spirit. Richard forecasted that a long time before there was ever a Serena Slam. It's hard to believe they grew up with the same coaching. They're so different. It's almost like Venus, being the older sister, was the guinea pig on certain shots, and they got the technique better with Serena."PART THREE: THE HARD YEARSSEPT. 14, 2003Serena's oldest sister and assistant, Yetunde Price, is killed in Compton, caught in gang crossfire while in the car with her boyfriend, a gang member. Serena is the first to learn of her sister's death and informs her mother and 'Tunde's children. Isha: "The thing I hated most about that situation was that Serena was the one who got the call. They had attempted to call us all, but it was late and my phone was off. We relied a lot on each other; it was us holding each other up at a really difficult time. Unless you've experienced that kind of loss, you can't fully describe to somebody else what that feels like, like part of yourself is gone. You have to almost re-learn how to live, how to approach every day."Shriver: "That news hit her very heavily. Her resilience throughout some major personal setbacks, her parents' divorce [in 2002], her sister's killing, her medical situations, she's had her share of heartbreak as far as relationships -- it's so impressive she's been able to stay on tennis track through such significant personal adversity."JULY 3, 2004No. 10 Serena loses to No. 15 Maria Sharapova in the Wimbledon final. Shriver: "Losing to Sharapova made Serena the champion she is today. Losing to her in straight sets was a stinging loss that catapulted Serena, in the big picture, to greater heights. That loss, followed by another to Sharapova at the year-end championships -- the last time Sharapova beat Serena --- was important for Serena. She didn't want to lose in major finals. Her record today in major finals is amazing, only six losses."Serena Williams falls to the ground during the 2004 Wimbledon final, in which she lost to Maria Sharapova. AP Photo/Anja Niedringhaus2005After winning her second Australian Open on Jan. 29, Serena spends much of 2005 and 2006 struggling with knee injuries, poor conditioning and depression stemming from her sister's death. She begins searching for life outside of tennis, guest-starring on TV shows and attending movie premieres. In the May 2006 issue of Tennis magazine, Chris Evert pens an open letter to Serena, imploring her to recommit to tennis. Two months later, Serena dips to No. 140 in the rankings. Chris Evert (former world No. 1 professional tennis player, tennis broadcaster): "I always thought she could be the greatest of all time. But when I wrote that letter, I didn't think she was taking it as seriously as she could. She was losing to players she should have been beating, she wasn't in good shape, she was going to movie premieres, she was distracted. I didn't want her to look back when she retired and think, 'All those years I squandered and I should have been in the best shape, I could have been more focused.' I didn't want her to have regrets. But what I didn't take into consideration was that she was going through a lot in her personal life too."Serena Williams in 2005. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images2007 Serena begins to rekindle her love of tennis and takes her first of several trips to Africa for charity appearances. She decides that if she is going to play, she is going to win. At the 2007 Australian Open, unseeded and ranked No. 81, she astounds the tennis world by beating Sharapova 6-1, 6-2 in the final. Oracene: "Going to Africa changed her life. She came back a totally different person. She fell in love with Africa. That helped her to refocus on her life and her career. Seeing where she came from, how we got to where we are now, seeing the ports where they shipped us off and the life of our people, that really changed her attitude about being a black woman."Newly determined, Serena begins working with renowned fitness trainer Mackie Shilstone. Serena and Venus win doubles at the 2008 Beijing Olympics under U.S. team coach Zina Garrison. A few weeks later, Serena wins her third US Open title. Mackie Shilstone (fitness trainer): "I worked with Peyton Manning before his final season. I've worked with thousands of professional athletes, some of the best in the world. I evaluate them all on their mental toughness, and Serena is one of the most mentally tough individual athletes I have ever seen, man or woman, in 30 years of experience."At the 2007 Australian Open, unseeded and ranked No. 81, Serena Williams astounds the tennis world by beating Maria Sharapova 6-1, 6-2 in the final. AP Photo/Rick StevensAPRIL 2009Serena launches a second clothing line (her first, Aneres, launched in 2003), this time with the Home Shopping Network, and appears on HSN for the first time. Mindy Grossman (CEO and director, Home Shopping Network; former global VP of apparel at Nike): "When she's on HSN, we take calls from viewers. The number and diversity of people who call in to talk to her is incredible. Normally if someone calls in, they have the product, are buying the product or want to talk about fashion. With Serena, they feel they have a connection with her; they're calling in to talk with someone they know. Everyone who appears on HSN gets a report card every visit. Each time, she wants to do better than the last time, and she wants to know who else is doing well."Isha: "She is completely invested in her fashion line. It's not just 'show up and smile for the cameras at HSN.' She has to understand what goes into making the clothes, why they chose that fashion. Her days, they're nightmarish in terms of what she has to do in order to execute her life."AUGUST 2009Coming off a win at Wimbledon and having won three of her past four majors, Serena makes it to the semifinal of the US Open, where she looks to defend her 2008 title. In the semifinal, Serena plays Clijsters, at the time an unseeded wild card who had last won the tournament in 2005, and loses the first set 6-4. She bashes her racket on the court, earning her a warning for racket abuse. In the second set, with Clijsters up 6-5 and Serena serving to send the set into a tiebreak, lineswoman Shino Tsurubuchi calls Serena for a foot fault on her second serve. Serena argues the call, threatens the lineswoman by saying, "I swear to God I'm [expletive] going to take this [expletive] ball and shove it down your [expletive] throat," and is assessed a point penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct, ending the match. Three months later, she is fined $82,500 and placed on a two-year probation. It's the largest fine ever levied against a professional tennis player.Shriver: "Most every player would say how unlikely it would be for you to be playing a two-and-a-half-hour match and for the only foot fault to be called that late in the match. That would have been Serena's initial anger. Why, at this crucial moment, is this my first foot fault of the night?"It was a hurtful moment for her on many levels. I don't think her intent was to lose it and say what she said. I just think in the heat of the moment, it's what happened. The publicity from that match and how she reacted was so difficult, so negative, that it didn't help her public popularity."In the last year and a half, especially, when Serena has had challenging moments, she has been much more gracious, given the opponent more credit. That doesn't mean she won't get mad and smack her racket and get upset. She still has her moments, but that's normal. But that was her worst moment."Isha: "I felt like she was being denied an opportunity to make a mistake. We've all said and done things we're not proud of because we're not perfect. But she didn't have the ability to be human. And nobody wants to feel like that, like I can't say anything, I can't do anything. If I'm not swinging a racket, people don't see me as a person. All they see is this sportsperson, and in this moment, as a woman and as a black woman, I'm not supposed to be able to express hurt when I know I'm being cheated. That's taking my voice, taking my humanity. So in that moment, I was most protective of her."Everybody was like, 'You've got to apologize to the world because of what you said.' That wasn't coming from [her family]. What we said was, 'Obviously it was a mistake; you absolutely owe the umpire an apology, but that's it. And that should be something private between you and her. Outside of that, whatever you feel you need to do to feel whole and be at peace about what happened, that's what you do. Because that's the only way you can stay true to yourself.'"What she learned is you have to keep yourself in check and handle your situations with dignity and grace. Sometimes you have to be the bigger person, even on the court, calm down and know that it's just a game and understand the space it should hold in your life. These are all parts of a bigger lesson."Shilstone: "Some of her outbursts on the court, they have been misconstrued. I was there when the woman called the foot fault. That woman missed completely. People don't think athletes are supposed to be human or have heart. There is no malice with Serena. It's the heat of the battle. Afterwards she apologized, but that is forgotten."Oracene: "It wasn't just that call. All the years and emotions popped out at once. Balls that were clearly in, that everyone in the stands could see were clearly in. That was her breaking point."Serena Williams arguing with the officials after her foot fault in the 2009 US Open. Julian Finney/Getty ImagesPART FOUR: THE BREAKJANUARY 2010 Serena beats rival Justine Henin in the Australian Open and wins doubles with Venus. But a nagging knee injury forces her to miss the next four months of tennis. To fill her time, Serena researches schools and enrolls in a 240-hour course at Palm Beach Nail Academy to become a certified nail technician. She says she plans to complete the course in one year while being the school's top student -- and its most fashionable. She practices her new craft by giving Oprah Winfrey a pedicure on air. Isha: "She's always been obsessed with her nails. And then it became, 'I could do this myself. I'm going to nail school.' She was completely fascinated. I didn't believe her. Then she got injured and couldn't play, and she enrolled herself in nail school. Then these opportunities started coming in. One day, she was like, 'If I do Oprah's nails, will it count for my hours?' Absolutely. Once she mastered it, it was almost like, 'OK, that's done. Finished and check and on to the next thing. What am I curious about now? How do I want to grow now?'"JULY 7, 2010 Four days after winning Wimbledon, Serena is walking out of a restaurant in Munich when she steps on broken glass, lacerating a tendon on the top of her right foot. This begins a bad run of health for Serena: In October, she reinjures the same tendon, forcing her to have season-ending surgery. Then, in January, a pulmonary embolism is detected in her lungs. Serena undergoes emergency treatment in March 2011 to remove a hematoma related to the embolism and is hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Serena says the scary experience is as mentally difficult as the death of her sister. She does not play again until June. Isha: "Seeing her in the hospital, in the bed, her eyes were closed, she was connected to tubes, and we didn't know the severity of the diagnosis, and I was terrified. This was our baby sister. When we found out everything, it became extremely real. We'd already suffered loss, and it was unfathomable to me that we would get hit like that twice, with the first [sister] and the last. It seemed like it wasn't even possible. We all prayed."Shilstone: "A couple of months later, we were training in West Palm Beach and she was fit, but she was grabbing her chair. She was wheezing. I realized she was still suffering from the pulmonary embolism. It was the battle of our lives. Before her next match, I told her, 'You've been introduced to death. You can't be worried about the woman on the other side of the net.'"JUNE 2011 Away from tennis for nearly a year, Serena returns to the court but struggles to find her game. She loses in the fourth round at Wimbledon and drops to No. 175, her lowest ranking since 1997. Then she loses in the final of the US Open in September. Around this time, the ever-curious Serena begins taking online classes at UMass University Without Walls. Her major is business management, which she later switches to pre-med. On the court, her losing streak continues into 2012: She gets knocked out in the fourth round of the Australian Open in January and in the first round of the French Open in May. It is her first loss in the opening round of a Grand Slam -- and the last straw. Having recently been introduced to French tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou by her friend and fellow pro Grigor Dimitrov, Serena reaches out to Mouratoglou. Patrick Mouratoglou (Serena's coach since 2012): "A few days after her [French Open] loss, she called and asked if she could come to the academy to practice. Most players leave town after they lose. She said, 'I want to practice because I want to win Wimbledon.' She wanted to get back to winning a Grand Slam and being No. 1. She hadn't won a Grand Slam for two years and was very disappointed. I said yes, and she asked for two hitting partners. She came and hit for 45 minutes. I was there but was not supposed to say anything to her. At the changeover, she sat down, turned to me and said, 'Speak to me.' So I spoke to her. Then she said, 'Can we start now?' And I said, 'Of course.'"2012With Mouratoglou, Serena works on her serve placement and tactics, as well as her confidence and conditioning. In April, in another unconventional move for a top player two decades into her career, Serena switches from natural gut to hybrid racket strings. Three months later, she wins Wimbledon for the fifth time. She follows that performance by winning two Olympic gold medals, in singles and doubles, at the London Games. Serena Williams at Wimbledon in 2012. Antoine Couvercelle/Panoramic/Icon SportswireMouratoglou: "She fought incredibly at Wimbledon. She is always a fighter but maybe more in that tournament than ever. She was coming to the matches with a plan. Of course, winning Wimbledon made a big difference in terms of her confidence. It's the same for every player ... the more you win, the more you win."Fernandez: "At the Olympics, she went through the draw without dropping games. I've never seen anything like it. We're used to how great she serves, but it wasn't only her serve. It was her returns, her groundstrokes, her volleys. She beat players like [Victoria] Azarenka and Sharapova without losing games. It was remarkable. It's the best I've seen her play."SEPTEMBER 2013 Serena, 31 and the oldest female tennis player to be ranked No. 1, wins her fifth US Open. The next day, Serena attends the men's final at Arthur Ashe Stadium with Nike CEO Mark Parker. Serena, a longtime Nike spokeswoman, jokes that she will one day succeed Parker as president of the company. Mark Parker (president and CEO of Nike): "I joined Serena to watch the men's US Open final between [Rafael] Nadal and [Novak] Djokovic. I asked her what she thought of the match, and she told me she had been taking mental notes on how to improve her own game -- the day after winning the Open. During the [2015 Australian] Open, I texted her and asked what she was doing between matches. I found out she was taking pre-med courses."Isha: "She loves holistic medicine. It's a real part of her study and what she wants to do. She's actually really good at it. We have this family event we do, and Serena wrapped me. She knows the muscles and the bones. It's almost irritating. It's like, how much can you learn? She wanted to speak French, so she's fluent in French. Whatever she sets her mind to do, she goes after it with so much enthusiasm and commitment until she gets it done. There are so few people in the universe who do that."PART FIVE: THE ROAD TO 23JAN. 31, 2015Serena meets Sharapova in the Australian Open final for the second time and wins 6-3, 7-6. It is her 16th straight victory over Sharapova. Serena becomes the oldest winner of the Australian Open at 33 years old. It's a Saturday.Serena Williams is overcome with emotion as she arrives on court at Indian Wells after a 13-year boycott. Julian Finney/Getty ImagesMouratoglou: "At the start of the year, she wanted to win. She was hungry. Journalists ask me always, what are my goals for the start of the year? The goal is to win the four Grand Slams. When I work with someone like Serena, what else can you have?"MARCH 13, 2015 Serena returns to Indian Wells after a 13-year boycott of the tournament. A knee injury forces her to withdraw in the semifinals.Isha: "She talked to my mom and dad and then came to me and said, 'I'm thinking about going back to Indian Wells.' I said, 'Really? Are you ready for that?' It took her to come to a place where she was understanding of who she was and how far she had come, so that Indian Wells didn't matter. You have to get to a place in yourself where, win, lose or draw, I'm doing this for me. I'm not doing it for anybody else. I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do for me at this point in my life. And to watch that process and see the reception she got, it was overwhelming."All the years when people were asking, 'Are you coming back?' Saying, 'Come back, please come back.' Now it was not anybody asking her -- but her making the decision. I was extremely proud because I don't know if I could have done it. She taught us all in that moment."Garrison (former professional tennis player, second African-American woman to make a Grand Slam final, at Wimbledon, 1990): "I think she's learned a lot about forgiveness over the years. What she did last year at [Indian Wells] blew my mind, made me cry. The fact that she's been big enough to humble herself in that way and show forgiveness was a strong statement for the times we live in right now, when young people need to see a leader like that. She said it felt right to her. Forgiveness was a big part of it, and not wanting to dwell on it anymore. That kind of energy brings you down, when you're holding on to old anger. The fact that she got to forgiveness, that can only be done by looking into yourself, deciding to be the best person you can be and making changes within yourself."MAY 2015After reading Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's bestseller "Lean In," Serena strikes up a friendship with Sandberg and her husband, Dave, in early 2015. When Dave dies of a heart attack in May, Serena reaches out to comfort her friend.Lyndrea: "Serena is the type of person who will call you to make sure you're OK. She'll call every 10 minutes if she thinks something is wrong. She'll sense this. Sheryl Sandberg lost her husband, and she did this for Sheryl for, like, months on end, every day. In order to help someone else, you have to have been through it. You go through things so you can uplift someone else. And that's what Serena did. I'm most proud of her in those moments. It's not about money, press, fame. It's about human connection."JUNE 4, 2015Serena reaches the semifinal of the French Open. Sick with the flu and down 4-6, 2-3 to No. 23 Timea Bacsinszky, Serena digs deep, wins the next game and doesn't drop another game in the match. She goes on to win the tournament, beating Lucie Safarova in three sets in the final, her 20th Grand Slam victory.Serena Williams was sick with the flu during the 2015 French Open. DOMINIQUE FAGET/AFP/Getty ImagesMouratoglou: "I don't think I've seen a player play being so sick. She would stay the whole day on the sofa and try to go out for a walk for 10 minutes and come back after two minutes. Not being able to sleep and having so much fever throughout most of the tournament, from the second round to the semis, then to play at the highest level, in the sun, and win against the best players in the world was impressive."JULY 11, 2015 Serena beats Garbine Muguruza 6-4, 6-4 to win Wimbledon for the sixth time and, at 33 years, 289 days, becomes the oldest player to win a Grand Slam singles title. With the win, she earns her second Serena Slam by holding all four major titles at once. She is one win from tying Graf's record of 22 Grand Slam wins and becoming the first woman since Graf in 1988 to complete the calendar-year Grand Slam. Mouratoglou: "Before winning Wimbledon, she had won two Grand Slams, but it's only two. For her, it's not incredible. But when she won the third, you start to think, 'Now we are getting close to something big.'"Serena Williams after winning the 2015 Australian Open. Rex Features/AP PhotoSerena Williams holds her French Open trophy and gathers with the tournament's ball boys and ball girls. Jon Buckle/Empics SportSerena Williams serves during the 2015 Wimbledon final, which she goes on to win. Julian Finney/Getty ImagesAUG. 15, 2015 At the Rogers Cup in Toronto, the warm-up to the US Open, Serena loses to Swiss teen Belinda Bencic in the semifinals.Mouratoglou: "She comes to me the morning after and says, 'We have to go practice; I'm tired of losing.' We were in August. She'd lost three matches ... in a year."Shilstone: "We do a thing called the Mackie Short Shuttle. It's a series of sprints with recovery time between them, and the sprints and the rest get progressively shorter as the workout goes on, but they go up in number. When we first started, Serena was falling out at different times. Last year before the US Open, she did all 72 sprints for the first time. After the tournament, she said, 'Those doggone sprints, they saved me. I can go forever.'"SEPT. 8, 2015Serena advances to the US Open quarterfinals, where she beats sister Venus. Then, in one of the most shocking upsets in tennis history, Serena loses to unseeded Roberta Vinci in the semifinals. Mouratoglou: "On this morning, I saw that she was in a bad day. She had a lot of pain in her knees and the stress went higher. There was clearly big pressure from the outside. The US Open advertising was about her only. Vinci played the match of her life, and Serena made more mistakes than usual and would not go 100 percent on her shots. She couldn't hit as many winners as usual. The good thing, and it's what I've told her, whether you do this or not, it is not going to change who you are in your career. You've won 21 Grand Slams. You are going to win others. You are going to beat the record of all time."Roberta Vinci (professional tennis player currently ranked No. 8): "Before the match, I spoke with my coach. He said, 'Don't think that this is your first semifinal in singles. Enjoy the moment.' There are no tactics against Serena. At the beginning, I was nervous. But I think Serena was more nervous than me. She had a lot of pressure. Until the end, I said in my mind, it's impossible that I can win, but try to stay focused every single point. Don't think about Serena."Roberta Vinci celebrates a point against Serena Williams during a 2015 US Open semifinal. Vinci would later win the match. Mike Stobe/Getty Images for the USTAGarrison: "In the tennis community, that loss to Vinci doesn't take anything away from Serena. I was at the match. I knew the pressure would hit her, I just didn't know how and when. When Steffi did it, she didn't have social media. Serena couldn't get away from it if she wanted to."Mouratoglou: "For quite a while, she was really down because she felt like she failed. 'I let them down.' She didn't want to see people. Even though she's had more success than anyone, when she fails, it is more painful than for anyone else. Other players lose every week, or out of 30 weeks, they lose 27 or 28 times. She does not. She had to go through this process. She knew she had time, so she wanted to stay away from tennis, so she did."SEPT. 15, 2015At New York Fashion Week, Serena presents her fall 2015 collection with Home Shopping Network in front of Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, models Gigi Hadid and Lily Aldridge, and Drake. She announces in October that she'll withdraw from the final tournaments of the season, the WTA Finals and the China Open.Serena Williams takes a bow after her fashion line's show during New York Fashion Week in 2015. Fernando Leon/Getty ImagesGrossman: "She had just come off a disappointment at the US Open, and she put herself into this show. She cast all the models. She styled and accessorized every outfit, worked with the hair and makeup artists. She chose every piece of music. During the show, she was behind the scenes making sure the models were going out at the right cadence; everybody is put together in the right way. At the end, she came out and took a bow and looked fabulous in one of her creations."DECEMBER 2015 Sports Illustrated names Serena its Sportsperson of the Year, the first solo female to be awarded the honor since middle-distance runner Mary Decker in 1983. Serena is criticized for the magazine's cover image, in which she is wearing a black lacy bodysuit and stilettos and is seated on a golden throne. Garrison: "Richard and Oracene did a very good job of making all of their girls comfortable within their own skin. Venus and Serena told me that their mom told them every day that they were beautiful, strong women. To hear that every day, and then believe it, is amazing. I've struggled with my weight for years. She tells me, 'Keep going, don't stop.' She's just as encouraging to people around her as she is to the world. I don't think she tries to be a role model to girls, I think she's just true to herself, and that's enough. She doesn't have to prove anything to the doubters anymore."Oracene: "Other athletes would read things in the press and then couldn't do their jobs. So I made them stay away from press. Nothing negative inside their heads. Once you put fear in your head and get scared and doubt yourself, you can collapse. To be successful, you have to have confidence in who you are and what you stand for and the hell with whatever they say. The girls used to say, 'Mom, why do you say you don't care?' Because I don't care what people think. I know who I am."JANUARY 2016 At the Australian Open, Serena looks dominant in the first six matches but loses in three sets to No. 6 Angelique Kerber in the final. She follows with a loss to No. 4 Muguruza in the final of the French Open, marking the first back-to-back Grand Slam final losses in her career.Angelique Kerber (professional tennis player currently ranked No. 2): "It's an honor being on the court with her, and winning against her in Australia was special. She came to me after and was so happy for me that I won my first Grand Slam. This is what is special about her; she was so nice after a really tough match that she lost."Mouratoglou: "All that period, she played good tennis. But one of the things that makes Serena Serena is her mental toughness, her ability to play unbelievable when it's necessary, and this disappeared. She lost it. During that period, she was playing very good tennis. But this killer instinct, she didn't have it. She was not Serena."JULY 9, 2016Serena finds Serena, winning Wimbledon for the seventh time and taking her 22nd Grand Slam title, tying Graf's Open-era record.Serena and Venus Williams celebrate their women's doubles victory at Wimbledon in 2016. Serena also won singles. Ben Queenborough/BPIMouratoglou: "Two days after the French, she called me. I hung up and turned to my business partner and said, 'Serena's back.' She talked to me in a way that was Serena. The champion's mentality, all the things that make her so special, came back. I don't know why it came back at that time. Maybe the loss at the French was one too many. You never know why it clicks. But it clicked."AUGUST 2016 A shoulder injury forces Serena to pull out of the Rogers Cup. But nothing, she says, will keep her from playing in the Rio Olympics. Clearly struggling with pain, she loses in the third round of singles and first round of doubles play and returns home to Palm Beach, Florida, to rehab and prepare for the US Open.Fernandez: "She was a great leader at the Olympics. She walked in the opening ceremony and went to the village a couple of times. She and Venus are big on pin trading, and Serena showed the rookies how to get the most pins. Even though she wasn't 100 percent, she tried her best to get fit and healthy. She didn't want to miss it. I will remember how excited she was to be back at the Olympics."Mouratoglou: "She was injured. She couldn't serve. She had pain playing. If it was any other tournament, she wouldn't have played. Afterward she took a day off, and we got back to work."Serena Williams competes at the 2016 Rio Olympics, where she loses in the third round of singles. ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP/Getty ImagesAUG. 12, 2016Home in Florida, Serena Snapchats a video of herself performing her version of the routine that won U.S. gymnast Simone Biles all-around gold the day before in Rio. Mouratoglou: "She had watched gymnastics on TV. She started to do it and then laughed at herself and said, 'Film me.' If I can say something of her character, she is more open to people now. The documentary was the first step. Snapchat is continuing the same. She hasn't changed, but people are getting to know her."AUG. 22, 2016 Serena arrives in New York to begin training for the US Open. Shilstone: "I only have a week to get her ready, so we do crazy things. I hooked her up to cables that launch her like an F-18 to work on acceleration and deceleration while changing direction. We do standing bike sprints. There's a drill I call the fun 'n' gun that's based on my work with Army Rangers. If you look at the motion of the server, it's the same as the release of a shot put, so I have her shot-put a medicine ball."SEPT. 8, 2016Still recovering from her shoulder injury and dealing with a left knee injury suffered in the second round, Serena commits 31 unforced errors and six double faults in a stunning loss to No. 11 Karolina Pliskova in the US Open semifinals. When the world rankings are released four days later, she loses her No. 1 ranking to eventual US Open winner Angelique Kerber, ending her record-tying -- with Steffi Graf -- 186-week streak at No. 1. Two weeks later, she turns 35.Isha: "My first conversation with Serena after that match was, 'What are you watching on TV?' I went to her room at the hotel, and we all chilled together and it wasn't about tennis. It was about being sisters and hanging out, and that's what we did, all of us. She still took her time, and you knew that's what she was thinking about. But it's not what we talked about."When did she start thinking about next season and the Australian Open? The moment she stepped off the court, she was already there."Serena Williams during her semifinal against Karolina Pliskova at the 2016 US Open. Elsa/Getty ImagesNOV. 11, 2016Accompanied by her sisters, mother, niece and nephews, Serena returns to Compton for the first time in years to open the Yetunde Price Resource Center in honor of her late sister. The next day, she and her family return to the East Compton tennis courts where she and Venus learned the game to dedicate newly refurbished courts to the community.Aja Brown (Mayor of Compton): "The impact her presence has on this city is phenomenal. Her coming back is truly a beacon of light. She and Venus were awesome ambassadors and helped to lift the city in a time when it was really tough to be here. The city was plagued with violence and had so many negative connotations with the name Compton. But when we were able to turn on the TV and see Serena winning, dominating the game of tennis, we all felt uplifted. I was a little girl watching her do things I never thought were possible, so to be able to introduce her today was a great honor."Isha: "Serena's doing this 30-day challenge, where she wants to do cardio every day for 30 days. This is a person who doesn't enjoy working out. When we got back to the hotel, it was late. Serena was like, 'I've got to work out. I'm committed to these 30 days.' She went to the gym and did her cardio and then was so energized. Her dedication is inspiring. She's helped all of us."DEC. 30, 2016In a 14-line poem posted to her page on Reddit, Serena announces her engagement to the website's co-founder Alexis Ohanian, whom she's been dating for a year-and-a-half. On his Facebook page, Ohanian posts the words "She said yes," as well as links to Serena's Reddit post.Shilstone: "Serena called me and said, 'Guess what, Mackie? I'm engaged!' She knows I don't follow Twitter and all that. And I said, 'Wow, you're getting married! But what are we first? We're warriors.' I was saying to her, 'Keep your head in the game.' I've been around for eight years, so I've seen a lot of people come and go, and this young man is the real deal. He is a genuine, nice man and she is very happy. I told her, 'Serena, now you'll have to set me up on Reddit like you did on Twitter.'"JANUARY 2017In swirling windy weather, Serena loses 6-4, 6-7 (3), 6-4 to American Madison Brengle in the second round of the ASB Classic in New Zealand, her first tournament since the US Open. After the match, she calls the conditions "my least-favorite I've ever played in" and turns her focus to the Australian Open.Shilstone: "We've been conferring a lot since the US Open. She took a tremendous amount of time off to contend with injuries. Right now, she has some ring rust, and it's going to take a little time to shake it off. Tennis is all about timing, and right now, she's working on her timing. She needs to get it back, and you do that by playing games. She's a seasoned veteran, so it won't take her long."On the first day I met her in New Orleans eight years ago, I asked her, 'Are you at your best?' She said, 'I don't think I've ever been at my best.' If I asked her that question today, I am willing to say she'd tell me the same thing -- because the minute she says, 'Yeah, I'm the best I can be,' it's over."Isha: "I want to see her win 23 for her. She is her own worst critic, her toughest competition, and she's really hard on herself when she doesn't succeed. I'd like to see her win it as soon as possible, but for her. Not for me, not for anybody else. I want that so badly for her."Mouratoglou: "It was good thing she lost early. It helped her to regroup and get ready for the Australian Open. Of course, winning would be good, too, but losing was a wake-up call. Not that she was not doing the right things. She prepared well, but she realized that if she is not 100 percent focused in a match, she can lose. Going into Australia, she knew she had to be 100 percent focused in the first two rounds."JAN. 28, 2017At 5:03 a.m. ET, Serena defeats big sister Venus 6-4, 6-4 in Melbourne to win her seventh Australian Open title and capture her 23rd Grand Slam, giving her more Grand Slam titles than any player in the Open era. There is no arguing it any longer: Serena is the greatest.After the match, Venus addresses the crowd first. She motions toward Serena and says, "That's my little sister, guys. Congratulations, Serena, on No. 23. I have been right there with you. Your win has always been my win. I think you know that I'm enormously proud of you." Serena responds in her speech by saying, "I really would like to take this moment to congratulate Venus. She's an amazing person. There's no way I would be at 23 without her. There's no way I'd be at one without her. There's no way I'd have anything without her. She's my inspiration -- she's the only reason I'm standing here today and the only reason the Williams sisters exist." Serena Williams reacts after winning her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open. SAEED KHAN/AFP/Getty ImagesGarrison: "I watched. Of course I watched. The match was very emotional. Their speeches were heartfelt and humbling, and I heard them speak like I hadn't in a long time. I've known Serena and Venus since they were 7 and 8, and to watch them grow as women on and off the court, overcome all they have, to play in their 30s the way they are playing, it's amazing. They are making their own rules."Being Serena's mentor when she came on tour, she has defied all odds against what people thought she could do. I will never forget Billie Jean King saying to me one day when Serena was young, 'She can be the greatest of all time if she hones it all in.' To watch her wisdom and physical and mental abilities come together to win 23 is exciting. She understands her place in history."Mouratoglou: "It was very emotional. It's the first time since the start of my career with Serena that I had more stress than usual, the whole day. I felt the weight of the history. I tried to hide it as much as I could to her, but there was much more pressure."I don't think playing Venus was a big deal for her. I think the importance of winning the 23rd Slam was much more important than who she plays. She obviously prefers to play someone else but was focused on finding a way to win. She doesn't like to play Venus, but she was happy that Venus was in a final again and back to a great level. There was positive and negative."What's next is to establish her own record. Will it be 23, 25, 30? Nobody knows. But I think it's the most exciting journey for someone like Serena, to make her record."Of course she is still enjoying the game. Otherwise she would have stopped. She loves to play, but she also loves the idea of winning Grand Slams and exploring foreign territory. The fact that we don't know where we're going next, and how far we're going to go, makes it more exciting than beating any record. She is leaving a trace in history and I want this trace to be as big as possible."Additional reporting by Lindsay Berra.

			Serena Williams Says She Never Felt Broke Growing Up In Compton		

			The tennis star sat down to talk money and finances as one of the world's top athletes.

By Danielle Kwateng-Clark ·
Updated October 26, 2020 







Serena Williams is essentially the American dream. The 35-year-old was raised in the rough neighborhood of Compton, CA, was trained in tennis as a child, and developed into a gracious champion. But what’s interesting is that her circumstances as a child, didn’t reflect on how she saw herself and performed.
“Since I was a teenager, I’ve had to make every financial decision in my life,” the beauty told Maverick Carter on Uniterrupted’s Kneading Dough. “I’ve had to learn how to make good ones and how to make bad ones, to make better ones.”
Adding, “I never ever, ever felt broke. Looking back, I’m like, ‘Wow.’ We lived in a two-bedroom house with seven people. I don’t know how my parents were able to make me feel that way, but they did, and it was special. So I never felt when I came into money that I needed to go buy this because I never wanted anything. So it was a great way.”
Someone she revealed she looked up to for her work in compensating women tennis players comparable to men was Billie Jean King. And like King, Williams hopes to leave a legacy of equality. 
“Honestly, if I’m able to open the door for the next person, that means a lot to me too. And hopefully, they’ll be able to do better than me.”

Serena Williams (AP Photo/Charles Krupa)




The U.S. Open began earlier this week, and Serena Williams has started strong beating Maria Sharapova 6-1, 6-1 in the first round and Cat McNally 5-7, 6-3, 6-1 in the second round.
Williams is one of the greatest tennis players of our time, but to win 23 grand slams she has had to overcome obstacles most tennis players have not: she is a black woman in a predominantly white sport, she grew up in a poor neighborhood practicing on public courts that were not always safe, endured intense scrutiny of her body, racism and misogyny. In spite of these things, she is an outstanding tennis player. Since the earliest stages of her career, Williams has embodied the grit, resilience and mental toughness required to overcome every hurdle and hardship she has had to face, inspiring athletes around the world.

Stand Up For Yourself
At the U.S. Open final last year against Naomi Osaka, Williams challenged umpire Carlos Ramos who called a violation on Williams for receiving coaching from her box when her coach Patrick Mouratoglou gave her a thumbs up. “If he gives me a thumbs-up, he is telling me to come on,” Williams told Ramos at the time. She accused him of questioning her integrity and of punishing her more harshly than her male counter-parts.
Williams received a second violation, costing her a point, when she broke her racket out of frustration after the fifth game in the second set. Many players, especially men, break their rackets out of frustration and are rarely given a warning or violation, so Williams demanded Ramos apologize to her for his bias, and said “You stole a point from me. You’re a thief too.” Ramos gave her a third violation for what he deemed verbal abuse, and it cost Williams a game. Osaka ultimately won the match, but Williams very publicly stood up for herself, not letting the bias go unacknowledged.

Don’t Lose Focus
Williams was born in Saginaw, Mich., but her family moved to Compton, Calif. when she was three years old. Compton was a notoriously dangerous neighborhood in the 1980s and 90s as it struggled with unemployment, drugs and gun violence. The Williams’ sister’s father famously took them to practice on the community tennis courts. Williams said, "If you can keep playing tennis when somebody is shooting a gun down the street, that's concentration."

When You Fail, Get Back Up 
After qualifying for the Australian Open in 1998, Williams was matched with Irina Spîrlea, the six seed. It wasn’t an ideal first match for Williams who had just qualified for the open, and she lost the first set. But she refused to go down without a fight. “When I go down a set, I have to forget it. ‘OK, it’s not over, you’re still in it, you have to fight for it. Stay present,” she told GQ Sports. It was the first “Serena comeback,” and she went on to win the match 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-1.
Believing In Yourself Can Be A Lonely Business 
People doubted whether Williams would ever be able to return to her former level of play after she had given birth. Williams has said exhaustively that part of overcoming obstacles and ultimately achieving success is ignoring the odds and what people think— believe in yourself. “You have to believe in yourself when no one else does,” she says.

Never Ever Give Up 
Tennis is a punishing sport, it is as mentally demanding as it is physically demanding: losing a point, a game, or a set you should not have, a poor hit, a double fault, etc. can alter your mindset and impact your quality of play. She has said tennis is 70% mental. Part of that is not unraveling in the moment, not emotionally giving up. Williams credits this mindset to her victories. “I just never give up. I fight to the end. You can’t go out and say, ‘I want a bag of never-say-die spirit.’ It’s not for sale. It has to be innate,” she said.  
Don’t Care What Others Think
Williams has endured a lot of sexism and racism, especially for her physical strength, though it has been a huge factor in her dominance. She has long preached to not care what others think, and said, “Think of all the girls who could become top athletes but quit sports because they’re afraid of having too many defined muscles and being made fun of or called unattractive.”Frances BridgesEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

10 Books About Serena Williams That You Should Read
 by Sharee Hereford | Sep 9, 2022 | Black Authors, Black Literature, Latest Updates, listicle, Sistah Girl Listicles, Sistah Girls Book Club | 0 comments


Sistah Girls, Serena Williams is the greatest athlete of all time–full stop. We watched as the young girl from Compton rise to fame because of her outstanding athleticism in the game of tennis.
Williams has won more Grand Slam singles titles (23) than any other woman or man during the open era. And if that wasn’t enough, when teamed up with her sister Venus Williams they have taken home 14 Grand Slam doubles, the second most for a pair in the open era.
After announcing her retirement from the sport, Williams played her final match at the US Open (which was also the most watched match in its 43-year history) against Australia’s Ajla Tomljanović. Fans cheered from the stands and from their homes as Williams took her final bow in the third round.
Williams is more than an amazing athlete she’s also a great businesswoman and yes, an author too. We’ve rounded up some books authored by our champ as well as other books about her that you should definitely read.
 
On the Line by Serena Williams

From growing up in the tough, hardscrabble neighborhood of Compton, California, to being trained by her father on public tennis courts littered with broken glass and drug paraphernalia, to becoming the top women’s player in the world, Serena has proven to be an inspiration to her legions of fans both young and old.
Her accomplishments have not been without struggle: being derailed by injury, devastated by the tragic shooting of her older sister, and criticized for her unorthodox approach to tennis.
Yet somehow, Serena always manages to prevail. Both on the court and off, she’s applied the strength and determination that helped her to become a champion to successful pursuits in philanthropy, fashion, television, and film.
My Life: Queen of the Court 2nd Edition by Serena Williams

My Life Explosive and revealing autobiography from one of the most successful and popular women tennis players of the modern era.
Venus and Serena: Serving from the Hip: 10 Rules for Living, Loving, and Winning by Serena Williams, Beard Hilary, and Venus Williams

These superstars and super sisters share their secrets in this straight-talking smart guide. Speaking candidly about their personal experiences, the sisters give you the inside scoop on:
• What it takes to rise and stay on top.
• Who watches their backs when the pressure is on.
• How they spend—and save—their money.
• Dating—their real deal on romance.
• Book smarts—keeping grades up and study stress down.
• Loving the skin you’re in.
Black and White: The Way I See It by Richard Williams

Born into poverty in Shreveport, Louisiana in the 1940s, Richard Williams was blessed by a strong, caring mother who remained his lifelong hero, just as he became a hero to Venus and Serena. From the beginning of his life, Richard’s mother taught him to live by the principles of courage, confidence, commitment, faith, and love.
He passed the same qualities on to his daughters, who grew up loving their father and valuing the lessons he taught them. “I still feel really close to my father,” says Serena. “We have a great relationship. There is an appreciation. There is a closeness because of what we’ve been through together, and a respect.”
A self-made man, Williams has walked a long, hard, exciting, and ultimately rewarding road during his life, surmounting many challenges to raise a loving family and two of the greatest tennis players who ever lived. Black and White is the extraordinary story of that journey and the indomitable spirit that made it all possible.
Serena Williams: Tennis Champion, Sports Legend, and Cultural Heroine by Merlisa Lawrence Corbett

More than a biography, Serena Williams: Tennis Champion, Sports Legend, and Cultural Heroine not only tells the story of her upbringing and remarkable career but also looks at Williams as a sports pioneer.
Merlisa Lawrence Corbett explores Williams’ influence on cultural and political issues such as body shaming, gender equality, and racism in sports and society. Corbett also analyzes Williams’ impact on discussions of feminism, the sports celebrity, and the marketing of female athletes.
Williams is one of the most intriguing and influential figures in sports, and this book is the first to provide a fully-rounded portrait of a tennis icon.
Who Are Venus and Serena Williams (Who Was?) by James Buckley, Who HQ, Andrew Thomson

Venus and Serena Williams are two of the most successful professional American tennis players of all time. Coached at an early age by their parents, the sisters have both gone on to become Grand Slam title winners.
They have both achieved the World Number One ranking in both singles and doubles! Although completely professional and fiercely competitive, the sisters remain close. Who Are Venus and Serena Williams? follows the pair from their early days of training up through the ranks and to the Summer Olympic Games, where they have each won four gold medals—more than any other tennis players.
This title in the New York Times best-selling series has eighty illustrations that help bring the exciting story of tennis champs, Venus and Serena Williams, to life.
I Look Up To… Serena Williams by Anna Membrino, Fatti Burke (Illustrator)

It’s never too early to introduce your child to the people you admire! This board book distills tennis superstar Serena Williams’s excellent qualities into an eminently shareable read-aloud text with graphic, eye-catching illustrations.
Each spread highlights an important trait, and is enhanced by a quote from Serena herself. Kids will grow up hearing the words of this powerful, determined woman and will learn what YOU value in a person!
Sisters: Venus & Serena Williams by Jeanette Winter

Before they were famous tennis stars, Venus and Serena Williams were sisters with big dreams growing up in Compton, California. In the early mornings, they head to the tennis courts, clean up debris, and practice.
They compete in their first tournament and they both win. From there, the girls’ trophy collection grows and grows. Despite adversity and health challenges, the sisters become two of the greatest tennis players of all time. This inspiring story of sisterhood, hard work, and determination is perfect for budding athletes or any young reader with a big dream.
Game Changers: The Story of Venus and Serena Williams by Lesa Cline-Ransome

Six days a week they awoke before the sun came up to practice their serves and returns, to learn to run faster and hit harder. They were unstoppable. At age fourteen, Venus played her first professional match. Three years later, it was Serena’s turn. It wasn’t easy. Some tennis fans cheered for these two fresh faces, while those who were unhappy to see two black girls competing in a nearly all-white sport booed and taunted them. But they didn’t let it stop them.
With vibrant mixed media art, nonfiction superstars Lesa Cline-Ransome and Coretta Scott King Honor winner James E. Ransome share the inspirational story of two tennis legends who were fierce competitors on the courts, but close sisters above all.

LAPL Blog 5 Picture Books About Serena and Venus Williams
Kadie Seitz, Librarian, Youth Services, Friday, June 3, 2022









 


California Nouns: People, Places, and Things
Serena and Venus Williams
If you’ve visited the children’s nonfiction sports section lately, you may have noticed a growing number of picture book biographies of Compton’s own Venus and Serena Williams. But which one(s) should you and your little one check out? From tales of sisterly love to the highs and lows of competition, let this blog post be your guide to some of the best.







Sisters: Venus and Serena Williams 
Winter, Jeanette
Sisters provides a good overview of Serena and Venus’ life, especially focusing on their resiliency and ability to overcome adversity—whether that be socio-economic, racial or physical. What makes it especially heartwarming, though, is its emphasis on their sisterly bond through it all. With warm and engaging illustrations, make this your pick if you want to emphasize positive sibling relationships. Recommended for ages 3+.
Fun fact: Venus Williams fought for equal pay for women players at Wimbledon.

Sisters & Champions: The Story of Venus and Serena Williams 
Bryant, Howard 
The more you learn about the Williams sisters, the more you understand how important family is to them. Sisters and Champions really highlights how much their father Richard encouraged and supported them early on, even while facing derision and racism. The soft, almost photorealistic illustrations lend the book a lot of warmth. Make this your pick if you’re interested in strong father-daughter relationships and Black Girl Magic. Recommended for ages 4+.Fun fact: Serena’s 23 total Grand Slam singles titles are the most for both women and men during the open era.

Game Changers: The Story of Venus and Serena Williams
Cline-Ransome, Lesa 
If you read one picture book about the early life of Venus and Serena Williams, this is probably your best bet. Game Changers does an excellent and thorough job detailing their childhood, training and early wins. What stands out most, however, might just be the excellent collage illustrations, which give readers a sense of motion and growth, while also providing lots of little details to discover. Make this your pick if you’re interested in the sisters’ early life. Recommended for ages 4+.
Fun fact: In 2009, Venus and Serena became minority owners of the Miami Dolphins. This made the sisters the first African-American women to obtain ownership in an NFL franchise.

Game, Set, Sisters!: The Story of Venus and Serena Williams 
Leslie, Jay
While Game Changers is a strong choice for learning about the sisters’ early lives, Game, Set, Sisters! covers their adulthood accomplishments on and off the court just as excellently. Readers learn of their early wins, but also the challenges they faced—like the untimely death of a sister and unexpected illness. Ultimately, though, these challenges allowed them to grow and give back to Compton, the community they grew up in. Make this your pick if you want to learn more about the sisters’ adulthood and community work. Recommended for ages 4+.
Fun fact: Venus has earned college degrees in fashion and business.

Serena: The Littlest Sister 
Gray, Karlin
Being the youngest sibling can be tough, especially when your older siblings are stars. This book details the early years of the Williams sisters and their family, but focuses most on Serena, the youngest sister. Serena loved being the center of attention, and yearned to compete in tournaments with her sister, even when her dad told her she was too young. How will she prove herself? Make this your pick for youngest siblings yearning to be seen. Recommended for ages 8+.
Fun fact: In addition to English, Serena also speaks conversational French and knows some Spanish and Italian.

EXCERPT: 'On The Line' - ABC News

















ABC NewsVideoLiveShowsGuns in AmericaInterest Successfully AddedWe'll notify you here with news aboutTurn on desktop notifications for breaking stories about interest? OffOnLOG INStream onEXCERPT: 'On The Line'Read an excerpt from Serena Williams' new book.ByABC News September 14, 2009, 1:57 PMSept. 15, 2009&#151; -- Serena Williams has won every major title in tennis. In her memoir, "On The Line," Williams describes how she worked her way up to become one of the top women's players worldwide.For Williams, tennis practice first started in the tough neighborhood of Compton, Calif., where her father trained her on public tennis courts filled with broken glass. Over the years, she has had to overcome injury and cope with her sister's tragic shooting. Off the court, she has made her mark in philanthropy, fashion, television and film using her trademark determination.Read an excerpt of the book below and head to the "GMA" Library for more good reads.Chapter OneRide a Little, Bump a LittleMy first tennis memory? People always ask about it, but I'm afraid I don't have one. I just remember playing, all the time. It's like tennis was always there, like going to services at Kingdom Hall. Like breathing.I saw a picture once of Venus pushing me in a stroller on a tennis court, but I don't actually remember this moment. I've seen pictures of me holding a racquet taken around the time I started to walk. I don't remember those moments, either. I've heard all the stories, of course. The ones that have somehow passed into urban tennis legend, and the ones that still get kicked around in my family. Some of them are even true.Best anyone can recall: I was three years old. It was a Saturday afternoon, maybe Sunday. My parents took us out to the public courts at a park in Lynwood, California, not far from where we lived. It was a total family affair. There was me, my older sister Venus, and my mom and dad, together with our older sisters Lyndrea, Isha, and Yetunde. The older girls had been playing for a time, while I had been trudging along, but then one day my dad announced that I was ready to take my swings, too. He put a standard, regulation-size racquet in my hand and positioned me a couple feet from the net. Then he climbed to the other side and started soft-tossing until I managed to hit a couple over."Just look at the ball, Serena," he kept saying, in that patient tone and sweet Louisiana drawl I'd come to hear in my dreams. "Just swing."Years later, he took to calling me Meeka—a variation on my middle name, Jameka. Tunde pinned that nickname on me when I was about six and it stuck, and I used to love to hear it from my father. He still calls me Meeka, and whenever he does it puts me in mind of how things were between us when I was little, when I was first learning to really play. Say what you will about my dad (and folks have said an awful lot over the years), he had a gentle demeanor when he wanted to, especially when we were just starting out. He made a game out of it, encouraging me to swing as hard as I could. Didn't matter to him where I hit the ball, or how I hit it, just that I hit it.After every toss, he'd offer a word of encouragement, a point of praise:"Good job, Serena.""Way to go.""That's it."My sisters looked on and cheered and chased the balls I missed or hit to the next court. They'd been down this way before, taking their own first hits—Venus, just a year or so before. I'd been around the court long enough to know what I was supposed to do. It was just my turn, is all. At last. Wasn't any kind of ceremony to it. Wasn't really any kind of big deal, except when I look back and see how far I've come—how far we've all come, really. My sister Isha even remembers what I was wearing: a white tennis skirt, with gathers in the middle, decorated with pink, gray, and purple flowers; my hair braided in cornrows and bunched in a ponytail at the top of my head. Even then, I was styling. We didn't have money for proper tennis clothes, but I wanted to look good.I was tiny. People have a hard time believing this, considering how tall I am now. Venus was always tall for her age, but I was way on the small side. That regulation racquet was probably bigger than I was, but we couldn't afford a junior racquet. Over the years, I've wondered if that might have put some kind of stamp on the way I played, taking my very first swings with a racquet that was too big for me. Maybe that was the first instance of my dad setting things up so that success was something I had to reach for. It might be there for the taking, but I would have to rise to meet it.My parents taught themselves the game so they could teach it to us. It's one of the first things people mention when they talk about my career or Venus's—and yet for some reason it's not always seen as a positive. I don't get that, because there's nothing wrong with learning about something and passing it on to your children. Yes, it was a calculated move. At some point my dad was watching a match on television, and he couldn't believe how much money these women were making, just for hitting a tennis ball. He's told the story so often it's been burned into me. He was watching a match being played by Virginia Ruzici, the 1978 French Open champion. The announcer mentioned that Ruzici had just earned $40,000 during one week of tournament play—more than my dad had earned all year. It didn't fi t with how hard he worked for a living, how hard my mom worked, how hard it was for everyone they knew to get and keep ahead. And so the story goes that my dad went out the next morning to pick up a newspaper to confirm Ruzici's earnings, to see for himself if tennis players could actually make so much money in such a short stretch of time. When it turned out to be true, he came home and said to my mother, "We need to make two more kids and make them into tennis superstars."At least that's the line he used to tell reporters after Venus and I started playing on the tour. It became a real fish-out-of-water story and a symbol of what people can do with a little vision and determination, when they reach beyond what they know for something new.Now, tell me: what's wrong with that? Coming upon some rewarding new path your kids might follow and pointing them in the right direction? Doesn't seem to me there's anything to criticize here, but people are certainly quick to criticize, don't you think? In any case, I'm sure the story of how my family came to tennis has been embellished over the years, but at its core that's just what happened. And there's been some resentment layered onto it as well, because for whatever reason there's this notion that if you didn't grow up around the game, if it wasn't in your blood to begin with, you had no real claim on it. Tennis is like that, I'm afraid. There's a sense of entitlement, of belonging. Like you have to be born to it. Like you have to play it at a high level, before you can teach it. For the longest time, it was that sense of entitlement that probably kept a whole group of potentially talented minority and underprivileged kids from taking up the game. It must have felt to them like a sport of advantage—and I guess it was. Indeed, I've always believed that sense of entitlement is reinforced by the language of the game: advantage me!No, the doors to the game weren't really closed on anyone, but they were essentially closed. If your parents didn't play, there was no reason for you to play. If no one in your community played, you'd never think to reach for a racquet in the first place. If you couldn't afford to be a member of some fancy country club, it might never occur to you to pick up a tennis racquet and teach yourself the game on some public court. But my dad saw tennis as a way to open doors for his daughters, probably thinking that the more doors that were open to us the better, so he ordered some instructional books and videos and taught himself the game. His idea was to kind of make it up as he went along. He'd do his homework, borrow what he liked from this or that coach, and find his own way to pass it on to his daughters.My mother was pregnant with Venus at the time, and she was out on the court with my dad, working on her forehand and learning drills, technique, strategy. They were both good athletes, so the tennis came easy. They were both strong, physical, coordinated. They took to it right away. Before long, they felt like they could hit well enough to demonstrate proper technique and game strategy. The idea, my dad took to saying, was to teach his girls to be champions, just like the professional players he saw on television—like Virginia Ruzici!—but that really came later. That was part of the lore that attached to my family after we started to have some success. The mental toughness, the single-minded focus, the positive affirmations, the mind of a champion . . . all that came later, too, after we took to the sport and started to show some talent for it.Absolutely, Daddy believed tennis was our ticket up and out of Compton, the rough-and-tumble neighborhood in Los Angeles where we lived, but he also knew we had to take to it. He knew it wasn't enough to simply teach us the game and train us to be champions. If that was all it took, then everyone would be doing it. We had to have some God-given talent and athletic ability. We had to develop a passion for the game and an iron will to succeed, and all these things would take time presenting themselves. Or not. And so at first tennis was just something to do, a way for us to be together as a family.Don't get me wrong: tennis became a real focus for us. Very quickly. It became Daddy's focus, certainly. And what a lot of people don't realize is my mom was with him every step of the way. This was her deal, too. It wasn't just that she supported my dad's vision. She saw what he saw; she wanted what he wanted; she worked for it just as much as he did. She had her own ideas on how we should train—and even now, she's one of the best at helping to break down my game and figure out what's working and what's not. When I was little, I actually spent more time hitting with my mom than I did with my dad. Venus was usually on the next court with my dad. And then, when it was time for my older sisters to hit, Venus and I would start picking up balls for them.We all played, all the time. It was our thing. It got to where people would know we'd be out there on those courts every day after school. There were just two courts at the park in Compton, so the few recreational players there would know to get their games in during the day, because when three o'clock rolled around Richard Williams would be pulling up in his Volkswagen minibus, dirty yellow with a white top, with his five girls spilling out onto those courts like they had their names on them. There were a few more courts at the park in Lynwood—maybe six—but we always used the two at the back, and the people there knew we'd be coming, too. It's not like there were too many people playing tennis on those public courts back then. If it happened that the courts were occupied when we arrived, we waited our turn. We'd do some drills, or some stretching off to the side, maybe work on our swings. My dad never minded the wait. His thing was: no problem, we'll fill the time.The courts themselves were in sorry shape. There was broken glass every here and there. Cracks in the cement. Weeds poking through. Soda cans, beer bottles, fast-food wrappers . . . I've read articles that say there was drug paraphernalia littering those courts and that we girls had to sweep the syringes and tubes and plastic bags out of the way before we could play, but I don't remember any of that. When I ask my dad about this, he says, "Why you want to dwell on the negative, Meeka?" In other articles it says we could hear gunshots ringing out while we were playing, from all the drive-by shootings. That I remember full well, only the shots themselves didn't sound all that terrifying until I learned what they were. At first, I just thought someone was setting off firecrackers or popping some balloons, but once I learned what the sound meant it would shake me up pretty good. "Never mind the noise, Meeka," Daddy used to say whenever gunfire rang out. "Just play."Wasn't exactly Center Court at Roland Garros, but it was all we knew.We bounced around a lot, from public court to public court. There was one place we used to play that had these great chain link nets. You'd drill a ball into the net, and you'd rattle the cage and feel like you really accomplished something—even though we were supposed to hit it over the net, of course. My dad tried to mix it up for us, but for the most part those courts in Lynwood and Compton were our home base. We branched out, though—and if we didn't like a certain park, or a certain neighborhood, we wouldn't go back.Once, at Lynwood Park, a group of kids started giving us a hard time. I was probably five or six. Venus and I were hitting. My sisters were chasing balls. I don't remember what my parents were doing, but they must have been there, somewhere. These kids kept taunting us. They called us Blackie One and Blackie Two. It was so cruel, so arbitrary, but we kept playing. Finally, Tunde stopped chasing balls and chased these kids instead. She was the oldest, so she felt a responsibility to look after us. She had our backs. I don't know what she said to these kids when she caught up to them, but they didn't bother us anymore after that.As kids, I don't think we heard those taunts as racist remarks. They were just taunts. Those kids were just being mean. If Venus and I had been more typical California golden girls, these kids might have called us Blondie One and Blondie Two. We were just different; that's how I took it at the time. We stood out. Might have been something more to it than that, but I was too young to recognize it. But maybe Tunde heard these remarks a little differently, and that's why she chased these boys down.However it happened, and whatever it meant, I looked on and thought, Someday, Serena, you won't need your sisters to fight your battles for you.Over time, Daddy collected all this equipment—ball hoppers, carts, cones, whatever he could find to make our sessions more like the ones in his books and videos. He really tried to create a professional environment for us on a nothing budget. For a while, the routine was we had to take out the middle seat in our van so my dad could fit the shopping cart he'd somehow managed to acquire, which he would fill with tennis balls and wheel out to the court. We must have made an odd picture, crammed into the van like that with a shopping cart. I'd sit up front with Venus, sharing a seat belt. The big girls sat in back. The cart would be jammed in the middle, alongside a couple brooms so we could sweep the court. It always felt to me like we were rumbling along in that van from Scooby Doo, our equipment jammed in so tight we'd have to stick our arms and legs out the windows to make room.My mom would usually meet us at the courts after work. Eventually, it got a little tiresome lugging that cart back and forth each day with all the rest of our gear, so my father started locking the cart to the rusty fence surrounding the court. Saved us a lot of time and trouble. This was another example of my parents' approach: when something worked, they stayed with it; when it no longer made sense, they tried something else. We still took the balls home with us every night, in buckets and boxes and milk crates and whatever else we could find to carry them, but now it was much more efficient; now they took up a lot less room.Man, those balls were precious to us. They were like money in the bank. I don't recall that we ever retired a ball from our collection. Daddy would take the oldest, baldest, flattest balls and turn them into a drill. He'd keep them in the mix with all the other balls, but when he pitched one of these special balls to us he said it would help us with our speed, our footwork, our concentration. I hated going after those balls—they just wouldn't bounce!—but Daddy kept them in play."At Wimbledon," he'd say, "the balls will bounce low, just like these special balls, so you have to be ready."Occasionally, we'd hit a ball into the woods or out onto the street beyond the fence, and we'd have to go looking for it before giving it up for lost. I hit more balls over the fence than my sisters—not by accident, necessarily, but by design. See, I discovered that when Daddy sent me across the street to collect the ball after one of my errant shots, it meant a break from the hard work he had us doing on the court, so I learned to play the angles at an early age.Also occasionally, Daddy would add a new can or two to our collection, and that was always a real treat. Those fresh balls really popped. You could follow them all afternoon, up against the faded yellow of all those tired old tennis balls. It always felt like I had to bear down a little harder whenever a fresh ball reached the top of the pile and was put in play; there was a little more hop to it; it bounced off my racquet with a little more purpose and authority. Plus, it sounded great—the music of the game. I never liked to waste one of those new balls with a bad shot. It was like a missed opportunity. New balls are like that. To this day, whenever I smell a can of just-opened balls it puts me in mind of those new cans my dad used to bring out, when those brand-new balls made me feel like a real tennis player. They were so clean, so yellow, the felt so fine like the hairs on the back of your head . . . it was almost a shame to get them dirty.Of course, they all got dirty, eventually. Soon, they'd lose that fresh bounce and they'd get all dirty and there'd be no telling the new balls from the ones at the bottom of the pile—but that didn't mean we stopped playing. No, sir. It only meant we'd have to get all these other balls to pop with the same purpose and authority, until my father could get us a couple new cans.That was the way of things for the first while. We developed our own little routine, our own little family dynamic, built around this funny little game. We were little girls smacking a ball around inside a box, that's what Daddy used to say. And, at first, that's all it was. But then we started showing flashes that we could really play, when I was about five or six and Venus about six or seven, so my parents changed things up on us. They went at it harder. They pushed us harder. That might have been their plan all along, but they didn't go harder until we showed them we were ready. And when we were, we went from playing just a couple hours a day four or five times a week, to three or four hours a day every day of the week. Some days, we'd even be out for two-a-day sessions, starting up at six o'clock in the morning before school, and then again after school, usually until dark. In the morning, we'd sometimes get to the court before the sun was all the way up, and Daddy would have us stretch or practice our swings until we could see well enough to hit.I still do that, by the way—head out to practice at first light. It's my favorite time to hit, because everything's so quiet; you've got the whole day in front of you. I hate getting up early—really!!!—but I push myself. You can put in a full day's work before your opponent even gets out of bed, and that can give you an incredible psychological edge to carry into your next match, knowing you're fully prepared, knowing the other girl is sleeping in while you're out there sweating. And in those moments when I'm waiting for the sun to finish rising I'll think back to those early mornings on those public courts in Compton and Lynwood, keeping busy until my dad gave us the nod to start playing.It got to be a grueling schedule, but none of us really minded it. Or we hardly noticed. We were all together. It was what we did, that's all. We didn't know any different. We didn't have a whole lot of friends outside of school. There was only time for each other, for tennis. My dad tried to make it fun for us. Every session had a theme, a structure. He'd set up all these creative games, with cones placed around the court, and there'd be a series of challenges we'd have to meet. Sometimes he'd put up little messages or sayings on the fence around the court to help motivate us, or maybe just to make us smile.If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.Believe.You are a winner.Be humble.Say "Thank you."(This last saying was one of his favorites.)He'd write out these empowering messages on big pieces of paper or oak tag, or sometimes he'd have us write them out. Then he'd hang them up all around the court. If there was a theme to one of his sessions—like "Focus"—all the messages would have to do with the theme. He really put a lot of time and effort into this part of our training, because he believed it was important. He wanted these messages to resonate, for the visual image of the word to linger in our minds long after we'd left the court. Years later, when we moved to Florida, he had some signs made professionally, with his most effective messages—and those he put up permanently.Basically, he was fooling us into thinking we weren't working, with all those games and messages, but after a while we caught on. We didn't care, though. We didn't mind working hard. I mean, we were kids, so of course we grumbled from time to time. Of course we did our little celebration dance whenever it rained, because that meant we wouldn't have to practice. Of course I hit a ball or two over the fence to buy myself a break while I went to retrieve it. But it wasn't so bad. Every now and then, my dad would reward us with some time to play in the nearby playground, or in the sandbox. That was another great treat for us girls. I used to love doing cartwheels. Whenever I had a five-minute break, I'd be in the grass alongside the court, flipping around. I spent a lot of time on the monkey bars, too, as I recall.Even when we weren't playing tennis, our games were tennis related.  One of our very favorite family games was UNO, which I always thought was fitting for us. We played that game all the time—and I mean all the time!—and it really instilled a champion type mind-set. After all, the point of the whole game is right there in its name—to be number one! No, UNO's got nothing to do with tennis, not directly, but it's a great teaching tool for any individual sport. It instills such a killer mind-set. Every game produces a winner, but UNO is one of the few games I can think of where you need to announce yourself as the winner just before you actually win, when you're down to one card, so everyone else around the table has a shot at you. It goes from every-girl-for-herself to every-girl-gunning-for-the-leader in a flash, and in this way it can really prepare you for the kind of competition you might face in a crowded tournament field. At first, it's just on you to take care of your own game, but then everyone is looking to knock you down. I don't know if my parents had this in mind when they introduced us to the game, but that's the way I always played it.Sometimes, our competitions were more straightforward. When it was just us girls, playing in the yard at home, we used to play a game called Grand Slam. Usually it was me and Venus and Lyn. I don't know how we came up with it. Basically, it was like box ball, or four square. We'd hit a tennis ball back and forth with our hands. The court was just a square on the sidewalk. If the ball hit the grass, it was out. Sometimes, we threw some dirt on the sidewalk and it became a clay court—the French Open. Then we might throw down some grass—Wimbledon. I won so many majors right there in Compton, all because my dad had us thinking, breathing, living tennis so much it seeped into our regular childhood games.It was everywhere and all around. As I look back on those moments playing hand-tennis with my sisters in front of our house at 1117 East Stockton Street in Compton, California, it puts me in mind of something my mom used to say when we were kids. "Whatever you become," she always said, "you become in your head first." That was a real mantra for her. Daddy took to saying it, too. Whatever it was we wanted to do or become, they'd tell us to see ourselves doing it, becoming it. It's tied in to what my dad was trying to do, getting us to visualize those words in our minds once we stepped away from his posters and signs. When Isha came home one day and announced she wanted to be a lawyer, my mom said, "That's great, Isha. Now go and be a lawyer in your head and the rest will follow." It was the same with tennis—even hand-tennis. We couldn't become champions for real until we became champions in our heads, and here we were, little kids, winning Wimbledon, winning the French Open, and willing it so.* * *It wasn't long before we sisters started making some serious noise on the local tennis scene. My father hadn't known a whole lot about that world going in, but he was a quick study. He always said he had a master plan for us—and that he was "a master planner"—and part of that plan was to collect whatever tennis insights he could find. He moved about by touch and feel; he added to our game plan by borrowing from the game plans of others; mostly, he watched local pros and picked up ideas and strategies for his sessions with us. By the time I was seven going on eight, and Venus was eight going on nine, Daddy was scouting area tournaments and academies, and following the comings and goings of all the young players in and around Los Angeles. It was a competitive environment—and a close-knit community. Everyone knew everyone else, so it's no wonder people started to pay attention to what he was doing with his girls on these courts all around Los Angeles. Our home courts might have been neglected and underused, but as we bounced around we turned a couple heads, that's for sure.For one thing, there weren't a whole lot of African-American tennis players on the circuit at any age. That goes back to the entitlement or privilege that attached to the sport. For another, you didn't see too many entire families on those public courts. There were seven of us; we couldn't help but turn heads, and over time Daddy got to talking to all these people and tapping in to whatever was going on in L.A. for kids playing tennis. This was an important part of our development, and the first time we got any kind of exposure as players.He signed us up for all these different events. One day when I was seven he came home and told us we'd be hitting with Billie Jean King, and of course we all knew who she was. Another big part of Daddy's grand plan was to get us to learn the game by watching the pros. He had us watching so much tennis on television, talking all the time about all these great players, that we were terribly excited. We thought Billie Jean would be hitting with just us, but that's not at all how it happened. There was a clinic, organized by World Team Tennis, and Billie Jean was one of the featured participants.Even so, it was a big, big day for us. I remember going through our closet with Venus, trying to pick out just the right outfit, because even then I was into how I looked on the court. (In Compton, all five of us shared a closet, so it was always a frenzied time when we were scrambling to find something to wear.) We didn't really have proper tennis clothes, but we wanted to make a good impression. Lyn and Isha played that day, too. We all fussed over what to wear, and then, when we finally got to the clinic and started playing, Billie Jean actually walked over to us during one of the drills. I'm sure she was just being a good ambassador for the sport, making special time on each court with each group of kids—just like I try to do now when I'm asked to participate in one of these clinics, because of Billie Jean's example—but it felt to us like she'd come over just to watch us play. Like she'd heard about us and wanted to check us out. That was the kind of confidence our parents instilled in us when it came to tennis; that was how they had us thinking: there were the Williams sisters, and there was everyone else. Over and over, they kept telling us we were champions, that everyone in tennis would know who we were, and on and on. After a while, we started to believe them, but here at this World Team Tennis event it was too soon for all of that. This was just Billie Jean, making the rounds, working with as many kids as she could. She didn't know us from any other group of sisters out there on that court.Unfortunately, the meeting meant more to me when I was looking forward to it than it did when I was in the middle of it, because I didn't play too well when Billie Jean was hitting to me. Plus, Venus did such a good job when it was her turn, so that made it even worse. I panicked, I guess. (I was so nervous!) I think I hit every shot long or into the net, but that's how it goes sometimes. You look ahead to some meaningful moment and set it up in your mind like it's going to be this huge, consequential deal, and then it just fizzles. The trick, really, is to find some takeaway moment in the fizzle and carry that with you instead, and here I managed to shrug off that I'd played so poorly and ended up crying because Venus played so well, and remember instead that I got to hit with the great Billie Jean King. That alone was pretty huge and consequential.I think back on that Billie Jean King moment every time I look forward to an event or a milestone or a special opportunity. Why?  Because it grounds me. It reminds me that we can take pleasure and pride in the thrill of anticipation, but at the same time we must be careful not to invest too heavily into any one situation, in case it doesn't work out the way we've planned. That's life, right? We get disappointed from time to time. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't look forward to anything, or even that we should keep our expectations reasonable. Not at all. What it means for me is to aim high and to know that if I fall short of the mark it was still worth doing. Whatever it happens to be, if it's worth looking forward to it, if it's worth taking aim, it's worth doing.We went to tournaments from time to time. I remember watching Gabriella Sabatini, and thinking she was so tall and so beautiful, but at the same time thinking, Man, I can beat that girl. That's where my head was at as a kid. My parents had me thinking I was invincible. Gabriella wasn't built like the other girls on the tour; she was big and powerful, almost majestic. I kept staring at her and wondering if I would ever be that tall, that graceful, that powerful.Another time, about a year or so after that World Team Tennis event with Billie Jean King, we hit with Zina Garrison and Lori McNeil. Here I would have been about eight years old, and these two great players were pretty much it in terms of role models for African-American girls on the tennis court. They were doubles partners, so they had a real rapport. This time, it actually was a special opportunity my dad had arranged. It wasn't any kind of clinic. It was just us, and Zina Garrison and Lori McNeil. I don't know how Daddy pulled this off, but he did. There I was, still a tiny little thing, thinking I could take it to these two great players. I actually thought I could beat them—that's how confident Venus and I were in our games. But then we started hitting and I thought, There's just no way. Oh my God, Zina and Lori were so strong! So quick! We couldn't hang with them at all, of course, but that was cool. That was just the silent fuel I'd need to put in the tank to keep me going to the next level.There was another great program my father found for us in L.A. around the same time: "Youth vs. Experience." The way it was set up was they paired an older player, usually someone with experience on the tour, with an up-and-coming kid. Some of the older players were good club players or local teaching pros, and some were former tour professionals. I'd never heard of the lady I played against, so it wasn't any kind of big deal, but Venus drew a woman named Dodo Cheney, who'd actually won the Australian Championship back in 1938. Dodo Cheney was probably in her seventies when she played Venus, and Venus took it to her. She really did. My old lady beat me pretty soundly, but Venus beat her.I mention this because Venus was really the first to make a name for herself, and it was largely through outings like this one—and her usual strong showings in local tournaments. I still remember the very first article written about Venus. We all remember it, because it set in motion one of our favorite family adventures—or misadventures, I should say. The article was in a local newspaper, the Compton Gazette. Here again, I was about seven or eight. The article was about Venus, mostly, but it was also about all of us. How we trained together on the public courts around town. How our parents taught themselves the game. How the tennis world was expecting great things. And on and on.Daddy was so proud when the story came out that he wanted to grab as many copies of the paper as he could for souvenirs. His idea was to drive around to all the houses in our community on the morning the papers were delivered and swipe them from people's yards. Not the most neighborly solution, to be sure. Not the most practical, either. I mean, here he was, excited that we were finally getting this positive publicity for our tennis, and at the same time negating all that publicity by taking away all those newspapers so folks couldn't read about us. He could have just called the Compton Gazette office and asked for some copies, or gone to the local drugstore and bought as many as he needed for about twenty cents apiece, but these options never occurred to him.So off we went, on our family paper-grab. It wasn't the most logical operation. Daddy would drive the van up and down the street, and whenever he spotted one of those rolled-up newspapers on some driveway or front walk, he'd pull over, get out of the car, and scamper over and swipe the paper. Then he'd race back to the car and drive off. It was such an absurd scene, and we girls were sitting in the back of the van, giggling about it, until finally Isha suggested that they could hit a lot more houses if she was the one doing the driving. The rest of us weren't too happy with this idea, because it meant we'd collect all the papers we needed that much sooner, and after that we might have to go and practice. As it was, we were missing practice for this, and whenever we missed practice, for the weather or for any other reason, it was something to celebrate.My father thought about this awhile and agreed this might be a better approach. At the very least, he might get us back on the practice court that much sooner. Only trouble was, Isha was just thirteen and couldn't drive. She said, "How hard can it be, Daddy?"Daddy said, "Are you sure?"Isha said, "Yes, Daddy. I can do it. I can do it."That's how it was with us girls. Nothing was out of reach.So that was the plan. Wasn't a very good plan, but it was a plan.  Isha got behind the wheel. I climbed into the backseat with Venus and Lyn. Daddy walked alongside the van, and off we went. Only we didn't get very far. Isha had some idea what she was doing, but not a lot. She didn't have a great concept of space or depth or any of those things you figure out when you're an experienced driver.She didn't understand how close she was to the cars parked on the side of the street, and she proceeded to run right into one of them.  And then another. Took off a couple side mirrors along the way. It was crazy!Daddy had managed to collect a couple papers before Isha started to lose control of the van, but now he was running alongside and yelling for Isha to step on the brakes. He was yelling, but mostly to be heard. Underneath the loud voice, he was surprisingly calm. He said, "Hit the brake, Isha." And then, when she did, he came up to her window and said, "Are you okay?" His tone was soft; he wasn't mad. Anyway, he didn't sound mad, and that was always one of the nicest, most reassuring things about my dad. We were just kids, so I'm sure we set him off from time to time, but he would just take a deep breath and let his frustration pass and then deal with whatever it was in a calm, patient manner.Meanwhile, in the backseat, the three of us were trying to climb out the window. We were so scared! Isha was crying, crying, crying. Daddy was more embarrassed than anything else. Frustrated, too, because his plan had somehow backfired. Now he had to wait out there in the street and talk to all these people whose cars Isha had hit. Can you imagine! We didn't mention that we took their newspapers, just that we hit their cars, and then we had to drive over to the ATM to take out money to reimburse them for the damage, money we didn't really have to spare. I think it cost us over one hundred dollars, when if we had bought the papers at the newsstand it would have just been five or six dollars.We laughed about it, though. Right away, we laughed about it.We sat in the back and turned it into a song. Lyn made it up to poke fun at Isha, but we all joined in soon enough. We sang: "Ride a little, bump a little, tear the mirror off a little . . ." It came with its own little singsong melody. It got to be a long-running joke in our family, one of those Greatest Hits–type stories you take out and tell over and over again. Isha gets all red-faced whenever we bring it up, whenever we start singing, because it certainly wasn't her finest moment, but even now, all these years later, that little song can get us going. One of us will fall in to singing, and the others will chime in, and at the other end we'll just laugh and laugh and remember what it was like out there in Compton, back when we were all still making it up as we went along, learning the game by touch and feel, on some level knowing our world was about to open up for us in a big-time way.Top StoriesTrump indictment live updates: Trump speaks out on charges from Mar-a-LagoApr 4, 10:59 PMRead the full transcript from Trump's arraignmentApr 4, 10:55 PMWhat legal experts say about Donald Trump's indictmentApr 4, 9:54 PMMichigan family welcomes 1st daughter in over 130 yearsApr 5, 4:04 AMFatalities reported in Missouri as tornado threat torments US3 minutes agoABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact UsCopyright © 2023 ABC News Internet Ventures.

Desperate to escape their brutal grandfather, Laurie and Buddy hop a train clanging west and become fall in with a hobo named Way after he saves them from a sinister tramp.  In California, the children find only heartbreak, so they and Way set out for Texas in the hopes of reuniting with Johnny Morrigan. Like the fellow travelers they encounter on the roads and rails crisscrossing America, Laurie, Buddy, and Way take joy in simple pleasures such as a campfire meal, a starry night, and a song.

At last, in lusty Texas oil field towns, they find work, Morrigan, and a deadly menace as Laurie grows from innocent girl to vibrant woman. A riveting story of hardship, adventure, and romance, pays glorious tribute to the men and women who kept the American dream alive during the Great Depression.GenresHistorical FictionFictionHistorical405 pages, Kindle EditionFirst published February 1, 1993 Book details & editionsLoading interface...Loading interface...About the authorJeanne Williams84 books16 followersPseudonyms: Megan Castell, Jeanne Crecy, Jeanne Foster, Deirdre Rowan, Kristian Michaels, J.R.

The hardships of the dust bowl and the Great Depression were brought to life for me. I’d seen the Ken Burns series, and this was exactly what the people in Kansas and Oklahoma lived through. It seemed almost like Grapes of Wrath, one of my favorite American novels of all time. I loved the children, Laurie and Buddy, as they “lit out for the territories” hoping to get to California and find their dad. They showed such spunk, riding the rails and finding a way to get what they needed to survive. The people they met along the way were almost mythic: Way is the flawed savior, travelling with the kids and protecting them from dangerous people. Morrrigan is the muse, opening the world of music to Laurie and also providing her with a safe way to make money.The problems I had with the book was the road was too long. I wasn’t nearly as interested in the oil fields as I was with these plucky and resourceful children. I liked the evil grandfather’s wife, and the role she played in ameliorating his verbal poison. I had some trouble with the father leaving the children with such a nasty old man, but he was obviously at his wits end and mourning the very recent death of their mother.These are minor problems. I did enjoy the book very much and will recommend it to my young adult friends who know little of this era. I received an ARC from NetGalley and Open Road in exchange for an honest review.8 likesLike CommentKathryn Young78 reviewsJanuary 28, 2013This was a story of a strong-willed young girl who loses her father and mother in the dust bowl of Oklahoma and travels by train with her younger brother to California and back, encountering a lot of interesting people and adventures along the way. Lots of historical information about America's dust bowl, the lead up to World War II, hobo life and more. A little sentimental, but still enjoyable read.5 likesLike CommentBonnye Reed4,019 reviews67 followersMay 28, 2019NGAB I received a free electronic copy of this novel from Netgalley, Jeanne Williams, and Open Road Integrated Media. Thank you for sharing your work with me.This was an excellent novel. I read a lot, and it has been a long time since I encountered a novel I hated to see end. Ms. Williams keeps her story crisp, her protagonists balanced and well rounded, and folds her tale seamlessly into the world of oil and dust and war we know as the southwestern United States in the 1930's - 1940's. This is an exciting journey through the hardships and joys, the tribulations and exaltations of that time. It is a story that lifted me, and I will read again in time. I was pleased to see that several of Ms. Williams novels are being reprinted - the perfect time to find and add her to my list of must-read authors.Pub date July 5,2016keepers kindle-or-pdf4 likesLike CommentHeather349 reviews21 followersJanuary 18, 2013I am a HUGE Patty Duke fan. I mean huge. I've met her several times and even my license plate says PDUKEFN. Knowing she narrated this was the only reason I got this from audible but I'm glad I did. I was first concerned that I would be distracted by Patty Duke's narration but it was a GREAT story! I really enjoyed it and she was a fantastic narrator. So good, I often forgot that's why I picked this book! The story starts in the dust bowl of the 1930s and the hardships remind me of my granny and her family in Kentucky (although a completely different region and circumstances but it felt like something like how my Granny and her family lived). Would definitely pick up another by this author. Also, Anna (Patty Duke) needs to do more books. Really...audio2 likes1 commentLike CommentMandy3,123 reviews265 followersSeptember 6, 2016Not for me this one. The premise is potentially engaging – two young children making their way in Dust Bowl America – but the writing just wasn’t up to it. It’s a nice enough story, I suppose, if with some rather improbable plot twists, but the author is far too fond of letting her characters explain the historical background so that their speech sounds false and unnatural. It’s all a bit too romanticised as well – I imagine life was a lot harder than the way Williams depicts it. It’s not enough to describe poverty – you have to make the reader feel it. And the central child character is just too good to be true. So I had to give this one up, unfortunately. 2 likesLike CommentPolly Krize1,888 reviews38 followersJuly 18, 2016I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.The cruel effects of the Great Depression send twelve-year old Laurie and her young brother Buddy out on the highways of America to live with their grandfather in Oklahoma's panhandle. To escape his brutality, they hop a train to California, which leads to more heartbreak. The songs of Johnny Morrigan inspire them to keep their hopes up, leading them to Texas, Morrigan and life-changing events. Recommended reading.2 likesLike CommentDebbie796 reviews13 followersDecember 20, 2018 According to my Good Reads statistics for this year, The Longest Road was the least popular book I read with only 245 people reading it. A lot of people are missing out on a great read! The Longest Road reminded me of the Grapes of Wrath – except that it is a lighter, less depressing version told from a young girl’s perspective. Laurie and her younger brother are left with their grandfather in Oklahoma after the death of their mother. Their father has headed to California hoping for work. Laurie and her brother take off after him, hopping freight trains and receiving help from kind strangers along their journey. Music plays an important role in this book and there’s a great deal of information on popular songs during this era. The book also included details about the Dust Bowl, politics, World War II and oil drilling. I loved the plot twists – every time it seems that Laurie and Buddy find some happiness and security in their lives something happens to throw their futures in jeopardy. This truly is a Great American read that I hope more people will read and enjoy.1 likeLike CommentDon1,081 reviews11 followersMay 8, 2010 For the most part I enjoyed The Longest Road. I listened to it and that may have been a mistake. It is read by Patty Duke, so I thought that would add to the book. However at times her voice(s) was too squeaky and irritating, pretty much an uneven performance. The only fault I would find with the story is that at times the author lists off a series of events as if the reader was completely ignorant of the time period in which the story takes place. The ending was a little anticlimatic, but overall a good story.1 likeLike CommentNancy1,409 reviews317 followersJuly 7, 2016I had great trouble sticking to this book, setting it aside for days or a week then trying it again. The idea of a girl learning to be a folk singer during the Dust Bowl could have been such a great story, but this novel missed the mark for me. I did not think the writing was good and the plot was often improbable. I really wanted to like it, many left such nice reviews and the idea was appealing. For me it just didn't work.did-not-finish1 likeLike CommentGaye72 reviews1 followerFebruary 5, 2018Really Enjoyed This BookThe story takes place during the dust bowl and WW2. The times were difficult for many, but the main character has bad and good things happen in her life and meets a lot of good and a few bad people. She is mature and has good judgement for someone so young. She is very likable and it’s fun to follow her ups and downs. Some parts of the book seemed a little improbable or might have rated it 5 Star.1 likeLike CommentJenny Lyon5 reviewsOctober 29, 2020I learnt a lot about the history of the ‘Dust Bowl’ disaster and The Great Depression of the early 1900’s in America.It was an engrossing story of 2 young children’s survival and their desperate journey throughout Americas heartland. Throughout the story they meet interesting, flawed and evil characters but eventually find happiness through creating a new family. 1 likeLike CommentRainbowgardener452 reviews5 followersNovember 23, 2021If I had rated this half way through, I would have given it four stars. It was an engaging novel of the Depression and the Dust Bowl days. A little stereotypical--a pair of plucky kids end up orphaned and then adopted by a grizzled hobo and they all save each other-- but still enjoyable and with a lot of good background about what the times were like, all the Okies were flooding into California and no jobs to be had.About the time the story gets up to the New Deal, it fades out. There's five pages basically listing all the New Deal alphabet soup of agencies and what they did. It is thinly disguised as a conversation among several people, but when did people ever just sit around and name government agencies to each other? Then the war starts and much of the rest of the book is a blow by blow brief history of WWII, what was happening on the different fronts. The US gets into the war and basically all the male characters join up, except of course for our villain (boo! hiss!). The villain gets more and more like the cardboard villain character in the old melodramas ("You must pay the rent!" "I can't pay the rent!". ..."Curses, foiled again."). The plucky kids and the adopted mom they acquired along the way carry on and save the day. There's an extremely sappy and predictable romance and The End comes on screen in a burst of pink clouds. So three stars is an average of four stars for the first half and two for the second. Not really recommended; there's better novels covering the same periods. The author would have done better just to make this a novel of Depression and Dust Bowl days and flesh it out better and just end with a glimpse of better days to come. Trying to cover so much ground didn't work real well.fiction historical-novels1 commentLike CommentRebecca Wilfinger16 reviewsOctober 28, 2019The Longest Road by Jeanne Williams is a wonderful book! It will stay in my heart like an old friend forever. I grew up with stories of the Great Depression. In the plains states, the Dust Bowl marked my grandparents & my parents generations forever. This book introduces the reader to one family’s tragedies & triumphs in facing the worst times a family could face. It makes very personal & real the Dust Bowl, Depression, & the exodus of an entire generation to seek jobs & survival over the next rise. The history is absolutely accurate, moving all the way through the WWII years of fear & loss. I loved this book. I laughed, I cried, & I rejoiced that I had read this wonderful tale. And if you read the audio version, Patty Duke (yes, *that* Patty Duke) is absolutely fabulous at bringing all the characters to vivid life, helping greatly to cement them in your heart!Like CommentJakky312 reviews4 followersJune 17, 2020This started off as one of the best books I’ve read in a really, really long time. The writing was captivating and the characters rang true to me. The story itself took a lot of unexpected turns and I enjoyed following wherever those turns led. However... eventually, it’s as though the author ran out of gas... or perhaps the editor did? The relationships between characters were believable enough, albeit a little (a lot) contrived. But I wanted to believe in them, so I continued on the journey. I admit it; I’m a sucker for a happy ending... but towards the end, the story went from thoughtful, meaningful commentary on the times to predictable, sentimental, anticlimactic finale.1 commentLike CommentAndrea Sexton5 reviewsJuly 7, 2021The Longest Road is a clear-eyed, painful look at America's 1930s dust bowl days. You may find yourself singing along as Laurie rides the rails, learning songs by Woody Guthrie and others. This novel is well-researched and one of Jeanne Williams' major strengths is her judicious use of it -- never too much, never too little. Did you know, for example, that starting in 1919, there was such a thing as the Hobo College in Chicago? This coming of age novel is definitely worth the read, and it contains one of the best comeuppances of any villain -- a death scene you want to revisit over and over again.Like CommentJennifer183 reviews5 followersFebruary 17, 2021It started off slow with a bit too much religious fodder. I enjoyed how the religious bits toned down as the main character developed into her own voice. If you're into depression era novels of human triumph, this novel delivers. Everything ended happily ever after which seems unlikely in real life, but I am glad the characters were able to find joy. Most of us today would not have survived the depression by long shot.Like CommentRon Matsu57 reviewsJuly 5, 2021Everything you could ask for in a novel!I was amazed at the historical content in every chapter. The author wove historical events smoothly into the flow of the novel. There is so much enlightenment about the dust bowl conditions for the land and inhabitants. The power of religion in those times was also well developed through the thoughts, actions and talk of Laurie. The kind-hearted attitude of people who had do little but shared what they had was inspiring.Like CommentCarol Beach10 reviewsJune 19, 2019A Great ReadI really enjoyed this book. It had lots of historical data and the story kept me wanting to read more. I almost rated it five stars but some of the things that happened were quite implausible even though they were necessary to keep the narrative moving forward. Will read more from this author. Like CommentJeanetta Cooper56 reviewsJuly 16, 2019Reflections on lifeStories like this that come right out of life make me realize that no matter what struggles one may think they face, they can't be as tough as those faced during the dust bowl and Great Depression. Being an Oklahoman i recognized many of the landmarks, towns, and takes of early oilfield life. A good, clean, captivating readLike CommentBecky Roper632 reviewsJuly 22, 2019I felt like this book should have been titled "The Longest Book". It was a saga of two young children left orphaned during the dustbowl years and continues with their story into WWII years. There were several improbable events and I grew weary of the narrative tone.

                                                    Serena Williams is one of the most heralded female athletes in the world. She's currently the number one women's tennis player and has won more prize money than any other female athlete in history. Even with all the joy and success tennis brings her, Serena recently decided to start pursuing one of her other passions. It has nothing to do with sports or fame...Serena is currently enrolled in classes to become a certified nail technician."When I was younger, I was always obsessed with nails," Serena says. "It kind of relaxes me." When Serena first came up with the idea, she says people thought it was a joke. "No one believed me, and I'm like, 'Listen—I'm going to nail school.'" She's now enrolled in classes, but she's been keeping her identity a secret. "Everybody's always like, 'You look like Serena Williams,' and I'm like, 'If I hear that one more time...'" she jokes.

Photograph: Jacopo Raule/Getty ImagesWomen‘We must continue to dream big’: an open letter from Serena WilliamsWriting for Porter Magazine’s Incredible Women of 2016 issue, the tennis star takes aim at the barriers that still hold women athletes back
 How feminists embraced the radical open letterSerena WilliamsTue 29 Nov 2016 02.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 24 Nov 2017 23.01 ESTTo all incredible women who strive for excellence,When I was growing up, I had a dream. I’m sure you did, too. My dream wasn’t like that of an average kid, my dream was to be the best tennis player in the world. Not the best “female” tennis player in the world.I was fortunate to have a family that supported my dream and encouraged me to follow it. I learned not to be afraid. I learned how important it is to fight for a dream and, most importantly, to dream big. My fight began when I was three and I haven’t taken a break since.But as we know, too often women are not supported enough or are discouraged from choosing their path. I hope together we can change that. For me, it was a question of resilience. What others marked as flaws or disadvantages about myself – my race, my gender – I embraced as fuel for my success. I never let anything or anyone define me or my potential. I controlled my future.So when the subject of equal pay comes up, it frustrates me because I know firsthand that I, like you, have done the same work and made the same sacrifices as our male counterparts. I would never want my daughter to be paid less than my son for the same work. Nor would you.As we know, women have to break down many barriers on the road to success. One of those barriers is the way we are constantly reminded we are not men, as if it is a flaw. People call me one of the “world’s greatest female athletes”. Do they say LeBron is one of the world’s best male athletes? Is Tiger? Federer? Why not? They are certainly not female. We should never let this go unchallenged. We should always be judged by our achievements, not by our gender.For everything I’ve achieved in my life, I am profoundly grateful to have experienced the highs and lows that come with success. It is my hope that my story, and yours, will inspire all young women out there to push for greatness and follow their dreams with steadfast resilience. We must continue to dream big, and in doing so, we empower the next generation of women to be just as bold in their pursuits.Serena Williams TopicsWomenSerena WilliamsUS sportsCelebrityMagazinesfeaturesReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedFootballCricketRugby unionTennisCyclingF1GolfBoxingRugby leagueRacingUS sportsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2023 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Actresses Demi Singleton and Saniyya Sidney with Venus and Serena Williams at the premiere of King Richard











Actresses Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton recently spoke to 'Elle UK' about their experience portraying Venus and Serena Williams in the film King Richard. The biopic on the Williams sisters' father, Richard Williams, was released on November 19.

When asked to explain how she reacted to meeting the Williams sisters on set, Saniyya Sidney revealed that she was "hysterically crying." Sidney said she was excited to present their story to the world and "couldn't wait" to begin playing the role of Venus Williams.







"I was hysterically crying," Saniyya Sidney said. "But I was so excited I just couldn't wait to tell their story. I was in love with the script and I couldn't wait to jump into my childhood hero's shoes. I was ready."
Echoing Sidney's comments, Demi Singleton said the Williams sisters are "strong black women" whom they idolize.
"I definitely felt the same way. As Saniyya mentioned Serena and Venus [Williams], they're both our childhood heroes and strong black women that we look up to," Demi Singleton said.
King Richard Film@KingRichardFilm“It feels so good to be alive.” Based on the true story of Venus and Serena Williams that will inspire the world, watch the new trailer for #KingRichard, starring Will Smith and featuring "Be Alive" by Beyoncé. See it in theaters and streaming exclusively on @HBOMax November 19.9:30 AM · Oct 21, 202159171932“It feels so good to be alive.” Based on the true story of Venus and Serena Williams that will inspire the world, watch the new trailer for #KingRichard, starring Will Smith and featuring "Be Alive" by Beyoncé. See it in theaters and streaming exclusively on @HBOMax November 19. https://t.co/DVmvegf4zF




When asked how they prepared for their roles, Singleton revealed that she and Saniyya Sidney did their own research prior to filming. She explained that it was easier for them to find old pictures and videos of Venus Williams than Serena, since the former rose to fame earlier than her younger sister.
"Before we started filming, we did our own research," Singleton continued. "We were looking on the internet for archival videos and photos of when they were little girls. For Serena Williams, specifically, there aren't a whole lot of them out there, not as many as Venus, because Venus kind of stepped into the spotlight a bit before Serena did so it was a little bit difficult for me."
"Learning how to play like two of the greatest athletes of all time was very difficult" - Demi Singleton on how she trained for the role of Serena Williams

Demi Singleton proceeded to shed light on her training regime for the film. She revealed that it comprised two to three hours of daily tennis practice on weekdays, before and after the COVID-19 outbreak.
She admitted that although it was difficult to learn the unique playing styles of Venus and Serena Williams, she and Saniyya Sidney were up for the challenge.
"We did a lot of tennis training. For me it was two to three hours a day, Monday through Friday. It was a month and a half before and after COVID. And learning how to play like two of the greatest athletes of all time is very difficult. But I think we were both up for the challenge because of what the story is," said the 14-year-old.

Why Serena Williams’ Heroes in Life ‘Changed’ After Motherhoodby Greg Brian

Being a tennis superstar and a mom at the same time is more than a Herculean task, even if that metaphor has a male connotation. For a woman, it’s not usually recognized enough when dealing with a busy career and having children. 
It had to take Serena Williams to broach the subject and make it clear how big of a job this is. When interviewed recently by Anna Wintour during New York Fashion Week, Williams gave a shoutout to women who’ve had kids. Being a mother herself now, she notes the heroes she once worshiped changed from the typical.
Who does she look up to now? For those who support the direction of women in the world and realize how much they’ve gone through, Williams’ comments were more than a little refreshing.
Serena Williams’ heroes are no longer sports icons

No doubt most of Williams’ heroes before becoming a mother were women who happened to be tennis greats. How could she not be influenced by tennis legends like Ora Washington, Althea Gibson, or Zina Garrison? These African-American women changed the game of tennis forever by breaking near impossible racial barriers.
Once Williams became a mother in 2017, her opinions shifted on who were the real heroes of the world. She told Wintour above that mothers, in general, became her personal heroes. This is mostly because they still go unsung on how much they have to deal with to keep going.
There was a clear distinction made between working mothers and those who can afford to take time off. Williams noted the disparity, hence her heroes being the women who don’t have the luxury to take maternity leave from their jobs. Those who have to go back to a 9 to 5 job after having a child face the most grueling schedule anyone can have. 
Recognizing mothers who have to leave their children to maintain a career

Serena Williams has found a new fan base in working mothers everywhere. Our ed-at-large @jamilarizvi sums it up with a poignant love letter. (Paywall.)https://t.co/n8FYYWC1LW— futurewomen (@FutureWomen) August 3, 2018

One thing Williams noted about all working mothers is most have to leave their children during the day (or sometimes longer) to keep their jobs going. Anyone who’s grown up at daycare centers or with a nanny knows what it’s like to have to be away from their moms for a full day, if not longer.
Some mothers haven’t had a chance to spend any quality time with their kids until they retire. That seems cruelly unfair when thought about a little deeper.
No doubt many fans of Williams find it eye-opening to see her understand what it’s like for middle-class families in a time when wealth in sports divides from reality. Regardless, she does understand what it’s like to have to be away from her own daughter.
Will working moms finally be recognized more in a time when it’s challenging for working moms to enjoy paid maternity leave in every state?
Serena Williams could become an advocate for more laws in helping working moms

In many countries paid maternity leave is required by law: Switzerland (8 weeks); Mexico (12 weeks); France (19  weeks); South Korea (25 weeks); Sweden 35 weeks); Estonia (85 weeks ). Not in US where the number is 0 (zero). "Great" economy? Family values?https://t.co/VYWfIhKpVc— Richard D. Wolff (@profwolff) February 10, 2020

Thus far, the federal Family and Medical Leave Act only provide 12 weeks of time off without pay to the mother. Many have tried to stand up for a more fair bill in providing a paid maternity leave scenario for America’s moms.
Only four states in the U.S. offer paid maternity leave, with New York recently joining the fray. Let’s hope Serena Williams will fight for more measures like this after opening up about her support of working mothers.
Considering even her sister, Venus, is in awe of Serena and in how she’s working as a mom, it’s clear the latter has become her own hero. From all indications, she intends to make sure more women in similar situations are recognized more often after joining The Mom Project.

Serena Williams

by Kimiya Tabrizi
from San Diego, California in United States


“True heroism is remarkably sober, very undramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever cost”(Ashe). Arthur Ashe, a legendary tennis player, believed that heroes have an urge to serve, not to surpass. Heroes are those who strive to help others, yet continue to manage their own happiness and health.  A hero can be defined as a person who donates any amount of money to charity, a teen who walks an elder’s dog free of charge, or anybody who helps out in their community. David Granger speaks about how heroes always come through to inspire society: “Heroes arrive when we need them most. They define us and point us in a direction. To turn our sights at this moment toward an idea of America that is heroic does, admittedly, require an act of will”(Granger). What singles a hero out from any other average being is how many barriers he/she is willing to break in order to aid those in need.  Furthermore, in order to maintain positivity and give back to society, a hero must be generous, determined, and strong--both mentally and physically. These traits benefit not only the hero himself but also those that he/she helps. Generosity and strength are the two main traits a hero must possess in order to succeed.
Serena Williams in 1992Ken LevineOf all the people who possess these traits, famous tennis player Serena Jameka Williams surpasses the ideals of a hero. Williams has broken many records and won many tournaments that have shaped her career.  So far, she has taken home 72 wins on the WTA tour, she has earned $84,463,131 in career prize money, and she has nearly doubled that amount earned in endorsements and appearance fees. That is how many wins and how much hard work it takes to become, and to hold the ranking for #1 women’s tennis player in the world. On her sixth occasion, Williams held the number one spot for 186 consecutive weeks. Throughout her career, her name has been at first place for a total of 319 weeks.  Born on September 26, 1981, Serena Williams was introduced to the sport of tennis at a very young age, along with her four older sisters. She was only three years old when her parents decided to put them on the court. Their parents, Richard Williams and Oracene Price, taught themselves how to play the sport because they knew that tennis was their ticket out of the slums of Compton, CA. Richard and Oracene had their thoughts straight because they were correct; by the time Williams reached age 9, the Williams family relocated to Florida to play better tennis. When Williams started getting more skilled, and once her name was known in the junior tennis circuit, her professional career took off just years later. Age 17. 1999. The year when Williams won her first Grand Slam singles title at the U.S. Open. It was a massive win for her. That win is what ignited her forever-burning flame of success.  Unfortunately, only four years later, Yetunde Price (Williams’ eldest sister) was shot and killed back in Compton. The bullet was meant to reach her boyfriend at the time, but sadly it hit Yetunde instead. It was a major devastation to the family, and also a setback on Williams’ career. It impacted Williams’ mindset, to the point where depression was something on her mind. Through her strength, even depression is something that she was able to battle and overcome. World-renowned tennis player, Serena Williams, utilized her strength and determination to defy society’s norms of a standard athlete, thus shaping her into the generous, iconic woman that she is today.
2008 U.S. Open win, showing off those muscles!Timothy A. ClarySerena Williams and her trophy from the Australian open, won while pregnantMartin RichardThrough physical and mental strength, Williams thrives both on and off the court, even in the toughest of times. During an interview, Bissinger questioned Williams about how she felt going into the Australian Open while carrying an eight-week-old fetus: “The Australian Open was about to begin, and an immediate medical determination had to be made on what risk there might be in playing. The doctor who examined her thought she was about three or four weeks pregnant—it was almost impossibly hard to tell because the fetus was so small—and said there was no risk whatsoever. When Williams returned to the States and had a subsequent exam, it was discovered that she had actually been more advanced, about seven to eight weeks, but she said she still would have played”(Bissinger).  Williams’ ability to play all seven matches in the tournament, and win them all in straight sets, all with the stresses and physical impact clearly shows how tenacious of a woman she really is. The fact that Williams said that she would have played even if she knew that she was seven to eight weeks pregnant shows that she is a risk-taker, which ultimately shows her mental strength. Williams’ obstacles, whether small or large, do not stop her use of her impeccable strength to push through, even in the most excruciatingly painful times. Her physical strength is not the only thing that carried her through, but her determined mentality plays an important role in her success. Tennis can be strenuous on the mind, but the right mindset can keep you going: During the same interview, Bissinger inquired about her mentality during the game: “Serena plays a sport that requires the mental focus of instantaneously letting go of losing points and moving on because there are a lot of excruciating ones no matter how great you are, continual regrouping and re-inventing: dwell on them, you lose confidence; lose confidence and you lose. She is also superbly conditioned, given that a female tennis player may run about three miles in a match without the luxury of coming out of the game because you feel winded or lost too much money gambling with teammates the night before on the charter and would rather mope on the bench” (Bissinger).  The phrase, “lose confidence and you lose” states that confidence is a key factor in a player’s mindset if they hope to emerge victorious. Williams’ immaculate “winner’s mentality” and her ability to correct her mistakes in a match is one of the essential reasons of why she is so prosperous in tennis. Her confidence and determination as a female tennis player results in her investing time and work into her game, especially after tournaments. There is no room for her to skip practicing, especially during tournament season, because of her extreme focus on her game plan. Williams’ powerful strength carried her to become an incredibly generous woman.
Venus and Serena Williams at YPRC launchunknownBy donating thousands and thousands of dollars to many different charities that support different causes, Williams satisfied her need of giving back those who are less fortunate than herself. Williams shows hospitality when she provides resources to the unprivileged: “I know first-hand the devastating effects violence has on loved ones…the pain and grief often feels unbearable. This is why I launched the Yetunde Price Resource Center (YPRC), to provide comprehensive resource, referral and case management services to individuals and families affected by community violence. I want to help others gain access to the tools they need to cope, heal and move forward in life”  (Serena Williams). Once the financial resources were available, she founded the YPRC to provide a resource for society, one that she did not have when Yetunde was killed. Compton, CA is not the safest place for a family to be living, so she knows how difficult it is for families in her neighborhood to cope with the passing of a loved family member. One of Williams’ many funds, the YPRC, protects and provides for families involved with community violence. The Williams family not only helps their hometown of Compton but also contributes worldwide: “Through UNICEF, we got involved in a program that distributed bed nets to help cut down on the spread of malaria” (Williams 181).  Williams, her mother, and sister Isha, all took a trip to different countries in Africa. There, they contributed to the poor areas by building schools for children that are free to attend. They also hosted clinics to teach tennis to the children. Since 2011, Williams is an ambassador for UNICEF, and through them, she helped a poor area in Africa get access to vaccines for malaria to contribute to slowing down the spread of the disease. The amount of money that she has put into these charities and has given to those in need is legendary; what is incredible is the heart that she has in order to do these kind things for society.
QuoteNikeThrough utilizing her immense strength and determination, world-renowned tennis player, Serena Williams defied society’s norms of a standard athlete, which shaped her into the generous, iconic woman that she is today.  Williams’ incredible mental power provides her with a way to break through the toughest emotional times. Her physical strength allows her to play tennis, even with the biggest obstacles--like pregnancy. She has also donated thousands and thousands of dollars to many different charities, and has started multiple funds to help those in need. Serena Williams is an inspirational figure, who is shaped by her struggles of successfully emerging out of her hometown. Through all the bumps in the road, she always ends with a positive mindset and her head up high: “I’ve never been the right kind of woman. Oversized, and overconfident. Too mean if I don’t smile. Too black for my tennis whites. Too motivated for motherhood. But I’m proving. Time and time again. There’s no wrong way to be a woman”(Instagram) shows the boundaries she has pushed, and all of society’s rules that she has broken. Even today, she is still breaking limits as a famous black female tennis player from Compton, California.  Personally, Serena Williams inspires me primarily through her strength. Through the undesirable moments of mental distress, I tend to reflect on how Williams defeated many of her own emotional battles. The struggles associated with my shoulder injury allow me to relate to her physical power as well. Furthermore, what makes me feel like I can conquer any conflict, on and off the court, is how she managed to end the Australian Open with an iconic win. Her impressive positivity always succeeds to uplift my spirit. Williams has never been the type of woman to flaunt her success upon others; she is humble about her wins and accepting of her losses--which is something to be proud of. Just as Arthur Ashe stated, heroes are defined by their urge to serve, not to surpass. By her humble and generous qualities of helping out not only her hometown, but also many nations of Africa, Serena Williams fits the definition of a true heroic woman.

Most-named childhood hero in ESPN The Magazine's not-so-scientific survey of professional athletes. Steve Freeman/NBAE/Getty ImagesFacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmailJun 20, 2019StaffFacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerPinterestEmailprintEveryone's got a favorite athlete growing up -- the one whose jerseys we buy, whose highlights we replay over and over, who we imagine ourselves being while we practice on the court or in the backyard. And, it turns out, those athletes who are idols in their own right at this very moment had their own guiding stars when they were growing up. So we asked more than 100 of today's biggest pro athletes who they looked up to when they were youngsters."I loved that Lisa Leslie was really tall and skinny like me. I played basketball as a kid, and I loved how she carried herself. She had this great feminine quality, but she was also so fierce as an athlete and very competitive, and I loved that about her. So thank you, Lisa Leslie, for being so awesome."--Monica Abbott (Team USA softball pitcher)Lisa Leslie (Eight-time WNBA All-Star)Davante Adams (Green Bay Packers wide receiver)Michael Vick (Four-time Pro Bowl quarterback)"My foster mom was a personal trainer at Sitiveni Sivivatu's gym. For my birthday she got his rugby shorts for me, which was nice. And he signed them. So I figured these were new. I, like, put 'em to my face, bro. And she was like, 'Bro, those are dirty,' and I was like, 'Oh, is that what that is? It f---ing smells, man.' It was pretty bad."--Steven Adams (Oklahoma City Thunder center)Sitiveni Sivivatu (New Zealand rugby winger)LaMarcus Aldridge (San Antonio Spurs forward/center)Michael Jordan (Six-time NBA champion)Josh Allen (Buffalo Bills quarterback)Brett Favre (Three-time MVP quarterback)Efra Alvarez (LA Galaxy midfielder)Lionel Messi (FC Barcelona forward)Henry Anderson (New York Jets defensive end)Andruw Jones (Atlanta Braves outfielder)Bianca Andreescu (Canadian tennis player)Kim Clijsters (Two-time Grand Slam winner)"The Greatest" was, no surprise, one of the most popular answers among athletes naming their childhood sports heroes. Bettman/Getty ImagesBen Askren (UFC welterweight)Muhammad Ali (Heavyweight boxing champion)Zaila Avant-garde (Spelling bee/viral basketballdribbling prodigy)Steph Curry (Golden State Warriors guard)Conrad Bassett-Bouchard (U.S. Scrabble champion)Ichiro Suzuki (Baseball world hits leader)Kiki Bertens (Dutch tennis player)Kim Clijsters (Belgian tennis player)Eric Bledsoe (Milwaukee Bucks guard)Allen Iverson (NBA Hall of Famer)"When I was 8, I sent out 150 cards to athletes to try to get autographs.

(Follow @alyroe on Twitter).Follow on TwitterFacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerPinterestEmailprintThis story was originally published on Sept. 8, 2016. Serena Williams has made history. With a win over her older sister Venus in the final of the Australian Open on Jan. 28, Williams holds more Grand Slam titles than any player in the Open era. To win a title, a player must win seven matches over two weeks on the sport's greatest stages and against its most dominant players. Williams, 35, has done so 23 times in 66 Grand Slam appearances and has surpassed Steffi Graf's Open era record of 22. Now that she has reached 23, the buzz turns to Margaret Court's all-era record of 24, and history beckons again.Such has been the career of Serena Williams, built of milestones upon milestones, as she became the first, the fastest, the winningest. For more than two decades, she has captivated our attention and confounded our ability to easily package her enigmatic personality. She is complicated and contradictory, fierce and shy, intense yet vulnerable. Those who know her best say it's this internal turbulence that has driven her to rise from moments of despair and continue to chase excellence in a sport she has come to define, while pursuing happiness in a life that regularly tests her ability to overcome.As she continues her historic 2017 season, we offer an oral history, through more than 20 interviews with her friends, family, competitors and coaches, of the lessons, experiences, hardships and successes that have crafted Williams into the greatest competitor the sport of tennis has ever seen.PART ONE: THE PRODIGYPART TWO: THE BEGINNING OF THE WINNINGPART THREE: THE HARD YEARSPART FOUR: THE BREAKPART FIVE: THE ROAD TO 23Louisa BertmanPART ONE: THE PRODIGYSEPT. 26, 1981Serena Jameka Williams is born in Saginaw, Michigan, to Richard Williams and Oracene Price. It's a Saturday.Oracene Price (mother): "What I remember about the day Serena was born is that she was a 10 ½-pound baby. But she wasn't a hard delivery, my youngest daughter."Isha Price (sister): "We didn't know if Serena was going to be a boy or a girl. My sisters and I were at our grandmother's house. We weren't allowed to go to the hospital, and I remember wishing and hoping we had a little brother. I remember the phone call and our grandmother calling us into one room and saying 'You have another baby sister.' I was a little disappointed."The youngest of five girls, Serena embraces the role of little sis. Growing up, she shares a bedroom and two sets of bunk beds with her siblings -- Lyndrea and Venus on the two lower bunks, and Isha and Yetunde on the upper bunks. Each night, Serena crawls into bed with a different sister. When it comes to her older sisters, Serena always gets her way. Isha: "We would have these family talent shows, and Serena always had to win. She always sang the same song, 'Greatest Love of All' by Whitney Houston. Even if she sounded like screeching tires, she won. That's what we had to do or she would throw a tantrum and cry. We didn't want to deal with the repercussions of her not winning."Oracene: "With Serena, everything had to be perfect and she would get frustrated if it wasn't. She always had to win, no matter if it was a talent show, cards, she had to be the winner. She would sit on cards. And they let her do it. They gave it to her, even if she didn't win. I think it affects her to this day, because she hates losing. That's how come it was so inappropriate when they said we were setting matches. Serena is not going to lose for no one."In 1983, the family moves to Compton, California. After learning that top female tennis players can earn thousands of dollars per tournament, Richard and Oracene begin teaching themselves the game in order to coach their daughters. When Serena is 3 and Venus is 4, they pick up their first rackets, and their parents set to work. Richard eventually leaves his job to coach the girls full time. Serena is a quick study. In 1991, she plays her first junior tournament at the age of 9 and makes it to the final, where she faces Venus.Serena Williams in 1992. Ken Levine/Getty ImagesIsha: "Venus was older and playing tournaments, and Serena wasn't playing tournaments yet. Venus was enrolled in this particular tournament, and Serena wasn't. Unbeknownst to my dad and mom, Serena sent in the application and signed herself up for the tournament. Who does that? You had to pay to sign up, and the tournament directors had to get the money from my parents. She always wanted to be just like Venus; it was that little sister hero-worship thing. Even then, she wanted to compete."Venus Williams (older sister): "She got tired of watching me play. She wanted to play. Back then, I was bigger and stronger, and in the changeovers during the final, she'd say, 'Venus, let me win a game.' I ignored her. We were supposed to be professional. I ended up winning the tournament, and afterward I said, 'Serena, I think we should switch trophies. I like the silver one better anyway.' She was the little sister, so she had no problem taking my trophy. We still have them in our home in Florida."1991Unlike most young players, Serena and Venus play few junior tournaments. Richard chooses instead to hold his daughters out of competition until they are ready to compete on the pro tour. In 1991, they meet with their first high-profile professional coach, Rick Macci, in Compton. A few months later, the family moves to Florida so that Serena and Venus can train with him at Grenelefe Golf & Tennis Resort in Haines City.Rick Macci (Serena's coach from 1991 to 1995): "Normally if I see kids play, I see them at a national tournament. I'm not going to somebody's house. Richard said, 'The only thing I can guarantee you is you won't get shot.' I had to meet this guy. He's a comedian. I flew to Los Angeles on a Friday night. Richard, Oracene, Venus and Serena came to my hotel room in Compton, and we talked for three hours. I will never forget Venus and Serena: One was sitting on each of Richard's legs looking at me while he grilled me: What do you have for breakfast? Why aren't you married? How many girlfriends? Do you travel with kids? What is your religion? What time do you get up? Are you colorblind? Have you ever taught a black person? When that ended, he said, 'We'll pick you up at 7 a.m. and go to East Hills Country Club.'"They picked me up in a Volkswagen van. It was shaking back and forth, three months' worth of McDonald's wrappers, clothes, Coke cans, bottles and a spring coming out of the seat. We get to the courts, and it's not a country club. It's a crummy park. There are guys playing basketball, people passed out in the grass, broken glass all over the courts, people drinking beer. Every person we passed called him King Richard. We had to cross the basketball court to get to the tennis courts, and it parted like the Red Sea.Editor's PicksSerena, Naomi Osaka and the most controversial US Open final in history4yDon Van NattaGOAT debate over: Serena Williams and everyone else6yJohnette Howard20 stars serve up Serena praise8y2 Related"Usually after five minutes I can tell if there is something special. We're hitting balls, and I'm going, 'These girls aren't that good.' There were arms and hair and legs flying everywhere, beads flying out of their hair. They were improvising, hitting off their back feet. Then I said, 'Let's play some points.' I swear to God, their stock went soaring through the hemisphere. Their footwork got better, their prep got better, they cleaned up their act. What blew me away was their burning desire to run and fight and get to every ball like their hair was on fire. I had never seen two kids try so hard. I had never seen bodies that could move like that. Athletes with their body types went to other sports; they didn't play tennis."Lyndrea Price (sister): "Their journey was my journey because I had to wake up too. When Venus and Serena left, I left. It was a family effort. We didn't have a hopper, because those were expensive, so I would shuffle the balls with my racket and pick them up. I wasn't playing, but I was out there every day."Even as a kid, Serena was built. She was so muscular. She didn't have to do a lot of work to get that physique. It was an anomaly that she was gifted at 3 years old to have that body. I remember thinking, wait 'till they get a load of you."Freddy Bryant (East Compton Park employee): "We always had to have the courts cleaned and hosed down because Richard stayed on us. He would bring generators, tennis-serving machines, and the girls would work. Mom would sit in the van and read books. She was always reading. When they finished, the girls would come inside and play pingpong and eat the summer lunch we served to the community. One day stands out to me. Serena was out by herself, going from baseline to baseline and Richard was like, 'You wanna quit? You wanna quit? Go sit in the van with your mom.' Serena said, 'No. No.' She didn't give up, and every time she hit the ball, I heard that grunt. She was 10 years old. She was grunting and fighting. I was like, 'Wow. This little girl right here, she's a tiger.'"Nick Bollettieri  (legendary tennis coach, head of the IMG Academy): "I remember Richard Williams coming to my house in Longboat Key with his two daughters and saying they would be bigger than Michael Jordan. They all thought Richard was crazy. But he did something no one else did. He kept them back from tournaments and taught them technique and to go for it. Their daddy said, 'Run for every ball.' And Serena would say, 'Daddy, the ball is out.' And he'd say, 'No ball is out. You have two sets of eyes: your eyes and your brain. By the time your brain registers what your eyes think they see, it's too late. But when you move, you get the ball.'"Macci : "One day, Venus was out there grinding. Serena wasn't working hard or moving her feet. I said, 'Jameka [Serena's middle name], you have to start moving.' 'What are you going to give me?' she asked. 'I'm tired. I'm thirsty. If you get me a Pepsi and some curly fries and a Snickers bar ... and on the corner, they're selling Green Day T-shirts. If you get me that, I will work 100 percent for the next hour.' This was her maturity. I had an assistant get it all but the shirt, and this girl moved her feet on the court like Spider-Man. For one hour, this girl was on fire. When that hour was up, she said, 'I'm done and I expect that Green Day shirt here at 8 a.m.'"OCT. 28, 1995At age 13, Serena makes her pro debut in the qualifying draw at the Bell Challenge in Quebec, where she loses in less than an hour. She doesn't play a tournament in 1996. At the 1997 Ameritech Cup, she upsets No. 7 Mary Pierce and No. 4 Monica Seles, becoming the lowest-ranked player (No. 304) in the Open era to defeat two top-10 opponents in one tournament. She loses in the semifinal match.Bollettieri : "From the years I traveled with the Williams family and they came to my camps, the story I most remember is Serena sitting in the shade in my stadium court, head down, so upset. She said, 'Nick, I'm tired of coming in second place.'"PART TWO: THE BEGINNING OF THE WINNINGSerena Williams and Max Mirnyi after winning Wimbledon mixed doubles in 1998. AP Photo/Dave CaulkinJULY 1998Serena and partner Max Mirnyi win mixed doubles at Wimbledon and again two months later at the US Open.Macci : "In practice, all Serena did was play guys. She beat guys three to four years older than her. It didn't matter who was on the other side of the net. She didn't look at it like this girl is ranked this or that guy is 16. At 11, she told me she thought she was better than John McEnroe. She said, 'Did you ever see his strokes? He has terrible strokes. I can beat him for sure.' It was silly, but she meant it from the heart. And she believed it. A great competitor is borderline cocky and courageous."JULY 25, 1999Serena, ranked No. 11 in the world, and Venus, No. 4, make their Fed Cup debut. Serena is a last-minute replacement by coach Billie Jean King when Seles pulls out with tendinitis in her right arm. The Williams sisters account for all four wins in the U.S. team's 4-1 victory over Italy, sending them to the final. Mary Jo Fernandez (former professional tennis player, broadcaster, member of 1999 Fed Cup team): "She was young, a teenager, and that was my first glimpse of her inner strength and confidence. She was for sure the leader. And her sense of humor -- she's funny. She makes fun of herself. She carried this purse everywhere she went. If someone's pantyhose ripped, she pulled out a pair of pantyhose. It became a running joke during the tournament that whatever you needed, Serena had it in that bag."SEPT. 11, 1999At only 17, Serena wins her first Grand Slam title at the US Open, becoming the first African-American woman to win a major in the Open era. She jumps to No. 4 in the world rankings. It's a Saturday.Venus: "I was the older sister, and everyone thought I would win the first major, but she did. I felt motivated. Now I know what to do. Serena showed me what to do. That was crucial in my success in winning big events. It was a turning point in my career. At the time, I didn't think to say that to her, but over time, I've told her, 'If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have done anything.' We have a good laugh about that."SEPT. 20, 1999Serena's win in Flushing Meadows lands her on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Hollywood comes calling. In December, she guest-stars on "Hollywood Squares," and then, along with Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras and Venus, Serena records an episode of "The Simpsons" titled "Tennis the Menace."Bonnie Pietila (longtime producer and casting director for "The Simpsons"): "Venus and Serena recorded together, and they came to the Fox lot in a big SUV. Serena brought her dog. She was so good. She has voice control. And she can act. There have only been two people who have come in and I've been blown away at how good they were, because they aren't actors: Serena and Peter Frampton. When a nonactor comes in and can be that good, it's a wonderful surprise."After Serena and Venus finished recording the episode, it came time for them to sign covers of copies of the script. They each sat down in front of a pile of covers, and the two of them raced each other to see who could sign the fastest. Serena won."MARCH 15, 2001Venus, ranked No. 3, withdraws from her semifinal match at Indian Wells against Serena, No. 10, citing pain from tendinitis in her knee. Serena automatically advances to the final against Kim Clijsters. As Venus and her dad walk to their seats before the match, Richard says they are attacked with racial slurs. When Serena beats Clijsters, fans boo. The sisters vow never return to Indian Wells. Later that year, the sisters meet again, in the final of the US Open -- the first Williams vs. Williams Grand Slam title match. Serena loses 6-2, 6-4 to big sister Venus. Venus Williams lifting the US Open trophy after defeating her sister Serena in 2001. Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesPam Shriver (former top-five professional tennis player): "It was the first prime-time US Open final. There had been sensational buildup, and CBS was up against a huge college football game. Venus won and Serena was so angry about losing to her sister. She had a look that was totally different from the look Venus had when she lost. Venus always thought if she had to lose, it might as well be to a family member. But Serena hated it more because it was her sister."2003 After withdrawing from the 2002 Australian Open with an ankle sprain, Serena goes on a tear. She wins her first clay-court title at the Italian Open, the 2002 French Open, her first Wimbledon title and the US Open. She returns to the Australian Open a year later and wins, completing the Serena Slam by holding all four major titles simultaneously but not in the same calendar year. Incredibly, Serena faces Venus in all four finals matches. Shriver : "It is the most unlikely thing that has ever happened in our sport -- that siblings would face off against each other in the final of four straight majors; it is a once-in-a-galaxy type of thing. Nowadays you don't get the same rematch in one major final. That Serena won wasn't surprising. She is an all-around better tennis player than Venus. She has better technique, better grit and a more competitive, grinding spirit. Richard forecasted that a long time before there was ever a Serena Slam. It's hard to believe they grew up with the same coaching. They're so different. It's almost like Venus, being the older sister, was the guinea pig on certain shots, and they got the technique better with Serena."PART THREE: THE HARD YEARSSEPT. 14, 2003Serena's oldest sister and assistant, Yetunde Price, is killed in Compton, caught in gang crossfire while in the car with her boyfriend, a gang member. Serena is the first to learn of her sister's death and informs her mother and 'Tunde's children. Isha: "The thing I hated most about that situation was that Serena was the one who got the call. They had attempted to call us all, but it was late and my phone was off. We relied a lot on each other; it was us holding each other up at a really difficult time. Unless you've experienced that kind of loss, you can't fully describe to somebody else what that feels like, like part of yourself is gone. You have to almost re-learn how to live, how to approach every day."Shriver: "That news hit her very heavily. Her resilience throughout some major personal setbacks, her parents' divorce [in 2002], her sister's killing, her medical situations, she's had her share of heartbreak as far as relationships -- it's so impressive she's been able to stay on tennis track through such significant personal adversity."JULY 3, 2004No. 10 Serena loses to No. 15 Maria Sharapova in the Wimbledon final. Shriver: "Losing to Sharapova made Serena the champion she is today. Losing to her in straight sets was a stinging loss that catapulted Serena, in the big picture, to greater heights. That loss, followed by another to Sharapova at the year-end championships -- the last time Sharapova beat Serena --- was important for Serena. She didn't want to lose in major finals. Her record today in major finals is amazing, only six losses."Serena Williams falls to the ground during the 2004 Wimbledon final, in which she lost to Maria Sharapova. AP Photo/Anja Niedringhaus2005After winning her second Australian Open on Jan. 29, Serena spends much of 2005 and 2006 struggling with knee injuries, poor conditioning and depression stemming from her sister's death. She begins searching for life outside of tennis, guest-starring on TV shows and attending movie premieres. In the May 2006 issue of Tennis magazine, Chris Evert pens an open letter to Serena, imploring her to recommit to tennis. Two months later, Serena dips to No. 140 in the rankings. Chris Evert (former world No. 1 professional tennis player, tennis broadcaster): "I always thought she could be the greatest of all time. But when I wrote that letter, I didn't think she was taking it as seriously as she could. She was losing to players she should have been beating, she wasn't in good shape, she was going to movie premieres, she was distracted. I didn't want her to look back when she retired and think, 'All those years I squandered and I should have been in the best shape, I could have been more focused.' I didn't want her to have regrets. But what I didn't take into consideration was that she was going through a lot in her personal life too."Serena Williams in 2005. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images2007 Serena begins to rekindle her love of tennis and takes her first of several trips to Africa for charity appearances. She decides that if she is going to play, she is going to win. At the 2007 Australian Open, unseeded and ranked No. 81, she astounds the tennis world by beating Sharapova 6-1, 6-2 in the final. Oracene: "Going to Africa changed her life. She came back a totally different person. She fell in love with Africa. That helped her to refocus on her life and her career. Seeing where she came from, how we got to where we are now, seeing the ports where they shipped us off and the life of our people, that really changed her attitude about being a black woman."Newly determined, Serena begins working with renowned fitness trainer Mackie Shilstone. Serena and Venus win doubles at the 2008 Beijing Olympics under U.S. team coach Zina Garrison. A few weeks later, Serena wins her third US Open title. Mackie Shilstone (fitness trainer): "I worked with Peyton Manning before his final season. I've worked with thousands of professional athletes, some of the best in the world. I evaluate them all on their mental toughness, and Serena is one of the most mentally tough individual athletes I have ever seen, man or woman, in 30 years of experience."At the 2007 Australian Open, unseeded and ranked No. 81, Serena Williams astounds the tennis world by beating Maria Sharapova 6-1, 6-2 in the final. AP Photo/Rick StevensAPRIL 2009Serena launches a second clothing line (her first, Aneres, launched in 2003), this time with the Home Shopping Network, and appears on HSN for the first time. Mindy Grossman (CEO and director, Home Shopping Network; former global VP of apparel at Nike): "When she's on HSN, we take calls from viewers. The number and diversity of people who call in to talk to her is incredible. Normally if someone calls in, they have the product, are buying the product or want to talk about fashion. With Serena, they feel they have a connection with her; they're calling in to talk with someone they know. Everyone who appears on HSN gets a report card every visit. Each time, she wants to do better than the last time, and she wants to know who else is doing well."Isha: "She is completely invested in her fashion line. It's not just 'show up and smile for the cameras at HSN.' She has to understand what goes into making the clothes, why they chose that fashion. Her days, they're nightmarish in terms of what she has to do in order to execute her life."AUGUST 2009Coming off a win at Wimbledon and having won three of her past four majors, Serena makes it to the semifinal of the US Open, where she looks to defend her 2008 title. In the semifinal, Serena plays Clijsters, at the time an unseeded wild card who had last won the tournament in 2005, and loses the first set 6-4. She bashes her racket on the court, earning her a warning for racket abuse. In the second set, with Clijsters up 6-5 and Serena serving to send the set into a tiebreak, lineswoman Shino Tsurubuchi calls Serena for a foot fault on her second serve. Serena argues the call, threatens the lineswoman by saying, "I swear to God I'm [expletive] going to take this [expletive] ball and shove it down your [expletive] throat," and is assessed a point penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct, ending the match. Three months later, she is fined $82,500 and placed on a two-year probation. It's the largest fine ever levied against a professional tennis player.Shriver: "Most every player would say how unlikely it would be for you to be playing a two-and-a-half-hour match and for the only foot fault to be called that late in the match. That would have been Serena's initial anger. Why, at this crucial moment, is this my first foot fault of the night?"It was a hurtful moment for her on many levels. I don't think her intent was to lose it and say what she said. I just think in the heat of the moment, it's what happened. The publicity from that match and how she reacted was so difficult, so negative, that it didn't help her public popularity."In the last year and a half, especially, when Serena has had challenging moments, she has been much more gracious, given the opponent more credit. That doesn't mean she won't get mad and smack her racket and get upset. She still has her moments, but that's normal. But that was her worst moment."Isha: "I felt like she was being denied an opportunity to make a mistake. We've all said and done things we're not proud of because we're not perfect. But she didn't have the ability to be human. And nobody wants to feel like that, like I can't say anything, I can't do anything. If I'm not swinging a racket, people don't see me as a person. All they see is this sportsperson, and in this moment, as a woman and as a black woman, I'm not supposed to be able to express hurt when I know I'm being cheated. That's taking my voice, taking my humanity. So in that moment, I was most protective of her."Everybody was like, 'You've got to apologize to the world because of what you said.' That wasn't coming from [her family]. What we said was, 'Obviously it was a mistake; you absolutely owe the umpire an apology, but that's it. And that should be something private between you and her. Outside of that, whatever you feel you need to do to feel whole and be at peace about what happened, that's what you do. Because that's the only way you can stay true to yourself.'"What she learned is you have to keep yourself in check and handle your situations with dignity and grace. Sometimes you have to be the bigger person, even on the court, calm down and know that it's just a game and understand the space it should hold in your life. These are all parts of a bigger lesson."Shilstone: "Some of her outbursts on the court, they have been misconstrued. I was there when the woman called the foot fault. That woman missed completely. People don't think athletes are supposed to be human or have heart. There is no malice with Serena. It's the heat of the battle. Afterwards she apologized, but that is forgotten."Oracene: "It wasn't just that call. All the years and emotions popped out at once. Balls that were clearly in, that everyone in the stands could see were clearly in. That was her breaking point."Serena Williams arguing with the officials after her foot fault in the 2009 US Open. Julian Finney/Getty ImagesPART FOUR: THE BREAKJANUARY 2010 Serena beats rival Justine Henin in the Australian Open and wins doubles with Venus. But a nagging knee injury forces her to miss the next four months of tennis. To fill her time, Serena researches schools and enrolls in a 240-hour course at Palm Beach Nail Academy to become a certified nail technician. She says she plans to complete the course in one year while being the school's top student -- and its most fashionable. She practices her new craft by giving Oprah Winfrey a pedicure on air. Isha: "She's always been obsessed with her nails. And then it became, 'I could do this myself. I'm going to nail school.' She was completely fascinated. I didn't believe her. Then she got injured and couldn't play, and she enrolled herself in nail school. Then these opportunities started coming in. One day, she was like, 'If I do Oprah's nails, will it count for my hours?' Absolutely. Once she mastered it, it was almost like, 'OK, that's done. Finished and check and on to the next thing. What am I curious about now? How do I want to grow now?'"JULY 7, 2010 Four days after winning Wimbledon, Serena is walking out of a restaurant in Munich when she steps on broken glass, lacerating a tendon on the top of her right foot. This begins a bad run of health for Serena: In October, she reinjures the same tendon, forcing her to have season-ending surgery. Then, in January, a pulmonary embolism is detected in her lungs. Serena undergoes emergency treatment in March 2011 to remove a hematoma related to the embolism and is hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Serena says the scary experience is as mentally difficult as the death of her sister. She does not play again until June. Isha: "Seeing her in the hospital, in the bed, her eyes were closed, she was connected to tubes, and we didn't know the severity of the diagnosis, and I was terrified. This was our baby sister. When we found out everything, it became extremely real. We'd already suffered loss, and it was unfathomable to me that we would get hit like that twice, with the first [sister] and the last. It seemed like it wasn't even possible. We all prayed."Shilstone: "A couple of months later, we were training in West Palm Beach and she was fit, but she was grabbing her chair. She was wheezing. I realized she was still suffering from the pulmonary embolism. It was the battle of our lives. Before her next match, I told her, 'You've been introduced to death. You can't be worried about the woman on the other side of the net.'"JUNE 2011 Away from tennis for nearly a year, Serena returns to the court but struggles to find her game. She loses in the fourth round at Wimbledon and drops to No. 175, her lowest ranking since 1997. Then she loses in the final of the US Open in September. Around this time, the ever-curious Serena begins taking online classes at UMass University Without Walls. Her major is business management, which she later switches to pre-med. On the court, her losing streak continues into 2012: She gets knocked out in the fourth round of the Australian Open in January and in the first round of the French Open in May. It is her first loss in the opening round of a Grand Slam -- and the last straw. Having recently been introduced to French tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou by her friend and fellow pro Grigor Dimitrov, Serena reaches out to Mouratoglou. Patrick Mouratoglou (Serena's coach since 2012): "A few days after her [French Open] loss, she called and asked if she could come to the academy to practice. Most players leave town after they lose. She said, 'I want to practice because I want to win Wimbledon.' She wanted to get back to winning a Grand Slam and being No. 1. She hadn't won a Grand Slam for two years and was very disappointed. I said yes, and she asked for two hitting partners. She came and hit for 45 minutes. I was there but was not supposed to say anything to her. At the changeover, she sat down, turned to me and said, 'Speak to me.' So I spoke to her. Then she said, 'Can we start now?' And I said, 'Of course.'"2012With Mouratoglou, Serena works on her serve placement and tactics, as well as her confidence and conditioning. In April, in another unconventional move for a top player two decades into her career, Serena switches from natural gut to hybrid racket strings. Three months later, she wins Wimbledon for the fifth time. She follows that performance by winning two Olympic gold medals, in singles and doubles, at the London Games. Serena Williams at Wimbledon in 2012. Antoine Couvercelle/Panoramic/Icon SportswireMouratoglou: "She fought incredibly at Wimbledon. She is always a fighter but maybe more in that tournament than ever. She was coming to the matches with a plan. Of course, winning Wimbledon made a big difference in terms of her confidence. It's the same for every player ... the more you win, the more you win."Fernandez: "At the Olympics, she went through the draw without dropping games. I've never seen anything like it. We're used to how great she serves, but it wasn't only her serve. It was her returns, her groundstrokes, her volleys. She beat players like [Victoria] Azarenka and Sharapova without losing games. It was remarkable. It's the best I've seen her play."SEPTEMBER 2013 Serena, 31 and the oldest female tennis player to be ranked No. 1, wins her fifth US Open. The next day, Serena attends the men's final at Arthur Ashe Stadium with Nike CEO Mark Parker. Serena, a longtime Nike spokeswoman, jokes that she will one day succeed Parker as president of the company. Mark Parker (president and CEO of Nike): "I joined Serena to watch the men's US Open final between [Rafael] Nadal and [Novak] Djokovic. I asked her what she thought of the match, and she told me she had been taking mental notes on how to improve her own game -- the day after winning the Open. During the [2015 Australian] Open, I texted her and asked what she was doing between matches. I found out she was taking pre-med courses."Isha: "She loves holistic medicine. It's a real part of her study and what she wants to do. She's actually really good at it. We have this family event we do, and Serena wrapped me. She knows the muscles and the bones. It's almost irritating. It's like, how much can you learn? She wanted to speak French, so she's fluent in French. Whatever she sets her mind to do, she goes after it with so much enthusiasm and commitment until she gets it done. There are so few people in the universe who do that."PART FIVE: THE ROAD TO 23JAN. 31, 2015Serena meets Sharapova in the Australian Open final for the second time and wins 6-3, 7-6. It is her 16th straight victory over Sharapova. Serena becomes the oldest winner of the Australian Open at 33 years old. It's a Saturday.Serena Williams is overcome with emotion as she arrives on court at Indian Wells after a 13-year boycott. Julian Finney/Getty ImagesMouratoglou: "At the start of the year, she wanted to win. She was hungry. Journalists ask me always, what are my goals for the start of the year? The goal is to win the four Grand Slams. When I work with someone like Serena, what else can you have?"MARCH 13, 2015 Serena returns to Indian Wells after a 13-year boycott of the tournament. A knee injury forces her to withdraw in the semifinals.Isha: "She talked to my mom and dad and then came to me and said, 'I'm thinking about going back to Indian Wells.' I said, 'Really? Are you ready for that?' It took her to come to a place where she was understanding of who she was and how far she had come, so that Indian Wells didn't matter. You have to get to a place in yourself where, win, lose or draw, I'm doing this for me. I'm not doing it for anybody else. I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do for me at this point in my life. And to watch that process and see the reception she got, it was overwhelming."All the years when people were asking, 'Are you coming back?' Saying, 'Come back, please come back.' Now it was not anybody asking her -- but her making the decision. I was extremely proud because I don't know if I could have done it. She taught us all in that moment."Garrison (former professional tennis player, second African-American woman to make a Grand Slam final, at Wimbledon, 1990): "I think she's learned a lot about forgiveness over the years. What she did last year at [Indian Wells] blew my mind, made me cry. The fact that she's been big enough to humble herself in that way and show forgiveness was a strong statement for the times we live in right now, when young people need to see a leader like that. She said it felt right to her. Forgiveness was a big part of it, and not wanting to dwell on it anymore. That kind of energy brings you down, when you're holding on to old anger. The fact that she got to forgiveness, that can only be done by looking into yourself, deciding to be the best person you can be and making changes within yourself."MAY 2015After reading Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's bestseller "Lean In," Serena strikes up a friendship with Sandberg and her husband, Dave, in early 2015. When Dave dies of a heart attack in May, Serena reaches out to comfort her friend.Lyndrea: "Serena is the type of person who will call you to make sure you're OK. She'll call every 10 minutes if she thinks something is wrong. She'll sense this. Sheryl Sandberg lost her husband, and she did this for Sheryl for, like, months on end, every day. In order to help someone else, you have to have been through it. You go through things so you can uplift someone else. And that's what Serena did. I'm most proud of her in those moments. It's not about money, press, fame. It's about human connection."JUNE 4, 2015Serena reaches the semifinal of the French Open. Sick with the flu and down 4-6, 2-3 to No. 23 Timea Bacsinszky, Serena digs deep, wins the next game and doesn't drop another game in the match. She goes on to win the tournament, beating Lucie Safarova in three sets in the final, her 20th Grand Slam victory.Serena Williams was sick with the flu during the 2015 French Open. DOMINIQUE FAGET/AFP/Getty ImagesMouratoglou: "I don't think I've seen a player play being so sick. She would stay the whole day on the sofa and try to go out for a walk for 10 minutes and come back after two minutes. Not being able to sleep and having so much fever throughout most of the tournament, from the second round to the semis, then to play at the highest level, in the sun, and win against the best players in the world was impressive."JULY 11, 2015 Serena beats Garbine Muguruza 6-4, 6-4 to win Wimbledon for the sixth time and, at 33 years, 289 days, becomes the oldest player to win a Grand Slam singles title. With the win, she earns her second Serena Slam by holding all four major titles at once. She is one win from tying Graf's record of 22 Grand Slam wins and becoming the first woman since Graf in 1988 to complete the calendar-year Grand Slam. Mouratoglou: "Before winning Wimbledon, she had won two Grand Slams, but it's only two. For her, it's not incredible. But when she won the third, you start to think, 'Now we are getting close to something big.'"Serena Williams after winning the 2015 Australian Open. Rex Features/AP PhotoSerena Williams holds her French Open trophy and gathers with the tournament's ball boys and ball girls. Jon Buckle/Empics SportSerena Williams serves during the 2015 Wimbledon final, which she goes on to win. Julian Finney/Getty ImagesAUG. 15, 2015 At the Rogers Cup in Toronto, the warm-up to the US Open, Serena loses to Swiss teen Belinda Bencic in the semifinals.Mouratoglou: "She comes to me the morning after and says, 'We have to go practice; I'm tired of losing.' We were in August. She'd lost three matches ... in a year."Shilstone: "We do a thing called the Mackie Short Shuttle. It's a series of sprints with recovery time between them, and the sprints and the rest get progressively shorter as the workout goes on, but they go up in number. When we first started, Serena was falling out at different times. Last year before the US Open, she did all 72 sprints for the first time. After the tournament, she said, 'Those doggone sprints, they saved me. I can go forever.'"SEPT. 8, 2015Serena advances to the US Open quarterfinals, where she beats sister Venus. Then, in one of the most shocking upsets in tennis history, Serena loses to unseeded Roberta Vinci in the semifinals. Mouratoglou: "On this morning, I saw that she was in a bad day. She had a lot of pain in her knees and the stress went higher. There was clearly big pressure from the outside. The US Open advertising was about her only. Vinci played the match of her life, and Serena made more mistakes than usual and would not go 100 percent on her shots. She couldn't hit as many winners as usual. The good thing, and it's what I've told her, whether you do this or not, it is not going to change who you are in your career. You've won 21 Grand Slams. You are going to win others. You are going to beat the record of all time."Roberta Vinci (professional tennis player currently ranked No. 8): "Before the match, I spoke with my coach. He said, 'Don't think that this is your first semifinal in singles. Enjoy the moment.' There are no tactics against Serena. At the beginning, I was nervous. But I think Serena was more nervous than me. She had a lot of pressure. Until the end, I said in my mind, it's impossible that I can win, but try to stay focused every single point. Don't think about Serena."Roberta Vinci celebrates a point against Serena Williams during a 2015 US Open semifinal. Vinci would later win the match. Mike Stobe/Getty Images for the USTAGarrison: "In the tennis community, that loss to Vinci doesn't take anything away from Serena. I was at the match. I knew the pressure would hit her, I just didn't know how and when. When Steffi did it, she didn't have social media. Serena couldn't get away from it if she wanted to."Mouratoglou: "For quite a while, she was really down because she felt like she failed. 'I let them down.' She didn't want to see people. Even though she's had more success than anyone, when she fails, it is more painful than for anyone else. Other players lose every week, or out of 30 weeks, they lose 27 or 28 times. She does not. She had to go through this process. She knew she had time, so she wanted to stay away from tennis, so she did."SEPT. 15, 2015At New York Fashion Week, Serena presents her fall 2015 collection with Home Shopping Network in front of Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, models Gigi Hadid and Lily Aldridge, and Drake. She announces in October that she'll withdraw from the final tournaments of the season, the WTA Finals and the China Open.Serena Williams takes a bow after her fashion line's show during New York Fashion Week in 2015. Fernando Leon/Getty ImagesGrossman: "She had just come off a disappointment at the US Open, and she put herself into this show. She cast all the models. She styled and accessorized every outfit, worked with the hair and makeup artists. She chose every piece of music. During the show, she was behind the scenes making sure the models were going out at the right cadence; everybody is put together in the right way. At the end, she came out and took a bow and looked fabulous in one of her creations."DECEMBER 2015 Sports Illustrated names Serena its Sportsperson of the Year, the first solo female to be awarded the honor since middle-distance runner Mary Decker in 1983. Serena is criticized for the magazine's cover image, in which she is wearing a black lacy bodysuit and stilettos and is seated on a golden throne. Garrison: "Richard and Oracene did a very good job of making all of their girls comfortable within their own skin. Venus and Serena told me that their mom told them every day that they were beautiful, strong women. To hear that every day, and then believe it, is amazing. I've struggled with my weight for years. She tells me, 'Keep going, don't stop.' She's just as encouraging to people around her as she is to the world. I don't think she tries to be a role model to girls, I think she's just true to herself, and that's enough. She doesn't have to prove anything to the doubters anymore."Oracene: "Other athletes would read things in the press and then couldn't do their jobs. So I made them stay away from press. Nothing negative inside their heads. Once you put fear in your head and get scared and doubt yourself, you can collapse. To be successful, you have to have confidence in who you are and what you stand for and the hell with whatever they say. The girls used to say, 'Mom, why do you say you don't care?' Because I don't care what people think. I know who I am."JANUARY 2016 At the Australian Open, Serena looks dominant in the first six matches but loses in three sets to No. 6 Angelique Kerber in the final. She follows with a loss to No. 4 Muguruza in the final of the French Open, marking the first back-to-back Grand Slam final losses in her career.Angelique Kerber (professional tennis player currently ranked No. 2): "It's an honor being on the court with her, and winning against her in Australia was special. She came to me after and was so happy for me that I won my first Grand Slam. This is what is special about her; she was so nice after a really tough match that she lost."Mouratoglou: "All that period, she played good tennis. But one of the things that makes Serena Serena is her mental toughness, her ability to play unbelievable when it's necessary, and this disappeared. She lost it. During that period, she was playing very good tennis. But this killer instinct, she didn't have it. She was not Serena."JULY 9, 2016Serena finds Serena, winning Wimbledon for the seventh time and taking her 22nd Grand Slam title, tying Graf's Open-era record.Serena and Venus Williams celebrate their women's doubles victory at Wimbledon in 2016. Serena also won singles. Ben Queenborough/BPIMouratoglou: "Two days after the French, she called me. I hung up and turned to my business partner and said, 'Serena's back.' She talked to me in a way that was Serena. The champion's mentality, all the things that make her so special, came back. I don't know why it came back at that time. Maybe the loss at the French was one too many. You never know why it clicks. But it clicked."AUGUST 2016 A shoulder injury forces Serena to pull out of the Rogers Cup. But nothing, she says, will keep her from playing in the Rio Olympics. Clearly struggling with pain, she loses in the third round of singles and first round of doubles play and returns home to Palm Beach, Florida, to rehab and prepare for the US Open.Fernandez: "She was a great leader at the Olympics. She walked in the opening ceremony and went to the village a couple of times. She and Venus are big on pin trading, and Serena showed the rookies how to get the most pins. Even though she wasn't 100 percent, she tried her best to get fit and healthy. She didn't want to miss it. I will remember how excited she was to be back at the Olympics."Mouratoglou: "She was injured. She couldn't serve. She had pain playing. If it was any other tournament, she wouldn't have played. Afterward she took a day off, and we got back to work."Serena Williams competes at the 2016 Rio Olympics, where she loses in the third round of singles. ROBERTO SCHMIDT/AFP/Getty ImagesAUG. 12, 2016Home in Florida, Serena Snapchats a video of herself performing her version of the routine that won U.S. gymnast Simone Biles all-around gold the day before in Rio. Mouratoglou: "She had watched gymnastics on TV. She started to do it and then laughed at herself and said, 'Film me.' If I can say something of her character, she is more open to people now. The documentary was the first step. Snapchat is continuing the same. She hasn't changed, but people are getting to know her."AUG. 22, 2016 Serena arrives in New York to begin training for the US Open. Shilstone: "I only have a week to get her ready, so we do crazy things. I hooked her up to cables that launch her like an F-18 to work on acceleration and deceleration while changing direction. We do standing bike sprints. There's a drill I call the fun 'n' gun that's based on my work with Army Rangers. If you look at the motion of the server, it's the same as the release of a shot put, so I have her shot-put a medicine ball."SEPT. 8, 2016Still recovering from her shoulder injury and dealing with a left knee injury suffered in the second round, Serena commits 31 unforced errors and six double faults in a stunning loss to No. 11 Karolina Pliskova in the US Open semifinals. When the world rankings are released four days later, she loses her No. 1 ranking to eventual US Open winner Angelique Kerber, ending her record-tying -- with Steffi Graf -- 186-week streak at No. 1. Two weeks later, she turns 35.Isha: "My first conversation with Serena after that match was, 'What are you watching on TV?' I went to her room at the hotel, and we all chilled together and it wasn't about tennis. It was about being sisters and hanging out, and that's what we did, all of us. She still took her time, and you knew that's what she was thinking about. But it's not what we talked about."When did she start thinking about next season and the Australian Open? The moment she stepped off the court, she was already there."Serena Williams during her semifinal against Karolina Pliskova at the 2016 US Open. Elsa/Getty ImagesNOV. 11, 2016Accompanied by her sisters, mother, niece and nephews, Serena returns to Compton for the first time in years to open the Yetunde Price Resource Center in honor of her late sister. The next day, she and her family return to the East Compton tennis courts where she and Venus learned the game to dedicate newly refurbished courts to the community.Aja Brown (Mayor of Compton): "The impact her presence has on this city is phenomenal. Her coming back is truly a beacon of light. She and Venus were awesome ambassadors and helped to lift the city in a time when it was really tough to be here. The city was plagued with violence and had so many negative connotations with the name Compton. But when we were able to turn on the TV and see Serena winning, dominating the game of tennis, we all felt uplifted. I was a little girl watching her do things I never thought were possible, so to be able to introduce her today was a great honor."Isha: "Serena's doing this 30-day challenge, where she wants to do cardio every day for 30 days. This is a person who doesn't enjoy working out. When we got back to the hotel, it was late. Serena was like, 'I've got to work out. I'm committed to these 30 days.' She went to the gym and did her cardio and then was so energized. Her dedication is inspiring. She's helped all of us."DEC. 30, 2016In a 14-line poem posted to her page on Reddit, Serena announces her engagement to the website's co-founder Alexis Ohanian, whom she's been dating for a year-and-a-half. On his Facebook page, Ohanian posts the words "She said yes," as well as links to Serena's Reddit post.Shilstone: "Serena called me and said, 'Guess what, Mackie? I'm engaged!' She knows I don't follow Twitter and all that. And I said, 'Wow, you're getting married! But what are we first? We're warriors.' I was saying to her, 'Keep your head in the game.' I've been around for eight years, so I've seen a lot of people come and go, and this young man is the real deal. He is a genuine, nice man and she is very happy. I told her, 'Serena, now you'll have to set me up on Reddit like you did on Twitter.'"JANUARY 2017In swirling windy weather, Serena loses 6-4, 6-7 (3), 6-4 to American Madison Brengle in the second round of the ASB Classic in New Zealand, her first tournament since the US Open. After the match, she calls the conditions "my least-favorite I've ever played in" and turns her focus to the Australian Open.Shilstone: "We've been conferring a lot since the US Open. She took a tremendous amount of time off to contend with injuries. Right now, she has some ring rust, and it's going to take a little time to shake it off. Tennis is all about timing, and right now, she's working on her timing. She needs to get it back, and you do that by playing games. She's a seasoned veteran, so it won't take her long."On the first day I met her in New Orleans eight years ago, I asked her, 'Are you at your best?' She said, 'I don't think I've ever been at my best.' If I asked her that question today, I am willing to say she'd tell me the same thing -- because the minute she says, 'Yeah, I'm the best I can be,' it's over."Isha: "I want to see her win 23 for her. She is her own worst critic, her toughest competition, and she's really hard on herself when she doesn't succeed. I'd like to see her win it as soon as possible, but for her. Not for me, not for anybody else. I want that so badly for her."Mouratoglou: "It was good thing she lost early. It helped her to regroup and get ready for the Australian Open. Of course, winning would be good, too, but losing was a wake-up call. Not that she was not doing the right things. She prepared well, but she realized that if she is not 100 percent focused in a match, she can lose. Going into Australia, she knew she had to be 100 percent focused in the first two rounds."JAN. 28, 2017At 5:03 a.m. ET, Serena defeats big sister Venus 6-4, 6-4 in Melbourne to win her seventh Australian Open title and capture her 23rd Grand Slam, giving her more Grand Slam titles than any player in the Open era. There is no arguing it any longer: Serena is the greatest.After the match, Venus addresses the crowd first. She motions toward Serena and says, "That's my little sister, guys. Congratulations, Serena, on No. 23. I have been right there with you. Your win has always been my win. I think you know that I'm enormously proud of you." Serena responds in her speech by saying, "I really would like to take this moment to congratulate Venus. She's an amazing person. There's no way I would be at 23 without her. There's no way I'd be at one without her. There's no way I'd have anything without her. She's my inspiration -- she's the only reason I'm standing here today and the only reason the Williams sisters exist." Serena Williams reacts after winning her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open. SAEED KHAN/AFP/Getty ImagesGarrison: "I watched. Of course I watched. The match was very emotional. Their speeches were heartfelt and humbling, and I heard them speak like I hadn't in a long time. I've known Serena and Venus since they were 7 and 8, and to watch them grow as women on and off the court, overcome all they have, to play in their 30s the way they are playing, it's amazing. They are making their own rules."Being Serena's mentor when she came on tour, she has defied all odds against what people thought she could do. I will never forget Billie Jean King saying to me one day when Serena was young, 'She can be the greatest of all time if she hones it all in.' To watch her wisdom and physical and mental abilities come together to win 23 is exciting. She understands her place in history."Mouratoglou: "It was very emotional. It's the first time since the start of my career with Serena that I had more stress than usual, the whole day. I felt the weight of the history. I tried to hide it as much as I could to her, but there was much more pressure."I don't think playing Venus was a big deal for her. I think the importance of winning the 23rd Slam was much more important than who she plays. She obviously prefers to play someone else but was focused on finding a way to win. She doesn't like to play Venus, but she was happy that Venus was in a final again and back to a great level. There was positive and negative."What's next is to establish her own record. Will it be 23, 25, 30? Nobody knows. But I think it's the most exciting journey for someone like Serena, to make her record."Of course she is still enjoying the game. Otherwise she would have stopped. She loves to play, but she also loves the idea of winning Grand Slams and exploring foreign territory. The fact that we don't know where we're going next, and how far we're going to go, makes it more exciting than beating any record. She is leaving a trace in history and I want this trace to be as big as possible."Additional reporting by Lindsay Berra.

Stephens, 19, beats Serena Williams in Australian OpenNews Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Opinion Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals Subscribe SPORTSStephens, 19, beats Serena Williams in Australian OpenJohn PyeAssociated PressMELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - Sloane Stephens wiped away tears as she thought about hanging a poster of herself on a wall in the place of her childhood hero.The 19-year-old American seemed barely able to compute how she'd produced the upset of the Australian Open by beating 15-time major winner Serena Williams in the quarterfinals Wednesday. It was her first trip that far in seven Grand Slam tournaments.A poster of Williams had adorned the wall on Stephens' bedroom as a child. Now, in her view, they're peers."This is so crazy," Stephens said in a post-match TV interview after rallying from a set and a break down against an injured and angry Williams.The 29th-seeded Stephens won 3-6, 7-5, 6-4. She calmed the nerves and started swinging harder and lifting her tempo at 4-3 in the second.That's when Williams jarred her back trying to pull up before the net as she chased down a drop shot. Williams let out a loud scream and hopped away. Stephens had a look back over the net, seemingly in concern.Williams later called for the trainer between games. She had a three-minute medical timeout and came back serving at a pace well below her usual speed."You think of worst-case scenarios. You know, I just thought, OK, just pretend nothing's wrong and just try your best," she said.Stephens had practiced with Williams for the Fed Cup, but had played her only once, a straight sets loss at the Brisbane International earlier this month."Brisbane helped me because I got the first time we played out of the way," she said. "First time is always tough. Definitely I was glad that I got it there. ... It helped me raise my level."Top-ranked Novak Djokovic will continue his bid for a third consecutive Australian title Thursday when he takes on No. 4 David Ferrer. No. 2 Roger Federer and No. 3 Andy Murray will meet Friday.Federer, a 17-time Grand Slam champ, hadn't dropped serve in the tournament until the first set against 2008 finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Wednesday. He ended up with a struggle on his hands before advancing with a five-set win in 3 hours, 34 minutes.Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Site Map Legals Public notice certification Our Ethical Principles Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Licensing & Reprints Legal Notices Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Give FeedbackSubscribe Today Newsletters Facebook Twitter Instagram eNewspaper NIE PR LinkJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Pay Your Ad Bill Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions USA TODAY Sports+© 2023 www.jacksonville.com.

IndexHere MagazineTo celebrate the launch of her second collection with Away, tennis champion Serena Williams counts down the top four places she’s dreaming of traveling post-pandemic—including her favorite city on Earth.
For a moment, close your eyes and dream of traveling again.
Imagine the taste of flaky croissants fresh from a bakery in Paris; the warmth of the Italian sun on your shoulders; the childlike curiosity that draws you to San Francisco’s vibrant streets and rolling hills; the immense calm of a morning stroll along a Miami beach.
Memories like these keep us tethered to our past trips and inspire us to dream of future excursions. And after months of being homebound, travelers everywhere are longing to experience the world again—including tennis star Serena Williams.
Life as a pro athlete comes with a regular dose of international travel, and while Williams may still be (safely) on the road for tournaments, she’s looking forward to fully immersing herself in her favorite destinations. To celebrate the launch of Away’s latest collaboration with the grand-slam champ, we asked Williams to share the top four places she’s dreaming of returning to once travel is back—and what makes each of them irreplaceable in her eyes.
For Serena Williams, the work is never done →
Miami: The quintessential city for beachgoers, art lovers, all-night partiers, and sports superstars alike. Photo by Zarpe 77.1. Miami, Florida
What made you fall in love with Miami? 
Miami has something for everyone. Between the amazing art scene, the food, the culture, and a wide range of sporting events (let’s go, Miami Dolphins!), you can never run out of things to do. It just has such a beautiful vibrance to it. I’ve made so many amazing memories in Miami, and I cannot wait to make many more.
What’s your first (or favorite) memory of Miami? 
The S by Serena pop-up shops at Art Basel or my bridal shower at 1 Hotel South Beach.
What restaurants or meals from Miami do you crave most? 
NOBU. I love Japanese food, and once you have NOBU, there’s no turning back. I’ve been to a lot of different NOBU locations over the years, but the one in Miami is one of my favorites. It’s part of the Eden Roc Hotel, and between the food, views, atmosphere, service, and overall glamour, it’s an experience I always look forward to. 
[Otherwise,] I don’t necessarily have a go-to restaurant because I’d rather explore as much of the city as possible. You can truly go anywhere in Miami and find a fun atmosphere and delicious food and drinks. That’s part of why I love the city. There’s an adventure around every corner.

What made you fall in love with San Francisco? 
To me, San Francisco feels like a small town. It’s beautiful and big, but when you’re there, you feel like a part of the community. I’ve always been attracted to it, and I envision myself settling down there and just being a mom. 
What’s your first (or favorite) memory of San Francisco?
One day I took a trip to Dolores Park, and while I was out exploring the area with [my husband] Alexis, I saw these two random guys playing tennis. I literally dropped everything to play with them, and I had such a blast doing it. I think they were pretty surprised.
What restaurants or meals from San Francisco do you crave most?
Mission Chinese. I love Asian cuisine, and Mission’s menu is creative and unique while still having the classics that everyone enjoys. Everything I’ve ordered is delicious. Plus, the atmosphere in the restaurant is perfect for a lowkey date night. It has almost a dive-bar feel with a five-star menu. Plus, they deliver, which is always a perk. [I also love] any Mexican food restaurant or donuts from San Francisco. I know those two sound unrelated, but this city has such a great range of options no matter what you are craving.

What made you fall in love with Paris? 
I lived there for a few years. I learned French and had the opportunity to experience the beautiful European culture.
What’s your first (or favorite) memory of Paris? 
Shopping at Rue Saint-Honoré in Paris. Great street with the best boutiques. 
What restaurants or meals from Paris do you crave most? 
APICIUS—it’s gorgeous. From the moment you approach the building, the elegance is obvious. It used to be a chateau and was built in 1860. You just feel like royalty there, and I love to bring my friends whenever I can. It’s glamorous, the food is delicious, and you feel like you’ve been teleported into a fairy tale whenever you’re there. Cinderella and Belle would definitely hang out there. 
And coffee. I’m not sure if it’s the actual coffee or just the overall vibe of being at a cute local cafe, but I love it. I could people-watch for hours at Paris cafes, and having a yummy fresh pastry to go along with it makes it even better.

As the city where she met her lifelong partner, Rome will forever have Williams' heart. Photo by KaLisa Veer.4. Rome, Italy
What made you fall in love with Rome?
How can you not? So much history, so many amazing moments. It’s my favorite place in the world! 
What’s your first (or favorite) memory of Rome? 
Meeting my husband, Alexis.

What restaurants or meals from Rome do you crave most? 
L’Isola della Pizza. In my opinion, they have the best pizza in the city!
When in Rome, any type of pasta or pizza works (gluten-free, of course)! Even for breakfast! I mean c’mon—when you think Italy, you think pasta and pizza. The fresh ingredients and home-cooked taste are unlike anything you can get in the States. I can’t get enough.

17 Things You Didn’t Know About Serena Williams
Girlboss

















Serena Williams is one of the greatest tennis players of all time, and that’s only one of the many cool things about her. There’s more Serena Williams facts worth knowing.
You may already be aware that she has won 308 grand slams and four Olympic gold medals (NBD). And unless you’ve been living off the grid for the past month, you probably also know she just had a baby girl with her husband and Reddit co-founder, Alex Ohanian.
But as amazing as Serena is as both a mother and a tennis player, she’s just an incredible all-around human being. So, in honor of the champion’s 36th birthday, here are 17 additional Serena Williams facts to brush up on.
1. Serena’s favorite city is Rome.
Which makes her meet-cute with now-husband Alex Ohanian even cuter. (The couple reportedly met at the Hotel Cavalieri Hilton in Rome back in 2015.)
2. Tigers and dogs are Serena’s favorite animals.
And she’s mom to an adorable Yorkshire terrier named Chip.

3. The song that Serena is most embarrassed to have stored in her iPhone is “MMMBop” by Hanson, according to espnW.
OMG, same.
4. The oddest thing in Serena’s gym bag is apparently OPI nail polish.
Which makes sense, considering she has her own OPI line.

5. Serena’s middle name is Jameka.
“Queen Serena Jameka Williams” has a nice ring to it, no?
6. The tennis star’s go-to gadget in the kitchen is her toaster oven.
7. Serena’s been playing tennis since she was three years old.
Suffice it to say, she got those 10,000 hours of practice in.

8. Her favorite author is Maya Angelou.
9. Along with Alicia Keys, Kerry Washington, and Kanye West, Serena Williams appeared in Common’s music video back in 2007.
Serena and the rapper were reportedly dating at the time.







10. Serena was born in Saginaw, Michigan.
11. Her favorite color is purple, according to Boomsbeat.
And purple’s favorite is Serena.

12. She lives with her family in Palm Beach, Florida.
13. Two of Serena’s favorite singers are Mariah Carey and Brandy.
According to Venus and Serena Williams: A Biography.
14. Serena and her mom are Jehovah’s Witnesses, they’ve held this faith since the early ’80s.
15. Serena speaks French fluently, and she’s been known to conduct on-court interviews in French whenever she plays matches in France.
Comment dit-on “badass” en Française?

16. Serena helped build a school in Uganda.
Plus, her non-profit, the Serena Williams Fund, has funded schools in Jamaica, Kenya, and Uganda.

17. Serena’s dabbled in acting over the years, appearing in shows like Drop Dead Diva and Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.

“I have never liked the word retirement," says Williams, seen here with her daughter, Olympia. "It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me.” Balenciaga gown. Bulgari High Jewelry earring.Photographed by Luis Alberto Rodriguez, Vogue, September 2022.MagazineSerena Williams Says Farewell to Tennis On Her Own Terms—And In Her Own WordsBy Serena WilliamsAs told to Rob HaskellPhotography by Luis Alberto RodriguezStyled by Gabriella Karefa-JohnsonAugust 9, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryFacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryThis morning, my daughter, Olympia, who turns five this month, and I were on our way to get her a new passport before a trip to Europe. We’re in my car, and she’s holding my phone, using an interactive educational app she likes. This robot voice asks her a question: What do you want to be when you grow up? She doesn’t know I’m listening, but I can hear the answer she whispers into the phone. She says, “I want to be a big sister.”STANDING TALL

Olympia says this a lot, even when she knows I’m listening. Sometimes before bed, she prays to Jehovah to bring her a baby sister. (She doesn’t want anything to do with a boy!) I’m the youngest of five sisters myself, and my sisters are my heroes, so this has felt like a moment I need to listen very carefully to.Believe me, I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don’t think it’s fair. If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family. Maybe I’d be more of a Tom Brady if I had that opportunity. Don’t get me wrong: I love being a woman, and I loved every second of being pregnant with Olympia. I was one of those annoying women who adored being pregnant and was working until the day I had to report to the hospital—although things got super complicated on the other side. And I almost did do the impossible: A lot of people don’t realize that I was two months pregnant when I won the Australian Open in 2017. But I’m turning 41 this month, and something’s got to give.I’ve been reluctant to admit that I have to move on from playing tennis. It’s like a taboo topic. It comes up, and I start to cry. I think the only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapistI have never liked the word retirement. It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me. I’ve been thinking of this as a transition, but I want to be sensitive about how I use that word, which means something very specific and important to a community of people. Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to is evolution. I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me. A few years ago I quietly started Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm. Soon after that, I started a family. I want to grow that family.But I’ve been reluctant to admit to myself or anyone else that I have to move on from playing tennis. Alexis, my husband, and I have hardly talked about it; it’s like a taboo topic. I can’t even have this conversation with my mom and dad. It’s like it’s not real until you say it out loud. It comes up, I get an uncomfortable lump in my throat, and I start to cry. The only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapist! One thing I’m not going to do is sugarcoat this. I know that a lot of people are excited about and look forward to retiring, and I really wish I felt that way. Ashleigh Barty was number one in the world when she left the sport this March, and I believe she really felt ready to move on. Caroline Wozniacki, who is one of my best friends, felt a sense of relief when she retired in 2020.LIVING LEGENDS

Praise to these people, but I’m going to be honest. There is no happiness in this topic for me. I know it’s not the usual thing to say, but I feel a great deal of pain. It’s the hardest thing that I could ever imagine. I hate it. I hate that I have to be at this crossroads. I keep saying to myself, I wish it could be easy for me, but it’s not. I’m torn: I don’t want it to be over, but at the same time I’m ready for what’s next. I don’t know how I’m going to be able to look at this magazine when it comes out, knowing that this is it, the end of a story that started in Compton, California, with a little Black girl who just wanted to play tennis. This sport has given me so much. I love to win. I love the battle. I love to entertain. I’m not sure every player sees it that way, but I love the performance aspect of it—to be able to entertain people week after week. Some of the happiest times in my life were spent waiting in that hallway in Melbourne, and walking out into Rod Laver Arena with my earphones in and trying to stay focused and drown out the noise but still feeling the energy of the crowd. Night matches in Arthur Ashe Stadium at Flushing Meadows. Hitting an ace on set point.My whole life, up to now, has been tennis. My dad says I first picked up a racket when I was three, but I think it was even earlier. There’s a picture of Venus pushing me in a stroller on a tennis court, and I couldn’t have been more than 18 months. Unlike Venus, who’s always been stoic and classy, I’ve never been one to contain my emotions. I remember learning to write my alphabet for kindergarten and not doing it perfectly and crying all night. I was so angry about it. I’d erase and rewrite that A over and over, and my mother let me stay up all night while my sisters were in bed. That’s always been me. I want to be great. I want to be perfect. I know perfect doesn’t exist, but whatever my perfect was, I never wanted to stop until I got it right.To me that’s kind of the essence of being Serena: expecting the best from myself and proving people wrong. There were so many matches I won because something made me angry or someone counted me out. That drove me. I’ve built a career on channeling anger and negativity and turning it into something good. My sister Venus once said that when someone out there says you can’t do something, it is because they can’t do it. But I did do it. And so can you.POWER PLAYER

If you watched King Richard, then you know that when I was little, I was not very good at tennis. I was so sad when I didn’t get all the early opportunities that Venus got, but that helped me. It made me work harder, turning me into a savage fighter. I’d travel to tournaments with Venus as her hitting partner, and if there was an open slot, I’d play. I followed her around the world and watched her. When she lost, I understood why, and I made sure I wouldn’t lose the same way. That’s how I started to move so fast up the rankings, because I learned the lessons from Venus’s losses instead of the hard way, from my own. It was as if I were playing her matches, too. I’m a good mimic. Growing up I tried to copy Pete Sampras. I loved Monica Seles, and then I studied Monica Seles. I watched, I listened, then I attacked. But if I hadn’t been in Venus’s shadow, I would never be who I am. When someone said I was just the little sister, that’s when I got really fired up.I started playing tennis with the goal of winning the U.S. Open. I didn’t think past that. And then I just kept winning. I remember when I passed Martina Hingis’s grand slam count. Then Seles’s. And then I tied Billie Jean King, who is such an inspiration for me because of how she has pioneered gender equality in all sports. Then it was climbing over the Chris Evert–Martina Navratilova mountain. There are people who say I’m not the GOAT because I didn’t pass Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam titles, which she achieved before the “open era” that began in 1968. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want that record. Obviously I do. But day to day, I’m really not thinking about her. If I’m in a grand slam final, then yes, I am thinking about that record. Maybe I thought about it too much, and that didn’t help. The way I see it, I should have had 30-plus grand slams. I had my chances after coming back from giving birth. I went from a C-section to a second pulmonary embolism to a grand slam final. I played while breastfeeding. I played through postpartum depression. But I didn’t get there. Shoulda, woulda, coulda. I didn’t show up the way I should have or could have. But I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine. Actually it’s extraordinary. But these days, if I have to choose between building my tennis résumé and building my family, I choose the latter.QUEEN OF THE COURT
Photographed by Annie Leibovitz in Vogue, April 2015. 
Earlier in my career, I never thought about having kids. There were times when I’ve wondered if I should ever bring kids into this world, with all its problems. I was never that confident or comfortable around babies or children, and I figured that if I ever did have a baby, I would have people taking care of it 24/7. I’m not going to lie—I definitely have a lot of support. But I’m also an incredibly hands-on mother. My husband will tell you I am too hands-on. In five years, Olympia has only spent one 24-hour period away from me. This past year, while I was recovering from a hamstring injury, I got to pick her up from school four or five days a week, and I always looked forward to seeing her face light up when she walked out of the building and saw me waiting there for her. The fact is that nothing is a sacrifice for me when it comes to Olympia. It all just makes sense. I want to teach her how to tie her shoes, how to read, where babies come from, and about God. Just like my mom taught me. As she grows, it’s something different every month. Lately she’s been into watching baking shows, which we do together. Now we bake with Play-Doh, which is so much fun. She loves this game called The Floor Is Lava, where you have to do whatever you can to avoid touching the ground. I love setting up my gym for the game, arranging my step-up boxes and weight machines like an obstacle course. Whatever she likes, I like.AT EASE

I think tennis, by comparison, has always felt like a sacrifice—though it’s one I enjoyed making. When you’re younger, you see kids having fun, and you want to do that stuff but you know you have to be on the court, hoping that one day it will all pay off. I got pushed hard by my parents. Nowadays so many parents say, “Let your kids do what they want!” Well, that’s not what got me where I am. I didn’t rebel as a kid. I worked hard, and I followed the rules. I do want to push Olympia—not in tennis, but in whatever captures her interest. But I don’t want to push too hard. I’m still trying to figure out that balance.In my own life, the balance has been slowly shifting toward Serena Ventures. I always say that I’m a sponge: At night I go to bed and I squeeze myself out so that the next day I can take up as much new information as I can. Every morning, I’m so excited to walk downstairs to my office and jump onto Zooms and start reviewing decks of companies we’re considering investing in. We’re a small but growing firm of six people scattered between Florida, where I mainly live, Texas, and California. I started investing nine years ago, and I really fell in love with early stage, whether it’s pre-seed funding, where you’re investing in just an idea, or seed, where the idea has already been turned into a product. I wrote one of the very first checks for MasterClass. It’s one of 16 unicorns—companies valued at more than $1 billion—that Serena Ventures has funded, along with Tonal, Impossible Foods, Noom, and Esusu, to name a few. This year we raised $111 million of outside financing, from banks, private individuals, and family offices. Seventy-​eight percent of our portfolio happens to be companies started by women and people of color, because that’s who we are. On the other hand, my husband is white, and it’s important to me to be inclusive of everyone. Serena Ventures has been an all-female business until recently, when we brought in our first guy—a diversity hire!FEELING GRAND

A few years ago, I was at a conference organized by JPMorgan Chase, where I watched a talk between Jamie Dimon and Caryn Seidman-Becker, the CEO of the security company Clear. Caryn explained that less than 2 percent of all VC money went to women. I figured that she misspoke. I thought, There’s no way that 98 percent of that capital is going to men. I approached her afterward, and she confirmed it. I kind of understood then and there that someone who looks like me needs to start writing the big checks. Sometimes like attracts like. Men are writing those big checks to one another, and in order for us to change that, more people who look like me need to be in that position, giving money back to themselves. I’m so grateful to women like Caryn, as well as Sheryl Sandberg and others who have mentored me. It’s important to have women like that who believe in you and push you to think bigger and do bigger.I’d like to think that thanks to me, women athletes can be themselves. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it allIn the last year, Alexis and I have been trying to have another child, and we recently got some information from my doctor that put my mind at ease and made me feel that whenever we’re ready, we can add to our family. I definitely don’t want to be pregnant again as an athlete. I need to be two feet into tennis or two feet out.This spring, I had the itch to get back on the court for the first time in seven months. I was talking to Tiger Woods, who’s a friend, and I told him I needed his advice on my tennis career. I said, “I don’t know what to do: I think I’m over it, but maybe I’m not over it.” He’s Tiger, and he was adamant that I be a beast the same way he is! He said, “Serena, what if you just gave it two weeks? You don’t have to commit to anything. You just go out on the court every day for two weeks and give it your all and see what happens.” I said, “All right, I think I can do that.” And I didn’t do it. But a month later, I gave it a try. And it felt magical to pick up a racket again. And I was good. I was really good. I went back and forth about whether to play Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open after that. As I’ve said, this whole evolution thing has not been easy for me.I don’t particularly like to think about my legacy. I get asked about it a lot, and I never know exactly what to say. But I’d like to think that thanks to opportunities afforded to me, women athletes feel that they can be themselves on the court. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can be strong yet beautiful. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it all. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career. Mistakes are learning experiences, and I embrace those moments. I’m far from perfect, but I’ve also taken a lot of criticism, and I’d like to think that I went through some hard times as a professional tennis player so that the next generation could have it easier. Over the years, I hope that people come to think of me as symbolizing something bigger than tennis. I admire Billie Jean because she transcended her sport. I’d like it to be: Serena is this and she’s that and she was a great tennis player and she won those slams.Unfortunately I wasn’t ready to win Wimbledon this year. And I don’t know if I will be ready to win New York. But I’m going to try. And the lead-up tournaments will be fun. I know there’s a fan fantasy that I might have tied Margaret that day in London, then maybe beat her record in New York, and then at the trophy ceremony say, “See ya!” I get that. It’s a good fantasy. But I’m not looking for some ceremonial, final on-court moment. I’m terrible at goodbyes, the world’s worst. But please know that I am more grateful for you than I can ever express in words. You have carried me to so many wins and so many trophies. I’m going to miss that version of me, that girl who played tennis. And I’m going to miss you. HAPPY DAYS

The greatest female athlete of all time—check that: perhaps the greatest athlete of all time—has been thinking a lot about the reason she’s vowed to hang up her racket for good. “Olympia doesn’t like when I play tennis,” Serena Williams says plainly about her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. When Williams told Olympia, who turns 5 on Sept. 1, that she was soon to be done with the life that made her an inspiration to millions, Olympia’s reply was as joyful as her mother’s celebrations after so many Grand Slam wins: a fist-pumping “Yes!” 


 “That kind of makes me sad,” says Williams, leaning forward in her chair in the library of a New York City hotel. “And brings anxiety to my heart.” No kid understands their parent’s absence. But Williams has spent the last few years of her incomparable career tormented by what she’s been sacrificing in order to keep going. “It’s hard to completely commit,” says Williams, “when your flesh and blood is saying, Aw.”

 Olympia would also like to be a big sister. One day in August, she blew on a dandelion, wishing for a baby sister. “This is what I have to deal with, on a daily,” Williams says, with the commiseration familiar to all parents of young kids. And yet choosing this path requires a calculus that superstar fathers don’t have to make. Tom Brady, father of three, can retire and unretire at 44; LeBron James, father of three, can sign a two-year, $97.1 million contract extension at 37. “It comes to a point where women sometimes have to make different choices than men, if they want to raise a family,” says Williams, who turns 41 in late September. “It’s just black and white. You make a choice or you don’t.” 


 
Biology may have forced her hand, but Williams insists she’s at peace with her decision. “There is no anger,” she says. “I’m ready for the transition.” She’s thought about what’s next, without knowing how it will feel. Williams will re-direct her curiosity and drive into her investment firm, Serena Ventures. She’ll kindle her spiritual life. She’ll evolve as a mom. “I think I’m good at it,” she says of parenthood. “But I want to explore if I can be great at it.” 
 Greatness is something she knows well. No tennis player, male or female, has won more major championships in the Open Era—the period starting in 1968 when the Grand Slam tournaments allowed professionals—than Serena Williams. (Australia’s Margaret Court owns the all-time record, with 24 Grand Slams.) Williams earned 10 of those 23 titles after the age of 30, a time when most players retire or plummet in the rankings. But for all that Williams accomplished on the court, it’s what she has meant off the court that makes her the most consequential athlete of the 21st century, full stop. She, along with older sister Venus, took over a country-club sport with resistance to a pair of Black sisters from Compton, Calif., baked into its DNA. She helped change behavioral expectations for female athletes, and by extension women in all workplaces, by exuding power and passion—and bringing her full self—to her hard-court office. She rewrote the book on body image. When pundits, racists, and no small number of idiots slurred her physical appearance or laughed her off as “masculine,” she doubled down on photo shoots and flexes.

 Her very being sparked a multitude of crucial conversations. In 2018, her run to the Wimbledon final—months after Olympia’s delivery led to a life-threatening pulmonary embolism and hematoma that required multiple surgeries—inspired millions of moms. But that chatter shifted, in an instant. On a September afternoon, a male umpire penalized Williams at a key moment in the U.S. Open final, for a verbal outburst. She argued that men got away with much worse. Serena lost to Naomi Osaka, and the fallout prompted debates about decorum, fair play, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, letter of the law, spirit of the law, and unconscious biases. 
 All from a Serena Williams tennis match. Osaka, who has since won three more Grand Slams, never would have picked up a tennis racket if it weren’t for Williams. “I remember as a kid watching in awe, and I was so happy to be seeing a strong Black woman on my screen,” she tells TIME. “Even though she is retiring, her legacy definitely lives on through Coco [Gauff], Sloane [Stephens], Madison [Keys], and other women of color at the top of their game. Serena is unequivocally the best athlete ever. Forget female athlete, I mean athlete. No one else has changed her sport as much as she did and against all odds.” When informed of Osaka’s comment during our late-August conversation in New York, Williams demurs when the talk turns to being the GOAT. That is, up to a point. “I don’t know any other person that has won a Grand Slam or a championship in the NBA or anything else nine weeks pregnant,” she says. She laughs, a habit when she wants to make a serious point. “A two-week event. That tournament, I relied on my brain. An athlete isn’t just about what an animal you are physically, like a specimen. It’s using everything. Your mind, your body, everything. And doing that for 20 years. And doing it against people that come against you and play the best game of their life. Every single time. 
 “You can come to your own conclusion after that.”  The Williams sisters’ backstory is filled with tales of their competitive exploits. “There was a rage, a burning desire that I’ve never seen in two little girls, ever,” says Rick Macci, one of Venus and Serena’s earliest coaches. “And I haven’t seen to this day.” Richard Williams’ genius was that while many tennis dads suffocate their children, he nurtured their talent while encouraging them to be kids. On rainy days at Macci’s Florida training facility, they’d study in his office. Richard kept them off the junior circuit, on the advice of absolutely no one. After they faced Hall of Fame legends Billie Jean King and Rosie Casals in an exhibition doubles match, Macci heard both sisters complimenting their own performances. He turned around. Venus, 11, and Serena, 10, were talking to a doll.

 Childlike curiosity intact, the sisters went on to learn multiple languages and diversify their interests. Serena has dabbled in finance, fashion, acting, and film production; she’s on track to be the first female athlete to become a billionaire. Early in her career, she faced criticism for moonlighting outside of tennis. She was supposedly unfocused, distracted. She again rewrote the rules. Expanding her palette prevented the burnout that previously plagued so many players. No woman has won more big matches in her later years. 
 Williams conquered her first major, the 1999 U.S. Open, at 17. “It really was a different mentality of tennis,” says Chris Evert, the 18-time major champion. “Go for everything. When you’re under pressure, you’re more aggressive.” Serena and Venus wore braids with beads in those early years on tour. Even this seemingly small fashion choice carried meaning. “The tennis world was not accustomed to seeing Black girls show up adorned in styles reflecting their African American cultural heritage, as opposed to wearing styles that blended in,” says Tera Hunter, a professor of African American studies at Princeton University.

 Around this time, Williams met Kelly Rowland, of the pop supergroup Destiny’s Child, after a concert. She invited Rowland to come to a match. “I’m going to be really good,” Serena vowed. “As soon as she said that, I was struck by her,” says Rowland. She remembers sitting in Serena’s box during a match when she was down a set. “You feel an energy shift,” says Rowland. “Something’s about to happen. It’s watching her get upset, like we do as people, and then understanding she had to calm herself down. It was her having this controlled kind of space she had made for herself. And then it was about her dominating. And it was so unapologetic. It wasn’t anything she had to say. It was like, ‘I’m about to take back what’s mine.’ I needed that at that moment. It fed me.” 
 It wasn’t just women who were taking cues from the Williams sisters. An aspiring young race-car driver named Lewis Hamilton tuned in to Venus’ and Serena’s matches from a public housing complex north of London. “They were the two most inspiring sports figures for me,” Hamilton tells TIME. “Especially growing up in my sport, where I’m the only person of color, seeing these two prominent figures, also the only people of color, really gave me a lot of confidence that I can do something similar. It’s not impossible.” Hamilton, winner of seven Formula One titles—tied for the most in history—has also bonded with Serena. She carries a small microphone in her handbag when they go out, for impromptu karaoke.  Over a quarter-century on tour, Williams has had her share of downturns. She suffered knee, ankle, shoulder, foot, hamstring, and Achilles injuries. She grieved the death of older sister Yetunde Price, who was killed in a 2003 shooting, in a case of mistaken identity. She was vilified at the 2009 U.S. Open for threatening a lineswoman after a foot-fault call. Williams apologized. And then she won two more Slams the next year. In February 2011, Williams was supposed to fly from Los Angeles to New York City, before going off to London for a fashion show. She canceled plans at the last minute, choosing to hang out with Venus instead. That night, she checked into a hospital with breathing difficulties: she suffered a pulmonary embolism and had blood clotting in her lungs. If she had been stuck on a cross-country flight, Williams believes she more than likely would have died. She thought she’d never play tennis again. Ten more Grand Slams followed. 
 When Williams found out she was pregnant right before the 2017 Australian Open, she played on with little hesitation. “Athletes understand their bodies a million times better than the rest of us,” says her husband Alexis Ohanian, the venture-capital investor who co-founded Reddit. “Even though the doctor was like, ‘You’ve got to take it easy, 100° heat, yadda, yadda, yadda,’ Serena said, ‘I got this.’ As long as she was confident, I was confident.” Serena told her husband that she didn’t drop a set the entire tournament because she knew it was best to get off the court quickly, for the baby’s sake. The victory broke Steffi Graf’s Open Era record for major titles.

The Olympic gold medalist discovered she was pregnant the next year, in 2018; she continued training and competing. Like Williams, Felix had a life-threatening delivery of her daughter: after developing preeclampsia. Felix watched as Williams grinded her way back, ascending to the Wimbledon and U.S. Open finals in the year after Olympia was born. Felix charted a similar path. At the Tokyo Olympics, at 35, Felix won bronze in the 400-m and a relay gold to become the most decorated female Olympic track-and-field athlete in history, and pass Carl Lewis for the most Olympic track-and-field medals won by an American. “I was heavily influenced by her experience and the comeback,” says Felix. “Here’s the ultimate example that it can be done.” 
 As her career extended, Williams publicly embraced causes she had long valued privately. In 2015, she again played at Indian Wells, the prominent Southern California tournament she had boycotted since 2001 after feeling an undercurrent of racist jeering. (Fans were angry that Venus pulled out of a semifinal against Serena with an injury; they were convinced that Richard had engineered that outcome.) As part of her return, Williams helped raise money for the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit dedicated to racial justice and fighting mass incarceration. “Serena’s not just taking punches, she punches back,” says Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza. “She’s showing us that it’s important to belong to yourself. And ultimately, that is a motto that I hold, and I know that’s one that she lives.” Rowland gets emotional when asked to try to describe her friend’s influence on the world. “For a young Black girl, to have survived the spaces where she wasn’t welcomed, she stood with pride,” says Rowland. “She represented for all of us, when we couldn’t do it. She made it OK. Claim your space. Even when they’re calling you words you’d never answer to. You can’t hear it. Don’t hear it. I’m sure that was a very scary place to be. But to do it, and you’re the first to do it, the way you do it, with our own unique way, with style and with grace and unapologetic of your greatness,” Rowland says, choking back tears. “That took some … f-cking guts.” 
  It’s been too long a road for Williams to shy away from what she’s done. She owns it. Deservedly. Unapologetically. And it’s rooted in what she knows she and her sister have meant to the sport that they both shaped and were shaped by. “We changed the game of tennis,” Williams says. “We changed how people play, period. People never attacked. People never took balls early. People never served like this. People never had to play so hard to beat two Black girls from Compton.” Off the court, she’s helped transform beauty standards—often in the face of crass scrutiny and racist tropes. “A lot of people feel they’re not pretty or they’re not cute enough because their skin is dark,” she says. But she insists she never felt that way, despite all the shots directed her way. “I think people could feel my confidence, because I was always told, ‘You look great. Be Black and be proud.’” There were too few prominent examples in mainstream sports before Venus and Serena—and few who won so regularly and defiantly. “Giving them that confidence, that motivation, is something that has literally never been done,” says Williams. “You don’t let the world decide beauty. And me being thicker or whatever, I mean, curves are popular now. Butts are popular. I’m trying to lose mine, and people are trying to get mine.”

 Knowing insight delivered in a self-deprecating package is a Williams signature. But press a little and she states plainly what she believes her legacy is. “Confidence and self-belief,” Williams says. “And teaching other Black kids, in particular Black girls, they can do it too.” She lists the current top Black players on the pro tour—like Osaka and Gauff and Stephens—who represent the emergent generation. “No one has ever been able to tell such an inspiring, authentic story,” she says. “You live through my mistakes. You live through my ups, you live through my downs. The surgeries, and the comebacks. And it’s also a tale of never letting anyone write your story. A lot of people can relate to that. Always be authentically you. Own who you are. And love you. It’s a big tale of self-love.”

She bawled while working on her Aug. 9 Vogue essay announcing her imminent farewell. Walking away from the game you’ve spent your life mastering is complicated. And it’s not to say she won’t decide to pick up a racket again one day. But her next chapter isn’t about finding 5 o’clock somewhere. Serena Ventures has invested in more than a dozen companies now worth more than $1 billion, including Master-Class, Impossible Foods, and Tonal. Nearly 80% of the companies in the firm’s portfolio were founded by women or people of color. “It’s not that I’ve lost my passion for tennis,” Williams says. “I just get more love and more joy out of what I do in the VC space.”

 But expanding her family is paramount. “I can’t imagine my life without my sisters,” she says. “When I look at Olympia, I’m really not performing at my peak, by not trying harder to give her that sibling. Coming from a big family, and coming from five, there’s nothing better.” 
 As Williams prepped for the U.S. Open, she felt her game finally coming along after such a long layoff. Before Wimbledon, where she lost in the first round, Williams hadn’t played in a year because of a hamstring injury. The progress is bittersweet. “I can see my improvement, and I’m like, Dang, I’ll be good in January,” she says. Once the Australian Open comes along, she might pine for another trip down under. “I’m already thinking that,” Williams says. But would she go? “I’m not doing that,” she insists. So this is it. One last dance in New York City. One final message to millions. “Thank you so much,” she says. “I am so overwhelmed. It’s just been an incredible, incredible ride, and I’m so happy that you guys are on it with me.” Williams stops, nods, brings her hands together, in the blessed position. “And I love you.” —With reporting by Mariah Espada and Julia Zorthian  Styled by Kesha McLeod; hair by Dhairius; make-up by Nadia Tayeh

We’re in my car, and she’s holding my phone, using an interactive educational app she likes. This robot voice asks her a question: What do you want to be when you grow up? She doesn’t know I’m listening, but I can hear the answer she whispers into the phone. She says, “I want to be a big sister.”STANDING TALL

Olympia says this a lot, even when she knows I’m listening. Sometimes before bed, she prays to Jehovah to bring her a baby sister. (She doesn’t want anything to do with a boy!) I’m the youngest of five sisters myself, and my sisters are my heroes, so this has felt like a moment I need to listen very carefully to.Believe me, I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don’t think it’s fair. If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family. Maybe I’d be more of a Tom Brady if I had that opportunity. Don’t get me wrong: I love being a woman, and I loved every second of being pregnant with Olympia. I was one of those annoying women who adored being pregnant and was working until the day I had to report to the hospital—although things got super complicated on the other side. And I almost did do the impossible: A lot of people don’t realize that I was two months pregnant when I won the Australian Open in 2017. But I’m turning 41 this month, and something’s got to give.I’ve been reluctant to admit that I have to move on from playing tennis. It’s like a taboo topic. It comes up, and I start to cry. I think the only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapistI have never liked the word retirement. It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me. I’ve been thinking of this as a transition, but I want to be sensitive about how I use that word, which means something very specific and important to a community of people. Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to is evolution. I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me. A few years ago I quietly started Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm. Soon after that, I started a family. I want to grow that family.But I’ve been reluctant to admit to myself or anyone else that I have to move on from playing tennis. Alexis, my husband, and I have hardly talked about it; it’s like a taboo topic. I can’t even have this conversation with my mom and dad. It’s like it’s not real until you say it out loud. It comes up, I get an uncomfortable lump in my throat, and I start to cry. The only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapist! One thing I’m not going to do is sugarcoat this. I know that a lot of people are excited about and look forward to retiring, and I really wish I felt that way. Ashleigh Barty was number one in the world when she left the sport this March, and I believe she really felt ready to move on. Caroline Wozniacki, who is one of my best friends, felt a sense of relief when she retired in 2020.LIVING LEGENDS

Praise to these people, but I’m going to be honest. There is no happiness in this topic for me. I know it’s not the usual thing to say, but I feel a great deal of pain. It’s the hardest thing that I could ever imagine. I hate it. I hate that I have to be at this crossroads. I keep saying to myself, I wish it could be easy for me, but it’s not. I’m torn: I don’t want it to be over, but at the same time I’m ready for what’s next. I don’t know how I’m going to be able to look at this magazine when it comes out, knowing that this is it, the end of a story that started in Compton, California, with a little Black girl who just wanted to play tennis. This sport has given me so much. I love to win. I love the battle. I love to entertain. I’m not sure every player sees it that way, but I love the performance aspect of it—to be able to entertain people week after week. Some of the happiest times in my life were spent waiting in that hallway in Melbourne, and walking out into Rod Laver Arena with my earphones in and trying to stay focused and drown out the noise but still feeling the energy of the crowd. Night matches in Arthur Ashe Stadium at Flushing Meadows. Hitting an ace on set point.My whole life, up to now, has been tennis. My dad says I first picked up a racket when I was three, but I think it was even earlier. There’s a picture of Venus pushing me in a stroller on a tennis court, and I couldn’t have been more than 18 months. Unlike Venus, who’s always been stoic and classy, I’ve never been one to contain my emotions. I remember learning to write my alphabet for kindergarten and not doing it perfectly and crying all night. I was so angry about it. I’d erase and rewrite that A over and over, and my mother let me stay up all night while my sisters were in bed. That’s always been me. I want to be great. I want to be perfect. I know perfect doesn’t exist, but whatever my perfect was, I never wanted to stop until I got it right.To me that’s kind of the essence of being Serena: expecting the best from myself and proving people wrong. There were so many matches I won because something made me angry or someone counted me out. That drove me. I’ve built a career on channeling anger and negativity and turning it into something good. My sister Venus once said that when someone out there says you can’t do something, it is because they can’t do it. But I did do it. And so can you.POWER PLAYER

If you watched King Richard, then you know that when I was little, I was not very good at tennis. I was so sad when I didn’t get all the early opportunities that Venus got, but that helped me. It made me work harder, turning me into a savage fighter. I’d travel to tournaments with Venus as her hitting partner, and if there was an open slot, I’d play. I followed her around the world and watched her. When she lost, I understood why, and I made sure I wouldn’t lose the same way. That’s how I started to move so fast up the rankings, because I learned the lessons from Venus’s losses instead of the hard way, from my own. It was as if I were playing her matches, too. I’m a good mimic. Growing up I tried to copy Pete Sampras. I loved Monica Seles, and then I studied Monica Seles. I watched, I listened, then I attacked. But if I hadn’t been in Venus’s shadow, I would never be who I am. When someone said I was just the little sister, that’s when I got really fired up.I started playing tennis with the goal of winning the U.S. Open. I didn’t think past that. And then I just kept winning. I remember when I passed Martina Hingis’s grand slam count. Then Seles’s. And then I tied Billie Jean King, who is such an inspiration for me because of how she has pioneered gender equality in all sports. Then it was climbing over the Chris Evert–Martina Navratilova mountain. There are people who say I’m not the GOAT because I didn’t pass Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam titles, which she achieved before the “open era” that began in 1968. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want that record. Obviously I do. But day to day, I’m really not thinking about her. If I’m in a grand slam final, then yes, I am thinking about that record. Maybe I thought about it too much, and that didn’t help. The way I see it, I should have had 30-plus grand slams. I had my chances after coming back from giving birth. I went from a C-section to a second pulmonary embolism to a grand slam final. I played while breastfeeding. I played through postpartum depression. But I didn’t get there. Shoulda, woulda, coulda. I didn’t show up the way I should have or could have. But I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine. Actually it’s extraordinary. But these days, if I have to choose between building my tennis résumé and building my family, I choose the latter.QUEEN OF THE COURT
Photographed by Annie Leibovitz in Vogue, April 2015. 
Earlier in my career, I never thought about having kids. There were times when I’ve wondered if I should ever bring kids into this world, with all its problems. I was never that confident or comfortable around babies or children, and I figured that if I ever did have a baby, I would have people taking care of it 24/7. I’m not going to lie—I definitely have a lot of support. But I’m also an incredibly hands-on mother. My husband will tell you I am too hands-on. In five years, Olympia has only spent one 24-hour period away from me. This past year, while I was recovering from a hamstring injury, I got to pick her up from school four or five days a week, and I always looked forward to seeing her face light up when she walked out of the building and saw me waiting there for her. The fact is that nothing is a sacrifice for me when it comes to Olympia. It all just makes sense. I want to teach her how to tie her shoes, how to read, where babies come from, and about God. Just like my mom taught me. As she grows, it’s something different every month. Lately she’s been into watching baking shows, which we do together. Now we bake with Play-Doh, which is so much fun. She loves this game called The Floor Is Lava, where you have to do whatever you can to avoid touching the ground. I love setting up my gym for the game, arranging my step-up boxes and weight machines like an obstacle course. Whatever she likes, I like.AT EASE

I think tennis, by comparison, has always felt like a sacrifice—though it’s one I enjoyed making. When you’re younger, you see kids having fun, and you want to do that stuff but you know you have to be on the court, hoping that one day it will all pay off. I got pushed hard by my parents. Nowadays so many parents say, “Let your kids do what they want!” Well, that’s not what got me where I am. I didn’t rebel as a kid. I worked hard, and I followed the rules. I do want to push Olympia—not in tennis, but in whatever captures her interest. But I don’t want to push too hard. I’m still trying to figure out that balance.In my own life, the balance has been slowly shifting toward Serena Ventures. I always say that I’m a sponge: At night I go to bed and I squeeze myself out so that the next day I can take up as much new information as I can. Every morning, I’m so excited to walk downstairs to my office and jump onto Zooms and start reviewing decks of companies we’re considering investing in. We’re a small but growing firm of six people scattered between Florida, where I mainly live, Texas, and California. I started investing nine years ago, and I really fell in love with early stage, whether it’s pre-seed funding, where you’re investing in just an idea, or seed, where the idea has already been turned into a product. I wrote one of the very first checks for MasterClass. It’s one of 16 unicorns—companies valued at more than $1 billion—that Serena Ventures has funded, along with Tonal, Impossible Foods, Noom, and Esusu, to name a few. This year we raised $111 million of outside financing, from banks, private individuals, and family offices. Seventy-​eight percent of our portfolio happens to be companies started by women and people of color, because that’s who we are. On the other hand, my husband is white, and it’s important to me to be inclusive of everyone. Serena Ventures has been an all-female business until recently, when we brought in our first guy—a diversity hire!FEELING GRAND
“I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine. Actually it’s extraordinary.” Wales Bonner dress. Lagos chain necklace. Dezso by Sara Beltran pendant. 
A few years ago, I was at a conference organized by JPMorgan Chase, where I watched a talk between Jamie Dimon and Caryn Seidman-Becker, the CEO of the security company Clear. Caryn explained that less than 2 percent of all VC money went to women. I figured that she misspoke. I thought, There’s no way that 98 percent of that capital is going to men. I approached her afterward, and she confirmed it. I kind of understood then and there that someone who looks like me needs to start writing the big checks. Sometimes like attracts like. Men are writing those big checks to one another, and in order for us to change that, more people who look like me need to be in that position, giving money back to themselves. I’m so grateful to women like Caryn, as well as Sheryl Sandberg and others who have mentored me. It’s important to have women like that who believe in you and push you to think bigger and do bigger.I’d like to think that thanks to me, women athletes can be themselves. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it allIn the last year, Alexis and I have been trying to have another child, and we recently got some information from my doctor that put my mind at ease and made me feel that whenever we’re ready, we can add to our family. I definitely don’t want to be pregnant again as an athlete. I need to be two feet into tennis or two feet out.This spring, I had the itch to get back on the court for the first time in seven months. I was talking to Tiger Woods, who’s a friend, and I told him I needed his advice on my tennis career. I said, “I don’t know what to do: I think I’m over it, but maybe I’m not over it.” He’s Tiger, and he was adamant that I be a beast the same way he is! He said, “Serena, what if you just gave it two weeks? You don’t have to commit to anything. You just go out on the court every day for two weeks and give it your all and see what happens.” I said, “All right, I think I can do that.” And I didn’t do it. But a month later, I gave it a try. And it felt magical to pick up a racket again. And I was good. I was really good. I went back and forth about whether to play Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open after that. As I’ve said, this whole evolution thing has not been easy for me.I don’t particularly like to think about my legacy. I get asked about it a lot, and I never know exactly what to say. But I’d like to think that thanks to opportunities afforded to me, women athletes feel that they can be themselves on the court. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can be strong yet beautiful. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it all. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career. Mistakes are learning experiences, and I embrace those moments. I’m far from perfect, but I’ve also taken a lot of criticism, and I’d like to think that I went through some hard times as a professional tennis player so that the next generation could have it easier. Over the years, I hope that people come to think of me as symbolizing something bigger than tennis. I admire Billie Jean because she transcended her sport. I’d like it to be: Serena is this and she’s that and she was a great tennis player and she won those slams.Unfortunately I wasn’t ready to win Wimbledon this year. And I don’t know if I will be ready to win New York. But I’m going to try. And the lead-up tournaments will be fun. I know there’s a fan fantasy that I might have tied Margaret that day in London, then maybe beat her record in New York, and then at the trophy ceremony say, “See ya!” I get that. It’s a good fantasy. But I’m not looking for some ceremonial, final on-court moment. I’m terrible at goodbyes, the world’s worst. But please know that I am more grateful for you than I can ever express in words. You have carried me to so many wins and so many trophies. I’m going to miss that version of me, that girl who played tennis. And I’m going to miss you. HAPPY DAYS

You think to yourself, "It's a 3-year-old. This should be easy," as you make your way to the court. You know the young girl's name but not much else.But then you see your new pupil walking toward you with her mom -- in her best "tennis mom outfit" -- on a warm Florida fall day and it hits you. Your new student is Olympia Ohanian, the daughter of Serena Williams.Yes, THAT Serena Williams. You know, the greatest tennis player of all time and winner of 23 major singles titles.And that is exactly what happened to an unsuspecting tennis coach on Friday. Williams posted about signing Olympia up for tennis lessons on her Instagram story and mentioned the teacher had no idea who Olympia's mom was going into it. One can only imagine all of the feelings going on for that person today. No pressure, right?Williams tried to get Olympia ready for the lesson by showing her some footage of her own match against Maria Sakkari at the US Open last month. Because she's 3, or perhaps because she watched the match live, Olympia wasn't exactly interested in that or her mom's commentary about speed or stances. Not to mention, she's already an Australian Open champion so she really doesn't need to waste her time watching tape.Olympia was already showing glimpses of her potential on the court earlier this summer with her mom, but now that she's making it official with some lessons, it is pretty much game over for all other tennis players of the 5-and-under variety.

 Community Leader, Rock Hill School District 


			Serena Williams		


The Faces Of / May 6, 2021		



I am originally from Columbia. I moved to Rock Hill in 2001 to build a life with my new husband who landed a math and science Teaching position at Saluda Trail Middle School and enrolled in Graduate School at Winthrop. We were excited to become a part of the Rock Hill community. I am a servant leader with a heart for children and families. I was eager to learn about the community that we would eventually raise a family in so I decided to get involved with City of Rock Hill Human Relations Committee early on. I remember attending the first Martin Luther King Interfaith Prayer Breakfast at Oakland Baptist Church and meeting many community leaders who were very passionate about Dr. King’s legacy, diversity, and inclusion. The experience inspired me to get involved. I have enjoyed serving Rock Hill on a number of boards, committees, and as a member of civic organizations over the past 20 years. Currently, I serve as Chair of The #1 Question Is It Good for Children Initiative, Governance Chair of B.E.L.L. of Rock Hill, Winthrop College of Social Work Advisory Committee, Community Healing Initiative, and Habitat for Humanity Board member. I am also a member of the Rotary Club and Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.

Tell us about your past/current/future career? What do you love most about what you do?
Since 2005, I have been serving as Rock Hill Schools Coordinator of Community Services. I have the pleasure of working with community organizations, agencies, businesses, leaders, and volunteers that provide support for our schools. Prior to my employment with Rock Hill Schools, I worked for York Tech in the Student Services division and Catawba Family Center as a school based mental health therapist. I have always had a passion for working with others to serve the needs of vulnerable students and families. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to spearhead efforts to create and sustain Back the Pack, a nutritional support program that provides meals to students during weekends when school meals are unavailable. This program is made possible by the Rock Hill Schools Education Foundation. It is a sincere joy to work alongside Education Foundation leaders, investors, and community stakeholders to ensure that children in Rock Hill have adequate nutritional support during weekends. It has been a pleasure to be a part of programs and initiatives that have improved quality of life for Rock Hill citizens in housing, recreation, planning, development and more. I received the distinguished 2021 Martin Luther King Dream Keeper award and was named a CN2 Hometown Hero. I am honored to utilize my platform to advance local diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts by working with members of The Rock Hill Healing Initiative and serving on Rock Hill Schools Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Task Force.
Tell us a little about your family. Pets too!
I am married to Dr. Norris Williams. We have two sons Norris, 16 year old junior who attends Nortwestern and Noble, 10 year old 5th grader at Sunset Park Center for Accelerated Studies. Norris and Noble swim on local swim teams. We enjoy cheering the boys on at their swim meets, dining out, traveling and watching movies.
What is your favorite restaurant in Rock Hill, and what do you love there
The Pump House. Their cornbread muffins and okra are delightful.
How long have you lived or worked in Rock Hill?
20 years
If you could travel anywhere in the world right now, where would it be? And why?
Hawaii. It’s a beautiful place to go on a vacation. I prefer to stay within the United States while we are under global pandemic restrictions.
If you could give anyone a piece of advice, what would it be and to whom?
Up and coming professionals: Lead with your heart. Care about others. Kindness is contagious!
What is something on your bucket list OR what is your favorite bucket list item you’ve achieved to date?

Serena Williams, is one of the top female tennis player in the world, has always maintained a level of interest.

Biography
Serena Williams, is one of the top female tennis player in the world, has always maintained a level of interest. She earned her first grand slam singles title at the U.S. Open back in 1999, and made a string of four straight grand slam singles title wins - the 2002 French, Wimbledon, and U.S. Open titles, and the 2003 Australian Open title, all achieved by defeating her older sister, Venus. A knee injury in 2003 forced her to sit out 8 months of tennis competition. She reached the Wimbledon final in 2004, but has not won a major title since the summer of 2003. As of late, Serena has taken a stab at acting, appearing in guest roles on both Simpsons (1989) and My Wife and Kids (2001).

17 Things You Didn’t Know About Serena Williams
Girlboss

















Serena Williams is one of the greatest tennis players of all time, and that’s only one of the many cool things about her. There’s more Serena Williams facts worth knowing.
You may already be aware that she has won 308 grand slams and four Olympic gold medals (NBD). And unless you’ve been living off the grid for the past month, you probably also know she just had a baby girl with her husband and Reddit co-founder, Alex Ohanian.
But as amazing as Serena is as both a mother and a tennis player, she’s just an incredible all-around human being. So, in honor of the champion’s 36th birthday, here are 17 additional Serena Williams facts to brush up on.
1. Serena’s favorite city is Rome.
Which makes her meet-cute with now-husband Alex Ohanian even cuter. (The couple reportedly met at the Hotel Cavalieri Hilton in Rome back in 2015.)
2. Tigers and dogs are Serena’s favorite animals.
And she’s mom to an adorable Yorkshire terrier named Chip.

3. The song that Serena is most embarrassed to have stored in her iPhone is “MMMBop” by Hanson, according to espnW.
OMG, same.
4. The oddest thing in Serena’s gym bag is apparently OPI nail polish.
Which makes sense, considering she has her own OPI line.

5. Serena’s middle name is Jameka.
“Queen Serena Jameka Williams” has a nice ring to it, no?
6. The tennis star’s go-to gadget in the kitchen is her toaster oven.
7. Serena’s been playing tennis since she was three years old.
Suffice it to say, she got those 10,000 hours of practice in.

8. Her favorite author is Maya Angelou.
9. Along with Alicia Keys, Kerry Washington, and Kanye West, Serena Williams appeared in Common’s music video back in 2007.
Serena and the rapper were reportedly dating at the time.







10. Serena was born in Saginaw, Michigan.
11. Her favorite color is purple, according to Boomsbeat.
And purple’s favorite is Serena.

12. She lives with her family in Palm Beach, Florida.
13. Two of Serena’s favorite singers are Mariah Carey and Brandy.
According to Venus and Serena Williams: A Biography.
14. Serena and her mom are Jehovah’s Witnesses, they’ve held this faith since the early ’80s.
15. Serena speaks French fluently, and she’s been known to conduct on-court interviews in French whenever she plays matches in France.
Comment dit-on “badass” en Française?

16. Serena helped build a school in Uganda.
Plus, her non-profit, the Serena Williams Fund, has funded schools in Jamaica, Kenya, and Uganda.

17. Serena’s dabbled in acting over the years, appearing in shows like Drop Dead Diva and Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.

Serena Jameka Williams (born September 26, 1981)[1] is an American inactive professional tennis player. Considered among the greatest tennis players of all time,[a] she was ranked world No. 1 in singles by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) for 319 weeks, including a joint-record 186 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. She won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, the most by any player in the Open Era, and the second-most of all time. She is the only player, male or female, to accomplish a Career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles.[19]
Along with her older sister Venus, Serena Williams was coached by her parents Oracene Price and Richard Williams. Turning professional in 1995, she won her first major singles title at the 1999 US Open. From the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open, she was dominant, winning all four major singles titles (each time over Venus in the final) to achieve a non-calendar year Grand Slam and the career Grand Slam, known as the 'Serena Slam'. The next few years saw her claim two more singles majors, but suffer from injury and decline in form. Beginning in 2007, however, she gradually returned to form despite continued injuries, retaking the world No. 1 singles ranking. Beginning at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, Williams returned to dominance, claiming Olympic gold (completing the Career Golden Slam in singles)[20] and winning eight out of thirteen singles majors, including all four in a row from 2014–15 to achieve a second "Serena Slam". At the 2017 Australian Open, she won her 23rd major singles title, surpassing Steffi Graf's Open Era record. She then took a break from professional tennis after becoming pregnant and reached four major finals upon returning to play. In August 2022, Williams announced her impending "evolution" away from professional tennis and played what was expected to be her final match at the 2022 US Open.[21]
Williams also won 14 major women's doubles titles, all with her sister Venus, and the pair was unbeaten in major doubles finals (the best unbeaten record in major finals in any discipline of the sport).[22][23] The pair achieved a non-calendar year Grand Slam between the 2009 Wimbledon Championships and the 2010 French Open, which granted the sisters the doubles world No. 1 ranking. Serena won four Olympic gold medals, three in women's doubles—an all-time joint record in tennis, shared with her sister.[24][25] The duo are the only women in the Open Era to win Olympic gold in both singles and doubles.[26] She also won two major mixed doubles titles, both in 1998. She is the only singles player, male or female, to complete three Career Golden Slams – one in women's singles and two in same-sex doubles.[19]
The arrival of the Williams sisters has been credited with ushering in a new era of power and athleticism on the women's professional tennis tour.[27][28][29][30] Serena holds a combined 39 major titles: 23 in singles, 14 in women's doubles, and two in mixed doubles. She is joint-third on the all-time list and second in the Open Era for total major titles. She is the most recent woman to simultaneously hold all four major singles titles (2002–03 and 2014–15), and the most recent woman to win the Surface Slam (major titles on hard, clay and grass courts in the same calendar year), doing so in 2015. She is also, with Venus, the most recent player to have simultaneously held all four major women's doubles titles (2009–10).
Williams was the world's highest paid woman athlete in 2016, earning almost $29 million.[31] She repeated this feat in 2017 when she was the only woman on Forbes' list of the 100 highest-paid athletes, with $27 million in prize money and endorsements. She won the Laureus Sportswoman of the Year award a record four times (2003, 2010, 2016, 2018), and in December 2015 was named Sportsperson of the Year by Sports Illustrated magazine.[32] She is the highest-earning woman athlete of all time.[33]


Early life
Williams was born on September 26, 1981, in Saginaw, Michigan to Oracene Price and Richard Williams. She is the youngest of Price's five daughters: half-sisters Yetunde, Lyndrea, and Isha Price, and full older sister Venus.[1] She also has at least seven paternal half-siblings.[34][35] When the children were young, the family moved to Compton, California, where she started playing tennis at age four.[36][37] Her father home-schooled her and her sister, Venus.[38][39] While he and subsequently her mother have been their official coaches, her other mentors have included Richard Williams, a Compton man who shared her father's name and subsequently founded The Venus and Serena Williams Tennis Tutorial Academy.[40]

 Williams sisters at a Pam Shriver event in Baltimore, 1993
When Williams was nine, she and her family moved from Compton to West Palm Beach, Florida[36] so she could attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci, who provided her with additional coaching. Macci did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls".[41] Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, as he wanted them to "go slowly" and focus on school work. Experiences of racism also influenced this decision, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments.[42] At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida.[43] In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether it would have been more beneficial for them to have followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit, Williams responded, "Everyone does different things. I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us."[43]



Professional career
1995–1998: Professional debut
Williams' parents wanted their daughter to wait until she was 16 to participate in professional tournaments.[44] In 1995, just after turning 14, Williams planned to make her professional debut as a wild-card entry in the Bank of the West Classic in Oakland, California, but was denied by the WTA owing to their age-eligibility restrictions.[45] She subsequently filed an antitrust lawsuit against the women's tour, but withdrew it at her parents' request.[45] Her first professional event was in October 1995 at the Bell Challenge in Quebec,[44][46] where she used a wild-card entry to circumvent age-eligibility rules.[44] She lost in the first qualifying round to then 18-year-old American Annie Miller, winning just two games.[47]
Williams did not play a tournament in 1996. The next year, she lost in the qualifying rounds of three tournaments,[48] before winning her first main-draw match in November at the Ameritech Cup Chicago.[49] Ranked No. 304, she upset No. 7 Mary Pierce, and No. 4 Monica Seles,[50][51] recording her first career wins over top 10 players and becoming the lowest-ranked player in the Open Era to defeat two top-10 opponents in one tournament.[1] She ultimately lost in the semifinals to No. 5 Lindsay Davenport.[52] She finished 1997 ranked No. 99.[53]
Williams began 1998 at the Medibank International Sydney.[54] As a qualifier ranked No. 96,[55] she defeated No. 3 Davenport in the quarterfinals,[55] before losing to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in the semifinals.[56] Williams made her debut in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament at the Australian Open,[57] where she defeated sixth-seeded Irina Spîrlea in the first round,[58] before losing to her sister, Venus, in the second round in the sisters' first professional match.[58][54] She reached six other quarterfinals during the year, but lost all of them,[59] including her first match against No. 1-ranked Martina Hingis at the Lipton International Players Championships in Key Biscayne,[60] and her second match against Venus at the Italian Open in Rome.[59] She failed to reach the quarterfinals of any Grand Slam tournament the remainder of the year,[citation needed] losing in the fourth round of the French Open to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario,[61] and the third round of the US Open to Spîrlea.[62] She withdrew from Wimbledon two games into a match with Virginia Ruano Pascual, after straining a calf muscle during the first set.[63] She did win the mixed doubles titles at Wimbledon and the US Open with Max Mirnyi, completing the Williams family's sweep of the 1998 mixed doubles Grand Slam tournaments. She won her first professional title in doubles at the U.S. National Indoor Championships in Oklahoma City with Venus, becoming the third pair of sisters to win a WTA title.[1] They won two more doubles titles that year. Williams finished the year ranked No. 20 in singles.[citation needed]

Battle of the sexes: Karsten Braasch vs. the Williams sisters
Main article: Battle of the Sexes (tennis)
A 16-year-old Serena and her sister Venus competed in a tennis "Battle of the Sexes" against Karsten Braasch at the 1998 Australian Open.[64] At the time Braasch was 203rd in the ATP rankings. The sisters had claimed they could beat any man outside the top 200, and accepted his challenge. Braasch beat both of them, playing one set against each. The score versus Serena was 6–1 and 6–2 against Venus.[65] Braasch said afterward, "500 and above, no chance." The sisters later tweaked the number to beating men outside the top 350.[66]

1999–2001: Becoming a top-10 player
Williams lost in the third round of the 1999 Australian Open to Sandrine Testud. A month later, Williams won her first professional singles title when she defeated Amélie Mauresmo in the final of the Open Gaz de France in Paris. With Venus also winning the IGA Superthrift Classic in Memphis, Tennessee, that day, the pair became the first sisters to win professional tournaments in the same week.[67] In March of that year, at the Evert Cup in California, Williams won her first Tier I title, defeating Steffi Graf in the final. Soon afterward at the Miami Masters, Williams had her 16-match winning streak ended by her sister in the first all-sister singles final in WTA history,[54] and she then made her top-10 debut, at No. 9. She then lost in the quarterfinals of the Italian Open[68] and the German Open,[69] and the third round of the French Open,[70] where she and Venus won the women's doubles title.[54] Williams then missed Wimbledon because of injury. When she returned to the tour, Williams won a Fed Cup singles match and then won the JPMorgan Chase Open in Los Angeles, beating Julie Halard-Decugis in the final. She then defeated in succession Grand Slam champions Kim Clijsters, Conchita Martínez, Monica Seles, and defending champion Lindsay Davenport to reach the US Open final, where she defeated No. 1, Hingis, to become the second African-American woman, after Althea Gibson in 1958, to win a Grand Slam singles tournament.[1] The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at this tournament. To complete her 1999 season, Williams won a doubles match in the Fed Cup final against Russia. Williams ended the year ranked No. 4 in just her second full year on the main tour.[71]
Williams started 2000 by losing in the fourth round of the Australian Open to Elena Likhovtseva. She failed to defend her titles in Paris and Indian Wells, although she did win the Faber Grand Prix in Germany. Soon afterwards, Williams missed the French Open because of injury. She returned from injury at the Wimbledon Championships, where she lost to Venus in the semifinals, but the pair won the doubles title at the event. Williams successfully defended her title in Los Angeles, defeating Davenport in the final. She reached the final of the Du Maurier Open where an injury forced her to retire from her match with Hingis. Her defense of the US Open title ended when she lost in the quarterfinals to Davenport. Williams teamed with Venus to win the gold medal in doubles at the Sydney Olympics that September. She ended the year winning the Toyota Princess Cup in Japan and she finished the year ranked No. 6.[citation needed]
Williams began 2001 losing to Martina Hingis in the quarterfinals of the Medibank International in Sydney and the Australian Open in Melbourne. Williams and her sister won the doubles title at the latter tournament, becoming only the fifth doubles team in history to win all four Grand Slam women's doubles titles during their career, completing a "Career Grand Slam". Her next event was the Pacific Life Open in California, where she defeated Kim Clijsters in the final. The final was marred by the behavior of the crowd toward Williams and her family. Crowd members were incensed at the perceived match-fixing of games involving the family after Venus withdrew before their semifinal. Neither Williams nor her sister entered the tournament for fourteen years until Williams entered in 2015 as a wildcard (and the top seed).[72] The following week at the Ericsson Open in Miami, Williams lost to Jennifer Capriati in the quarterfinals. She then lost in the quarterfinals to Capriati at both the French Open and Wimbledon Championships. That was the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament at which Williams had exited in the quarterfinals. During the North American hard-court season, she lost in the quarterfinals of Los Angeles against Monica Seles, then captured her second title of the year at the Rogers Cup, defeating Capriati in the final. Williams reached the final of the 2001 US Open, losing to sister Venus. That was the first Grand Slam tournament final contested by two sisters during the Open Era. At the 2001 season-ending Tour Championships, Williams won the championship by walkover when Davenport withdrew before the start of the final because of a knee injury. Williams finished 2001 at No. 6 for the second straight year.[citation needed]

2002–2003: "Serena Slam"
Early 2002, injury saw Williams retire from the semifinal at the Medibank International Sydney and later withdraw from the Australian Open.[73]  Playing Amélie Mauresmo in the quarterfinals of the tournament in Sydney in 2002
Returning from injury, Williams won her first title of the year in Scottsdale, Arizona, defeating No. 2 Jennifer Capriati, in the final. She then won the Miami Masters for the first time, becoming one of three players in the Open Era to defeat the world's top 3 ranked players at one tournament,[1] after beating No. 3, Martina Hingis, in the quarterfinals, No. 2 Venus in the semifinals, and the top-ranked player, Capriati, in the final. Serena's straight set win over Venus was her second career win over her sister.[citation needed]
Williams played three clay-court tournaments before the 2002 French Open. Her first tournament was at Charleston, where she was the third seed. Williams reached the quarterfinals before losing to Patty Schnyder. She reached her first clay-court final in May, at the Eurocard German Open losing to Justine Henin in a third set tiebreak. Williams went on to win her first clay court title at the Italian Open, defeating Capriati in the semifinals and Henin in the final.[74] This raised her ranking to a new high of No. 3. Williams was the third seed at the French Open at Roland Garros, where she claimed her first title thereby defeating defending champion Capriati in the semifinals and sister Venus in the final to win her second Grand Slam tournament title (and her first in two-and-a-half years). As a result of raising the trophy at Court Philippe Chatrier, Williams rose to a career-high of No. 2, second only to Venus.[citation needed]
At the 2002 Wimbledon Championships, Williams won tennis's oldest championship for the first time in her life, defeating Venus to win a Grand Slam singles title without dropping a set for the first time in her career. This victory earned Williams the world No. 1 ranking for the first time, dethroning her sister and becoming only the third African American woman to hold that ranking.[1] The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at the tournament, the fifth Grand Slam doubles title for the pair. Williams played just one tournament between Wimbledon and the US Open, losing in the quarterfinals of the JPMorgan Chase Open in Los Angeles to American Chanda Rubin and ending a 21-match winning streak. The top-seeded player at the US Open, Williams reached the final where, for the third Grand Slam in a row, she defeated her sister to win the title, the second US Open crown of her career. Williams won two consecutive singles titles in the fall, defeating Kim Clijsters to win the Toyota Princess Cup in Tokyo, and Anastasia Myskina to win the Sparkassen Cup in Leipzig, Germany. She reached the final at the year-end Home Depot Championships at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, where she lost to fifth-seeded Clijsters in straight sets, ending an 18-match winning streak.[citation needed]
Williams finished 2002 with a 56–5 W/L record, eight singles titles, and the No. 1 ranking. She was the first African-American to end a year with that ranking since Althea Gibson in 1958[citation needed] and was the first woman to win three Grand Slam tournament titles in one year since Hingis in 1997.[1] Her three consecutive Grand Slam titles to close 2002 also made Williams only the third player in tennis history to win the "Surface Slam",[75] three Slam titles on three surfaces in the same calendar year, after Navratilova (1984) and Graf (1993, 1995, 1996).[citation needed]
At the 2003 Australian Open, Williams reached the tournament's semifinals for the first time, where she recovered from 5–1 down in the third set and saved two match points before defeating Clijsters. In the final, Serena faced Venus for the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament final, defeating her older sister to become the sixth woman in the Open Era to complete a career Grand Slam, alongside Margaret Court, Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Steffi Graf. She also became the fifth woman to hold all Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously, joining Maureen Connolly Brinker, Court, Graf, and Navratilova. This feat was dubbed the "Serena Slam" by the press.[76][77] The Williams sisters won their sixth Grand Slam doubles title together at this event.[78]
During the spring of 2003, Williams captured the singles titles at the Open Gaz de France and the Sony Ericsson Open. Williams's winning streak came to an end when she lost the final of the Family Circle Cup to Henin, her first loss of the year after 21 wins. She also lost to Mauresmo in the semifinals of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome. Despite these losses, Williams was the top seed at the French Open, where she lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Henin, marking Williams's first loss in a Grand Slam tournament since 2001. The match was controversial, as Williams questioned Henin's sportsmanship, and spectators applauded Williams's errors.[79] Williams rebounded from the French Open loss a couple weeks later at the 2003 Wimbledon Championships, defeating Henin in the semifinals and Venus in the final. This was Williams's second consecutive Wimbledon title and her sixth Grand Slam singles title overall. Wimbledon was Williams's last tournament of 2003; she pulled out of three events in the US and then underwent surgery on the quadriceps tendon in her knee in early August. Williams was initially expected to be out for six to eight weeks.[80]

2004–2007: Injuries and the comeback
Main articles: 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 Serena Williams tennis season
After eight months away from the tour, during which time her desire was questioned,[81] Williams began her comeback at the 2004 NASDAQ-100 Open in Miami in March, where she made a triumphant return as she won the title for the third consecutive year. Delivering a serve at an exhibition in November 2004
Although ranked No. 7, Williams was seeded second at the French Open, where, after winning four matches, she lost to Capriati in the quarterfinals. That was the first time that Williams had lost before the semifinals at a Grand Slam singles tournament since Wimbledon in 2001. A few weeks later, even though her ranking had dropped to No. 10, Williams was seeded first at Wimbledon. She won six matches en route to the final, where 13th-seeded Maria Sharapova defeated her in straight sets. This loss caused her ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the first time since 1999. Later that summer, Williams reached her third final of the year at the JPMorgan Chase Open in Los Angeles where she lost to Lindsay Davenport which was her first loss to the American since the 2000 US Open. After missing her national championship in 2003, Williams returned for the 2004 US Open, where she was seeded third despite her No. 11 ranking. She lost in the U.S. Open quarterfinals to Capriati in three sets in controversial fashion.[82] That fall, Williams won her second title of the year, at the China Open, defeating US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the final.

In the final, Williams defeated top seed Davenport to win her second Australian Open and seventh Grand Slam singles title, winning 12 of the last 15 games.[85] The win moved Williams back to No. 2 but stated she was targeting the top spot.[86]

At the US Open, Williams lost to her sister Venus in the fourth round. This was the earliest the sisters had met in a Grand Slam tournament since their first meeting, at the 1998 Australian Open. Williams played just one more match that fall, a loss to No. 127 Sun Tiantian at the tournament in Beijing. She failed to qualify for the year-end championship for the first time since 1998 and she finished the year 2005 ranked No. 11, her first time finishing the season outside the top 10 since 1998.[citation needed]
Williams made her 2006 debut at the Australian Open. Defending the title, Williams lost to Daniela Hantuchová in the third round.[90] After the tournament, she told the press that she was injured, blaming a lack of fitness and a knee injury for keeping her off the court.[91] In her biography, Williams claims that she was actually suffering from depression. She stayed away from pro tennis for six months during the 2006 season. After she had shut herself off from the world for a period, Williams saw a therapist daily.[92] After a chance meeting with a young girl who idolized Williams and believed that she could still win, Williams signed up to play in Cincinnati,[93] her first tournament since Melbourne. Williams had slipped to No. 139, the lowest ranking she had held since 1997. On her return, Williams defeated Myskina and Bethanie Mattek,[94][95] before losing in the semifinals to Vera Zvonareva.[96] She also reached the semifinals in Los Angeles, losing to Janković in straight sets.

Williams lost in the quarterfinals of the Hobart International, a warm-up for the Australian Open where Williams was unseeded because of her No. 81 ranking and was widely regarded as "out of shape".[101] She experienced a huge amount of pressure on herself before the tournament, coming from her fans and the press as well as Williams herself about her weight, focus and needing a good showing.[citation needed]
Shortly before her first match, a representative from Nike paid her a visit in the players' lounge, informing her that if she did not perform to her accustomed level, the company might drop her. Williams claimed that Nike's ultimatum meant that she would have to reach the quarterfinals at least.[102]
The distraction from Nike did not distract Williams, as she lost just three games to Mara Santangelo and defeated Anne Kremer in straight sets.[103] By this point, a blister had developed on Williams's foot and she had contracted a cold. In the third round, Williams found herself two points away from going home against Nadia Petrova, but fought back to win in three sets, which was her first win over a top-10 player since defeating Lindsay Davenport in the 2005 Australian Open final. Williams then made it to the final, defeating Janković, Pe'er and Vaidišová. Williams described them as "good players. Strong players. Players who certainly didn't expect an overweight, out-of-shape, has been champion like me to give them a game."[104] Williams also found herself two points from going out against Peer before turning it around.[105] By the time Williams had reached the final, the cold and blister had both left. Previewing the finals, Tracy Austin stated that, although Williams had a great tournament, she believed that the ride was over and that Sharapova would have no trouble with Williams. Williams thought it was mean and unnecessary and used it as motivation along with other criticism.[106] In the final, Williams lost just three games against Maria Sharapova, winning her first title at any tournament since winning the 2005 Australian Open 24 months prior.[105] Williams became the first player since Chris O'Neil to win the title while not being seeded, and claimed her third Australian Open and eighth Grand Slam singles title overall. The win elevated Williams to 14th in the rankings. Williams dedicated the title to her deceased half-sister Yetunde.[107] Her performance in the final was described in the press as "one of the best performances of her career" and "arguably the most powerful display ever seen in women's tennis".[101][108] In her post-match interview, Williams took a swipe at her critics, stating that she had proved them wrong.[109] Williams won the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami for the fourth time by defeating Justine Henin. Williams had to record a come-from-behind win after being whitewashed in the first set and saving two match points in the second.[110] She played for her country in the Fed Cup for the first time since 2003 in a tie against Belgium, and won her opening match[111] but withdrew from her second, because of a knee injury.[112]
At the French Open, Williams lost in the quarterfinals to Henin.[113] During her fourth round match against Hantuchová at Wimbledon, Williams collapsed from an acute muscle spasm at 5–5 in the second set. After a medical timeout and holding serve to force a tiebreak, rain forced play to be suspended for nearly two hours. When the players returned, Williams won the match in three sets.[114] Williams then lost her quarterfinal match with Henin, whilst suffering from the injuries sustained in the previous round.[115] At the US Open, Williams lost her third consecutive Grand Slam singles quarterfinal to Henin.[116] Williams reached the final of Kremlin Cup, losing to Elena Dementieva.

After the match, Martina Navratilova said that Williams is in the top five of all the women's tennis players in all of history, which she said that "it's not just about how many Slams you win or how many tournaments you win—it's just your game overall. And she's got all the goods."[129] Serena was the defending champion in doubles with her sister Venus, winning the last two years. They lost in the quarterfinals to Elena Vesnina and Zvonareva.

2014–2015: Second 'Serena Slam'
Main articles: 2014 and 2015 Serena Williams tennis season
Williams defended her title at the Brisbane International by defeating No. 2, Victoria Azarenka, in the final.[165] At the Australian Open she ended up losing to former No. 1, Ana Ivanovic, in the fourth round.

Serena was then forced to withdraw from the doubles event alongside sister Venus while trailing 0–3 in the second round. A disoriented Serena hit 4 consecutive doubles faults and was having trouble with both her ball toss and movement before being removed from what has been described as one of the most unusual scenes ever seen in tennis.[168][169]
Williams rebounded by winning 19 out of her next 20 matches (losing only to sister Venus in the semifinals of the Rogers Cup). This streak include titles at the Bank of the West Classic as well as her first Western & Southern Open title and her third consecutive and sixth overall US Open singles title which she won without having dropped a set.[170][171] With this victory Williams tied Chris Evert for most singles titles won by a woman at the US Open in the Open Era. Williams also tied Evert and Navratilova's 18 Grand Slam singles titles won in the Open Era. By virtue of having won both the US Open and the US Open Series, Williams collected $4,000,000 – the biggest payday in tennis history. At the Wuhan Open a viral illness forced her to retire while up a break in the first set against Alizé Cornet. Cornet thus became the first woman since Justine Henin in 2007 to record three victories over Williams in one year. At the China Open Williams retired prior to her quarterfinal match versus Samantha Stosur. At the 2014 WTA Finals in Singapore Williams advanced to the final for the third consecutive year despite having equaled her career-worst loss in her second round robin match versus Simona Halep.[172] Williams won her fifth WTA Finals title by avenging her loss to Halep in the championship match for her seventh title of the year.[173] Williams finished the year ranked No. 1 for the fourth time in her career. She held the No. 1 ranking for the entire calendar year, a feat not accomplished since Steffi Graf in 1996. She was also voted WTA Player of the Year and ITF World Champion for a third consecutive year (sixth overall).[citation needed]
Williams began the 2015 season by representing the United States alongside John Isner at the Hopman Cup. The American pair lost the final to the Poland.[174] At the Australian Open Williams defeated Maria Sharapova for the 16th consecutive time to claim her 6th Australian Open singles title and 19th career Grand Slam singles title, winning the title on her third match point in the second set.[175][176][177][178][179] With this victory Williams surpassed both, Evert and Navratilova, for second most Grand Slam singles titles won in the Open Era. The title was also her sixth Grand Slam singles title since turning 30 years of age, three more than the next closest to do so (Margaret Court, Martina Navratilova with three each). She is the only player in history to win all four Grand Slams at least once after having turned 30. The following weekend, Serena and sister Venus traveled to Buenos Aires to face Argentina in a World Group II tie for Fed Cup. She played and won her only match against María Irigoyen to help Team USA to a 4–1 win over Argentina.[180] Williams announced that she would be competing at the Indian Wells Masters ending her 14-year boycott of the event.[181][182] Upon her return Williams received a standing ovation from the crowd and won her first match in straight sets.[183] She reached the semifinals, where she was due to face No. 3, Simona Halep, for a place in the final, but was forced to withdraw because of a knee injury. By virtue of having defeated Sabine Lisicki in the quarterfinals of the Miami Open, Williams became only the eighth woman in the Open Era to record 700 match wins in her career.[184] This also made her one of only three active players to have won 700 or more matches in singles, others being Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.[185] In the semifinals she won against Halep to advance to her tenth final at the event[186] where she won a record eighth title and extended her winning streak to 21 by beating Carla Suárez Navarro.[187][188][189]

 Williams celebrating her third French Open title
As preparation for the clay court season (and to ensure her eligibility for the 2016 Summer Olympics), Williams travelled to Brindisi, Italy, to face Italy's team for a place in the Fed Cup's World Group. Williams lost the decisive doubles match alongside Alison Riske to Sara Errani and Flavia Pennetta, and as a result the United States team were relegated to World Group II. It was Williams's first loss in the Fed Cup.[190] She maintained her perfect record in singles by defeating Camila Giorgi and Errani. The week of April 20 marked Williams's 114th consecutive week ranked No. 1, the third-longest run in WTA history, behind Steffi Graf's 186 weeks and Navratilova's 156.[citation needed] Williams suffered her first defeat of the season in the semifinals of the Mutua Madrid Open to No. 4, Petra Kvitová.[191][192] This loss ended a 27-match winning streak for Williams as well as a 50-match winning streak at Premier-Mandatory events, and also a 19-match winning streak at the particular event.[193] Williams played one match at the 2015 Internazionali BNL d'Italia before withdrawing from the tournament with an elbow injury.[194]
By virtue of having defeated Victoria Azarenka in the third round of the French Open, Williams became the first woman in the Open Era to win 50 matches at all four of the Grand Slams.[195] Williams then defeated Sloane Stephens to reach her 40th Grand Slam singles quarterfinal.[196] Williams won her next match easily, but had to come back from a set down in the semifinals versus Timea Bacsinszky for the fourth time in five matches to reach the final.[197][198] She would go on to defeat Lucie Šafářová from the Czech Republic in three sets to win her third French Open and 20th Grand Slam singles title.[199][200][201]
The win made Williams only the third person in history to win each Grand Slam at least three times, joining Margaret Court and Steffi Graf. She is the first player to win three straight Grand Slams since she did it herself during the Serena Slam. She also became the first player to win the Australian-French Open double since Jennifer Capriati in 2001.[202]
Williams completed her second "Serena Slam" (winning all four Grand Slams in a row) by winning the 2015 Wimbledon Championships – her 6th Wimbledon and 21st Grand Slam singles title overall.[203][204] Her path to victory at Wimbledon was particularly challenging. She was down a double break in the third round versus Heather Watson and two points from defeat twice before rallying for the win[205] and becoming the first player to qualify for the WTA Finals[206] (the earliest that a player had qualified since the event switched to the round-robin format in 2003). Williams then defeated three former No. 1 players–Venus Williams, Victoria Azarenka and Maria Sharapova—in succession to advance to the final.[207] Awaiting her there was 21-year-old Garbiñe Muguruza, who had previously handed Williams the worst Grand Slam tournament defeat of her career at the 2014 French Open.[208] Williams defeated Muguruza in a tight two-setter.[citation needed]
The victory made Williams the oldest woman in the Open Era to win a grand slam singles title, in addition to having the distinction of being the oldest ladies' grand slam singles champion of all time.[209] It also was her eighth consecutive victory in Grand Slam singles finals appearances, breaking Steffi Graf's Open Era record of seven from 1995 through 1999 and, on the men's side, tying Pete Sampras's Open Era record of eight from 1995 through 2000. Her 21st Grand Slam singles titles equaled the tally of the rest of the women's tour, combined.[210] The week of July 13 marked the first time in WTA history that the No. 1 player had more than twice as many points as No. 2.[211] Following her win at Wimbledon, Williams was awarded her 7th ESPY for Best Female Tennis Player.[212]
Williams played one match at the Swedish Open in Båstad before withdrawing with an elbow injury.[213] She was the defending champion at the Bank of the West Classic but withdrew from the tournament in order for her elbow to get better.[214] Williams had her 19 match winning streak ended by 18-year-old Swiss Belinda Bencic, the No. 20, in three tight sets in the semifinals of the Canadian Open.[215][216] It was her second defeat of the year and first on hard courts since the 2014 WTA Finals. The next week Williams defended her title at the Western & Southern Open with a straight sets victory over No. 3 Simona Halep for her 69th WTA title, breaking a tie with Evonne Goolagong for standalone fifth-most WTA titles won.[217][218] Williams's attempt at capturing the "Grand Slam" (winning all four Grand Slams in a calendar year) came to an end in the semifinals of the US Open, where she lost to Roberta Vinci in three sets.[219][220][221] The loss has been described by some as one of the biggest upsets in tennis history.[222][223][224] Nonetheless, Williams secured the year-end No. 1 ranking with her results at the tournament.[225] On October 1, Williams called an end to her season, stating that she had been injured for most of the year and wanted to address her fitness issues.[226] Prior to the announcement, coach Patrick Mouratoglou hinted that Williams might not play again in 2015 owing to a lack of motivation and disappointment following her loss at the Open.[227] On October 5, Williams surpassed Chris Evert for third-most weeks ranked world No. 1.[228] Williams held the No. 1 ranking the entire season for the second consecutive year, finishing there for the fifth time in her career. She was voted WTA Player of the Year for the seventh time in her career.[229] On December 14, Sports Illustrated announced Williams as their Sportsperson of the Year.[230] She thus became the third solo woman, and first since 1983, to receive the award.[231] Williams was also named ITF World Champion for the sixth time in her career.[232] Soon after, it was announced that she was voted Female Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press for the fourth time.[233]

2016: Open Era Grand Slam record
Main article: 2016 Serena Williams tennis season
Williams withdrew from the Hopman Cup after retiring from her singles match against Australia Gold with inflammation of her left knee.[234] Her next tournament was the Australian Open, where she was the No. 1 seed and defending champion. She reached the final without dropping a set, including wins over No. 5, Maria Sharapova, and No. 4, Agnieszka Radwańska, and faced first time Grand Slam finalist Angelique Kerber. She was considered the heavy favorite to win the title, as she had never lost an Australian Open final or semifinal. She also dominated the head-to-head against Kerber, having lost only once in six meetings and having not lost a set to her in four years. Williams lost the final in three sets and Kerber won her first Grand Slam title.[235] This marked Williams's first-ever loss in the final of the Australian Open, as well as her first three-set loss in the final of a Grand Slam.[236] She had previously been 6–0 and 8–0 respectively.
The week of February 15 marked Williams's 157th consecutive week ranked No. 1, passing Navratilova's mark of 156 to have the second-longest run in WTA history behind Steffi Graf's 186. She competed in Indian Wells as the No. 1 seed. She reached her first final here since winning in 2001 and before boycotting the event, by defeating Simona Halep in the quarterfinals and Agnieszka Radwańska in the semifinals. She did not drop a set en route to the final. Williams was upset by No. 13 seed Victoria Azarenka, whom she had defeated the last five times the pair had met, in straight sets. This marked the first time since 2004 where Williams lost two consecutive finals. She next played the Miami Open as the defending champion. She lost in the fourth round to Svetlana Kuznetsova. This marked her first loss here since 2012 and ended her 20 match winning streak in Miami. This was also her earliest exit here since 2000, where she lost in the same round. During the clay court swing, Williams withdrew from Madrid but entered Rome. She beat Anna-Lena Friedsam and Christina McHale to progress to the quarterfinals where she defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova to avenge her loss in Miami. She then went on to beat Irina-Camelia Begu and Madison Keys to win her 70th career WTA title and to win her first title of the year. This was her third Rome title in four years and fourth overall.[citation needed]
At the French Open, Williams dropped only one set en route to the final. She defeated Yulia Putintseva in the quarterfinals despite being five points away from losing. She then beat surprise semifinalist Kiki Bertens to reach her fourth French Open final where she faced Garbiñe Muguruza in a repeat of last year's Wimbledon final where Williams was victorious. The result was not the same as that Wimbledon final as Williams lost to Muguruza in straight sets. With this loss, Williams had lost two consecutive Grand Slam finals for the first time in her career. On top of failing to equal Steffi Graf's Open Era record of 22 Grand Slam singles titles, Williams also completed the Career Grand Slam runner-up set with this loss.[citation needed]
At Wimbledon, Williams only lost one set en route to the final where she faced Angelique Kerber in a rematch of their Australian Open final earlier in the year. This time, Williams defeated Kerber in straight sets to finally equal Steffi Graf's record of 22 Grand Slams in the Open Era. That was Williams's first Grand Slam title of the year, as well as her 71st career WTA title overall. In what was a brilliant serving performance, Williams only faced one break point in the whole match against Kerber which she saved with an ace. Later that day, Williams partnered with sister Venus to win their sixth Wimbledon doubles title and 14th doubles Grand Slam title overall, keeping their perfect record at Grand Slam doubles finals intact. On July 24, 2016, Williams withdrew from Rogers Cup citing a shoulder inflammation injury.[237] She next participated in the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where she was the defending gold medalist in both singles and doubles and was the heavy favourite to retain those titles. Partnering with her sister Venus in the doubles, they suffered a shock exit in the first round, losing to the Czech duo of Lucie Šafářová and Barbora Strýcová, which ended their career record of 15–0 dating back to the 2000 Olympics.[238] In singles, after defeating Daria Gavrilova and Alizé Cornet in the first two rounds, Williams faced Ukraine's Elina Svitolina in the third round in what was a rematch of this year's French Open fourth round, but lost to the Ukrainian, bringing an end to her Olympics campaign.[239] Days after the Olympics, Williams took a late wildcard for the Western & Southern Open, where she was the defending champion, but then decided to withdraw owing to concerns from the same shoulder injury/inflammation from earlier in the summer.[240]
The week of September 5, 2016, marked Williams's 186th consecutive week ranked No. 1, equalling Steffi Graf's record for longest run in WTA history. In the semifinals of the US Open, Williams lost to Karolína Plíšková.[241] Having won the US Open, Angelique Kerber became the No. 1, ending Williams's No. 1 streak. Williams also pulled out of the WTA Finals because of a shoulder injury.[242]

2017: Australian Open victory and pregnancy
Main article: 2017 Serena Williams tennis season
Williams started her 2017 season by participating in the WTA Auckland Open for the first time in her career. She defeated Pauline Parmentier to win her first match since the US Open. In the second round, she lost to Madison Brengle. At the Australian Open, she beat former and present top 10 players Belinda Bencic, Lucie Šafářová, Johanna Konta among others to reach her 8th Australian Open final. On January 28, 2017, she won the Australian Open for an Open Era record seventh time, defeating her sister, Venus.[243] It was her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, surpassing Steffi Graf's Open Era record of 22. It was the first time in the Open Era that two players aged 35 or older had competed in the final of a Grand Slam tournament. The win ensured her return to the No. 1 ranking.[244][245] Williams subsequently withdrew from the Indian Wells and Miami Opens, citing a knee injury.[246]
On April 19, 2017, Williams revealed that she was 20 weeks pregnant and would miss the remainder of the season.[247] The timing of her announcement led to the conclusion that she would have been roughly eight to nine weeks pregnant when she won the Australian Open.[248] In interviews, she said that she intended to return to tennis after her pregnancy,[249] saying that she had an "outrageous plan" of competing in the 2018 Australian Open.[249]
On September 1, 2017, Williams gave birth to a daughter.[250] She had a cesarean-section delivery due to a pulmonary embolism during labor.[251] She suffered another pulmonary embolism after giving birth, leaving her bedridden for six weeks and delaying her return to training.[252]
On December 30, 2017, Williams played her first match since giving birth, an exhibition match at the World Tennis Championship in Abu Dhabi, losing to reigning French Open champion Jeļena Ostapenko.

 Williams at the 2018 French Open, her first grand slam since returning to the tour
2018: Return to tennis, Wimbledon and US Open runner up
On January 5, 2018, Williams withdrew from the upcoming Australian Open, citing a lack of sufficient preparation in the wake of her pregnancy.[253] In February, after overcoming her pregnancy-induced health problems, she returned to the tennis court with her sister. The pair lost to Lesley Kerkhove and Demi Schuurs (Netherlands) in the Fed Cup's first round on February 11.[254] Despite saying she was 100% ready to come back to tennis, Williams suffered back to back early exits at Indian Wells and Miami, losing in the third round at Indian Wells to her sister Venus and the first round at Miami to 2018 Indian Wells champion Naomi Osaka.[citation needed]
Williams made her return to Grand Slam tennis at the 2018 French Open, playing singles and doubles with her sister Venus. In the first round, she defeated Kristýna Plíšková in two tight sets and later 17th seed Ashleigh Barty in the second round. Then, she defeated 11th seed Julia Görges to set up a fourth-round match against 28th seed Maria Sharapova, whom she had beaten 18 consecutive times since 2004. Williams withdrew owing to an injury to her pectoral muscle sustained in a third-round match in doubles where she and Venus were defeated by Andreja Klepač and María José Martínez Sánchez.[255][256]
In July, Williams entered the Wimbledon Championships and was controversially seeded #25. With a world ranking at the time of 181,[257] many felt that the decision showed bias and favored Williams unduly.[258] Others argued that the All England Club, who do not base their seedings on players' current world rankings – as other grand slam tournaments do – had sensibly considered Williams's excellent historic record there. Williams herself said: "I was pleasantly surprised. I came in here expecting that maybe I wouldn't get a seed."[258] Her seeding resulted in Dominika Cibulková losing her place to be seeded.[citation needed]
By the second week of the tournament, for the first time in grand slam history, none of the top ten seeded women players had made it to the quarterfinals.[259] En route to the quarterfinals, Williams had beaten Arantxa Rus of Holland in round one, Viktoriya Tomova of Bulgaria in round 2, Kristina Mladenovic of France in round 3 and Evgeniya Rodina of Russia in round 4.[260] She had not lost a set in any of her matches till then. Williams then beat Italian Camila Giorgi in the quarterfinals after losing one set, and became the lowest ranked player to ever reach the Wimbledon semifinals.[261] She met 13th seed Julia Görges of Germany in the semifinal and beat her comfortably in two sets to reach her tenth Wimbledon final, the first since giving birth. She lost in the final in straight sets to Angelique Kerber of Germany in a rematch of the 2016 Wimbledon final.
Following her Wimbledon finals run, Williams entered the 2018 Silicon Valley Classic, her first appearance in a US Open series tournament since 2015. She recorded her most lopsided loss in her career to Johanna Konta in the first round, winning just a single game.[262] Williams later revealed in an interview with Time that she checked Instagram ten minutes prior to the match starting, and found out that the man who had fatally shot her half-sister, Yetunde, in 2003 was released on parole earlier in the year. She said in the interview, "I couldn't shake it out of my mind."[263]
Williams's next tournament was the Cincinnati Masters. She beat Daria Gavrilova of Australia in straight sets in the first round, but lost to Petra Kvitová in the second round in a three-set match that lasted over two hours.[citation needed] Her next tournament was the 2018 US Open in Flushing Meadows, New York, where she was seeded 17th, although ranked 26th in the WTA ranking at the time seeds were determined. She defeated Magda Linette in the first round, Carina Witthöft in the second round, her sister and 16th seed Venus in the third round, Kaia Kanepi in the fourth round, and 8th seed Karolína Plíšková in the quarterfinals. The match against Plíšková was a rematch of the 2016 US Open semifinal, which Plíšková had won. This was Williams's first win against a player in the top 10 (at the time of the match) since her return from pregnancy. Williams won her semifinal match against 19th seed Anastasija Sevastova of Latvia, winning a spot in the women's singles final against Naomi Osaka of Japan which she lost in straight sets. Williams was warned for illegal coaching, penalized a point for breaking her racket, and then penalized a game for verbal abuse of the chair umpire.

2019: Return to the top 10, injuries, Wimbledon and US Open runner-up
Williams started her 2019 season at the Australian Open, having not made an appearance at the tournament since winning the 2017 edition. Seeded 16th, she defeated Tatjana Maria, Eugenie Bouchard, and Dayana Yastremska in the first three rounds, before defeating top seed and world number one Simona Halep in the fourth. In the quarterfinals, she met 7th seed Karolína Plíšková. Plíšková won the first set and lead in the second, but Williams took control of the match, winning the second and rapidly taking a huge lead in the third. However, after Williams twisted her ankle while up match point, Plíšková won six consecutive games, saving four match points throughout the set to win the match. This was Williams's earliest defeat at the Australian Open since her fourth-round loss in 2014, and broke a streak of fourteen consecutive match wins in Grand Slam quarterfinals (having last lost a Grand Slam quarterfinal at the 2013 Australian Open). Despite this loss, her ranking climbed up to number 11.[citation needed]
Williams went on to defeat Victoria Azarenka in the second round of the Indian Wells Masters in her 2019 campaign for a third Indian Wells crown. In the third round, viral illness caused her to retire against Spain's Garbiñe Muguruza. This was the second consecutive year she had exited at this stage. She then sustained a recurrence of a long-term knee injury which caused her to pull out of Miami and Rome after playing one match. She could not train properly until after the French Open, where she lost in the third round.[264] At Wimbledon, Williams reached a major final for the 13th consecutive year. She also became the oldest grand slam finalist in the open era.[265] She lost the final to Simona Halep in two straight sets in under an hour.[266]
At the Canadian Open, Williams defeated Naomi Osaka in straight sets in the quarterfinals and Czech qualifier Marie Bouzkova in three sets in the semi finals. Against Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu, she retired in the first set after 19 minutes. She told the chair umpire of her decision to retire because of back spasms.[267] Her back problems continued at the Cincinnati Open, where she withdrew shortly before her first-round match, stating, "Unfortunately my back is still not right."[268]
Williams was seeded eighth at the US Open. In the first round she met Maria Sharapova for the first time since the 2016 Australian Open, defeating her in straight sets, yielding just one game in each set. She defeated Caty McNally in three sets in the second round, and Karolína Muchová and Petra Martić in straight games in the third and fourth. In the quarterfinals she faced 18th seed Wang Qiang, who she overcame in just 45 minutes, yielding a single game. In the semifinals she defeated fifth seed Elina Svitolina, proceeding to the final where she faced 15th seed Bianca Andreescu for the second time in under a month. With Andreescu up a set and five games to one in the second set, Williams launched a spirited comeback to level the set at 5-games-all. However, Andreescu was able to hold serve and break Williams to win the title in straight sets.[269] This was Williams's last match of the year which she ended ranked No. 10.

2020: First title since maternity leave
Top-seeded Williams won her first singles title as a mother at the 2020 ASB Classic, defeating Jessica Pegula in the final.[270] She also reached the finals in the doubles tournament with Caroline Wozniacki; the pair were defeated by Asia Muhammad and Taylor Townsend.[271] Hence, she became the first woman in the professional era with at least one title in four decades: the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s.[272]
Williams's next tournament was the 2020 Australian Open where she was seeded 8th. She defeated Anastasia Potapova and Tamara Zidanšek in the first and second rounds respectively in straight sets, before falling to Wang Qiang in three tight sets in the third round.
On the resumption of the WTA Tour following a pause caused by COVID-19, Williams entered the Top Seed Open as the top seed. Following a tough three-set win over Bernarda Pera in the first round, Williams faced her sister Venus for their 31st WTA match in the second round and came through after dropping the first set. Williams went on to suffer a shock defeat in the quarter finals to fellow American Shelby Rogers. At the Cincinnati Open, played in New York, Williams received a bye in the first round, beat Arantxa Rus in the second, and lost to Maria Sakkari in three sets in the third round.
Williams was seeded 3rd at the second major of the year, the 2020 US Open. After two straight sets victories to begin with, Williams faced former grand slam champion Sloane Stephens in the third round, winning in three sets. In the fourth round, Williams avenged her loss to Sakkari in the previous tournament. In the quarter-finals, she defeated Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria who was playing in her first tournament in three years after giving birth. She thus advanced into the semifinals, where she faced Victoria Azarenka, losing in three sets.[273][274] Her match with Azarenka marked the first time two mothers met in a Grand Slam semi-final.[275] She also became the first player in history to reach the semifinals of Grand slam and US Open in four decades: the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s.
Williams was seeded 6th at the delayed 2020 French Open held in cold and heavy conditions in October. After defeating Kristie Ahn in straight sets in the first round, Williams withdrew before her second round match against wildcard Tsvetana Pironkova, citing an achilles injury she had sustained during her semi-final defeat to Azarenka at the US Open. This meant for the first time since 2006, Serena failed to reach a Grand Slam final.

2021: Australian Open semifinal, out of top 40
Williams started the year by playing the Yarra Valley Classic, where she withdrew prior to her semifinal match against the top seed, Ashleigh Barty citing a right shoulder injury.[276]
In the Australian Open Williams was seeded 10th and lost to the 4th seed, Naomi Osaka, in the semifinal after defeating 2nd seed, Simona Halep, and 7th seed, Aryna Sabalenka, along the way. Williams's match with Osaka was the first time the two had met in a major since the infamous 2018 US Open final. When leaving the court after losing to Osaka in the Australian Open, Williams paused to acknowledge the crowd longer than she usually would. In the press conference following the match, she faced questions about whether she was bidding farewell to tennis and retiring. She said "I don't know, if I ever say farewell, I wouldn't tell anyone."[277]
In May, at the Italian Open, Serena Williams played her 1000th match of her career.[278] She was defeated by Nadia Podoroska in the second round in straight sets.[279]
On June 29, Williams would suffer an injury during the first set in the first round at Wimbledon against Belarusian player Aliaksandra Sasnovich, forcing her to withdraw from the competition.[280][281]
In August 2021, a leg injury forced Williams to withdraw from 2021 US Open.[282] Her withdrawal saw Williams plummet nineteen places to 41st in the world, her lowest year-end ranking in 15 years.

2022: King Richard promotion, Wimbledon and US Open, retirement
 The Williams sisters in 2022 during their final doubles match together
In December 2021, Williams announced she would not play the 2022 Australian Open, citing the same leg injury.[283] As of March 2022, she was ranked 241st.
She spent much of early 2022 promoting King Richard about her father with her sisters. She appeared at several award ceremonies including the 94th Academy Awards.[284]
Williams returned to professional play in June 2022 when she partnered up with Ons Jabeur in the Eastbourne International.[285] The pairing beat Sara Sorribes Tormo and Marie Bouzková in the first round, and Shuko Aoyama and Chan Hao-ching in the second.[286][287] The pairing retired from the tournament afterwards owing to an injury sustained by Jabeur.[288] Williams also entered the 2022 Wimbledon Championships in singles, having accepted a wildcard after dropping to 1204th in the singles rankings.[289] She lost to Harmony Tan in the first round in an over 3 hour match, the longest thus far at the tournament.[290][291]
In August, Williams wrote an article for Vogue, in which she announced her plans to 'evolve away' from tennis after the US Open, indicating retirement.[292][293] Williams began her farwell tour by entering the 2022 Canadian Open using a protected ranking. She beat Nuria Párrizas Díaz in straight sets for her first singles win in 14 months, before losing to Belinda Bencic.[294][295] Williams subsequently entered the 2022 Cincinnati Masters, in which she lost to reigning US Open champion Emma Raducanu in the first round.[296]
Before the US Open, Williams announced she would play doubles with Venus for the first time since 2018. Their opening-round match marked the first time a first-round doubles match was held in the Arthur Ashe Stadium during television primetime. The sisters lost to the Czech duo of Lucie Hradecká and Linda Nosková.[297]
In singles, Williams won her opening-round match against Danka Kovinić. In the second round, she upset world No. 2 Anett Kontaveit to become the oldest woman ever to defeat a top-three ranked player.[citation needed] She then played what was expected to be her final match against Ajla Tomljanović, losing in three hard-fought sets.

Transition from tennis
In the September 2022 issue of Vogue, written in August, Williams announced that she was "evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me". In her announcement she said that she disliked the word "retirement" and preferred the term "evolution".[298]
She went on to cite growing her family, focusing on her venture capital firm, and spending more time with family as reasons she would be leaving the sport. While she did not set an exact time for her goodbye, she stated that she was not ready to win Wimbledon (where she lost in the first round), but would try to win in New York. She also said that she consulted Tiger Woods in her decision.[298]
At her first match since the publication of the Vogue article, where she lost to Belinda Bencic in Toronto, tournament organizers interviewed Williams on-court after her match and gave her gifts to remember the city.[299]
At her matches at the 2022 US Open, which many believed would be her last tournament, tournament directors played a video following her opponents' introduction but before Williams' walk-out. Some saw this as disrespectful to her opponents.[300]
Following her first-round match, where Woods, Mike Tyson, Bill Clinton, Ruth Westheimer, Spike Lee, Vera Wang, and Eric Adams were in attendance, the tournament played a video narrated by Oprah Winfrey and had Gayle King facilitate the post-match on-court interview.[301][302][303]
Following her announcement, many fellow players, including Naomi Osaka and Coco Gauff, praised Williams and said they would not be playing tennis if not for her.[304]

Playing style
Williams is an aggressive baseliner, whose game is centered around her powerful serve and forceful groundstrokes. Owing to her high-risk playing style, she typically hits a large number of both winners and unforced errors. Williams' greatest asset is her serve, which is considered the greatest in the history of women's tennis. Her serve is known for its fast pace and accurate placement, allowing her to serve numerous aces: at the 2013 Australian Open, she served a 128.6 mph (207 km/h) ace in her third round match against Ayumi Morita, which is the third fastest serve recorded in WTA history.[305] Williams possesses an accurate and consistent ball toss, allowing her to serve to any position on the court with minimal differences in the position of the ball in the air; this makes it difficult for opponents to read her service motion and predict the position of her serve, allowing her to dominate a rally from the first stroke.[306] Williams also possesses effective and accurate kick and slice serves, which she deploys as second serves, minimizing double faults, and preventing opponents from scoring free points.[307]
Williams is also known for her forceful groundstrokes, which are considered two of the most powerful shots in the history of women's tennis.[308] She hits both her forehand and her backhand in an open stance, allowing her to generate consistently powerful, heavy, and dominating groundstrokes, and to generate sharp, acute angles, which allow her to hit winners from any position on the court.[309] Williams is known for her forehand, which has been described as "devastating".[310] Her forehand is hit with heavy topspin; this allows her to dominate rallies, and she is capable of hitting her forehand both crosscourt and down the line to produce winners.[311] Her two-handed backhand is equally dominant, and has been described as one of the greatest backhands of all time.[312] Williams tends to hit her backhand flatter than her forehand, allowing her to hit her backhand with speed, power, and depth both crosscourt and down the line. Despite playing primarily from the baseline, Williams is an adept net player thanks to her extensive doubles experience, and will frequently choose to finish points at the net, either with deft touch, aggressive drive volleys, or a solid, powerful, and reliable overhead smash.[313] Williams possesses an aggressive return of serve – she neutralizes powerful first serves, and attacks weak second serves. She is widely considered one of the greatest return players of all time.[314]
Despite predominantly employing an aggressive game style, she is also an excellent defender, and is capable of counterpunching against aggressive opponents until she creates an opportunity to hit a winner. She is an exceptional athlete, known for her movement, speed, court coverage, agility, flexibility, balance, and footwork. Her on-court intelligence, shot selection, and point construction allow her to execute her gamestyle effectively.[315] She has been praised for her mental strength and competitive spirit, with her being described as one of the toughest opponents to beat on the court; Martina Navratilova declared her mental strength "unbelievable",[316] whilst tennis journalist Jon Wertheim claimed that Williams is the toughest player of all time.[317] American tennis player Christina McHale praised her composure in high pressure moments, stating that, for Williams, "being clutch is like breathing", and that she "seems to come through every single time in the most pressure-packed situations".[318] She has been noted for her ability to produce extraordinary comebacks, particularly on the Grand Slam level, winning three Slams after saving match points, a feat achieved more often than by any other player in tennis history.[319] Williams bounced back from a set down to win 37 Grand Slam matches; her ability to come back from set and break deficits in Grand Slam matches was described by John McEnroe as "a gift", and McEnroe declared that she was "the greatest" competitor in the history of women's tennis.[320] She has also been praised for her ability to serve aces at critical moments. As noted by retired player Li Na in 2016, "break point down, [there is an] 80% chance [she] serves an ace".[321]
Owing to her exceptional serve, powerful groundstrokes, technical mastery, aggressive return of serve, athleticism, and mental strength, Williams has been described as one of the most complete players on tour, and one of the greatest players of all time, irrespective of gender.[322] Williams has stated that her favourite surface is clay, as the slow pace and high bounce afforded aids point construction, although she also excels on faster hard and grass courts.[323]

Rivalries
Serena vs. Venus
Main article: Williams sisters rivalry
Williams played older sister Venus in 31 professional matches since 1998.[54] Overall, Serena is 19–12 against her sister.[54] Serena played Venus 15 times in Grand Slam singles and 13 times in other tournaments (including 11 finals).[324] They have met in nine Grand Slam tournament finals, with Serena winning seven times.[54] Beginning with the 2002 French Open, they played each other in four consecutive Grand Slam finals, which was the first time in the Open Era that the same two players had contested four consecutive finals in Grand Slam singles.[325]

Williams vs. Hingis
Main article: Hingis–S. Williams rivalry
Williams leads the series 7–6.[326] One of Williams's first rivalries was with Martina Hingis, who turned pro less than one year before her (Hingis in October 1994, Williams in 1995). They first played each other at the 1998 Miami Open where Hingis won in three sets. All but one of their matches was played on a hard court with the exception being a contest on clay in Rome 1999, which Hingis won in straight sets. Their last match took place at the 2002 Miami Open with Williams winning in a loss of just four games.[327] Hingis was forced to briefly retire citing ankle injuries.[328]

Williams vs. Capriati
Williams leads the series against Jennifer Capriati 10–7.[329] Once considered one of the best rivalries in women's tennis,[330] the competition between Williams and Capriati was stiff with 12 out of 17 meetings going three sets. The rivalry, starting in 1999, began one sided with Capriati winning four of their first five matches. Williams would then go on to win the next eight.[329] Williams and Capriati played with similar styles, both known for using their power and athleticism to gain quick advantages in points.[331][332]

Williams vs. Henin
Main article: Henin–S. Williams rivalry
Williams leads the series 8–6. Justine Henin and Williams met 14 times, five of which were in tournament finals. In majors they have faced each other seven times with Henin leading 4–3.[333] Opposite personalities and styles of play are often cited as what made their rivalry entertaining.[334][335]
In the semifinals of the 2003 French Open, when at 4–2, 30–0 on Williams's serve in the third set, Henin raised her hand to indicate she was not ready to receive; Williams then put her serve into the net. The umpire did not see Henin raise her hand, and thus did not allow Williams a first serve. Williams lost the game and would go on to lose the match. Their last match took place in the final of the 2010 Australian Open where Williams won in three sets to take her 12th major title.[333]

Williams vs. Azarenka
Williams leads the series 18–5. The rivalry began at the 2008 Australian Open, and their most recent match was in the semifinals of the 2020 US Open. Williams holds a 10–1 record in Grand Slams. Azarenka is the only person to ever win four WTA tour level finals against Williams.[336] While their rivalry is heavily favored towards Williams, their matches are known for their fierce competitiveness, and Azarenka is considered the only player to truly challenge Williams following the retirement of Capriati, Henin, and Hingis, with 9 of their matches extending to three sets.[337]

Williams vs. Sharapova
Williams leads the series 20–2. The pair first met in the fourth round of the 2004 Miami Open, where Williams defeated Sharapova 6–4, 6–3. Their rivalry truly began at the 2004 Wimbledon final, where Williams was the two-time defending champion; Sharapova upset her 6–1, 6–4. Williams next lost to Sharapova in the finals of the 2004 WTA Tour Championships, 6–4, 2–6, 4–6. Since then, however, Williams dominated the rivalry, winning all of their clashes, with only three of their matches going to three sets. They met 10 times in Grand Slam tournaments, where Williams led 9–1, and they further met in 9 finals, with Williams leading 7–2. Sharapova retired in February 2020, with their final match being in the first round of the 2019 US Open; Williams defeated Sharapova 6–1, 6–1 in one hour exactly. Despite the one-sided nature of their rivalry, it is considered one of the most prominent rivalries on the WTA Tour of the 21st century, due to alleged personality clashes, similarly aggressive playing styles, and significant media interest.[338]

Match controversies
Accusations of match fixing
When both of the Williams sisters entered the top ten and started meeting in tournaments, rumors of match fixing started to circulate. John McEnroe, while commenting on the 2000 Wimbledon semifinal between the two sisters, said that "Serena may not be allowed to win. Richard [Williams] may have something to say about this."[339] After losing to Venus at the Indian Wells quarterfinals in 2001, Elena Dementieva asserted during a post-match interview that Richard Williams decided the results of matches between the two sisters.[340] Shortly after that, Venus Williams pulled out of her Indian Wells semifinal match against Serena Williams at the last minute, claiming tendinitis; this occurrence garnered much speculation in the press, and some fans demanded their money back.[341][342][343]

Indian Wells boycott
At the 2001 Ericsson Open the following week, Richard Williams stated that racist comments were made to him in the stands,[344] and the tournament director refused to offer Williams an apology for how he was treated.[citation needed] As a result, neither sister played the tournament even though it had become a mandatory stop on the WTA tour since 2009. In 2015, Williams decided to end her 14-year boycott and played.[345]

2004 US Open
In her US Open quarterfinal match against Jennifer Capriati, an incorrect overrule was made by chair umpire Mariana Alves; the video review showed that Williams's shot landed in bounds. In the same match, new technology being tested made incorrect line calls late in the third set. Williams argued with the chair over a couple of calls during the match, but was not successful. Capriati won the match, with Serena herself acknowledging that this was primarily due to her 57 unforced errors; nevertheless, she accused Alves of temporary insanity[346] and said that she "felt cheated".[347] In a post-match interview Capriati sharply observed that bad calls had gone against her in the past as well. Alves did not officiate for the remainder of the tournament; this was not punitive, as commonly thought, as she was not scheduled to officiate.[348] The controversy renewed calls for, and was widely given credit for, the adoption of technology such as the MacCAM and Hawk-Eye systems.[349]

2009 US Open
In the US Open semifinal round against Kim Clijsters, Williams slammed her racket on the court after losing the first set. She was given a warning, with a potential second violation carrying a one-point penalty. While trailing 4–6, 5–6, 15–30, Williams's second serve was called a foot fault, resulting in two match points for Clijsters. Williams gestured with her racket to the lineswoman who had made the call and yelled at her, with profanities and a threat to shove a tennis ball down the lineswoman's throat.[350] During the subsequent on-court conference between the chair umpire, the lineswoman, US Open officials, and Williams, a television microphone picked up Williams saying to the lineswoman, "I didn't say I would kill you! Are you serious?"[351] The incident resulted in Williams being penalized a point for unsportsmanlike conduct‍—‌necessitated by the earlier warning for racket abuse‍—‌meaning Clijsters won the match 6–4, 7–5. The following day, Williams was issued the maximum permissible on-site fine of $10,000 (plus $500 for racket abuse). After further investigation, the Grand Slam Committee in November 2009 fined her $175,000 in place of suspending her from the 2010 US Open or other Grand Slam events.[352] They also placed her on a two-year probation which provided that if Williams committed another offense at a Grand Slam event in the next two years, she would be suspended from participating in the following US Open. If, however, she committed no offenses within the next two years, her fine would be reduced to $82,500.[352] Williams initially refused to apologize for her outburst, both in her post-match press conference[353] and in an official statement released the following day.[124] She eventually did apologize, stating "I just really wanted to apologize sincerely because I'm a very prideful person, and I'm a very intense person and a very emotional person", and "I wanted to offer my sincere apologies to anyone that I may have offended." She said she was humbled by the experience.[354]

2011 US Open
In the final of the 2011 US Open against Samantha Stosur, Williams shouted "Come on!" as the Australian attempted to return a forehand Williams believed to be a winner. The chair umpire Eva Asderaki awarded the point to Stosur based on the ITF's deliberate hindrance rule, which states, "If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if involuntary, the point shall be replayed."[355] As the point was 30–40 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur. Williams became angry with the chair umpire and made several gestures and unflattering comments toward her during the next changeover, including telling Asderaki that if the umpire ever saw Serena coming toward her, she should "look the other way".[356] Williams initially gained momentum in the set following the penalty, breaking back in the next game, but eventually flagged and lost the match, 2–6, 3–6. At the end of the match, she declined to offer the customary handshake to Asderaki.[357][358] Williams mentioned the incident in her post-match speech as the tournament runner-up, asserting, "I hit a winner, but I guess it didn't count", but added, "It wouldn't have mattered in the end. Sam played well."[359] A writer for ESPN suggested that Williams could avoid being found to have violated the terms of the "probation" on which she was placed following her 2009 outburst, as she did not appear to have used profanity in addressing Asderaki during the match.[360] In the end, Williams was fined $2,000 and was not barred from competing in the 2012 US Open because "Williams' conduct, while verbally abusive, does not rise to the level of a major offense under the Grand Slam Code of Conduct."[361]

2018 US Open
Williams's 2018 US Open ended in controversy with Williams falling to Naomi Osaka in straight sets following a game penalty in the second set of the final. During that second set, she was given a code violation because her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, gave her coaching hand signals. Williams was upset by the violation, claiming that her coach was simply giving her a thumbs up, and demanded an apology from chair umpire Carlos Ramos. Mouratoglou later admitted that he was coaching.[362] She received a second violation for smashing her racket on the court, which resulted in a point penalty. After her third code violation for verbal abuse against the umpire, Williams was assessed a game penalty.[363][364] Williams said that she believed she was treated unfairly by the umpire because she is a woman.[365] Williams was fined a total of $17,000 including $4,000 for a coaching violation, $3,000 for racket abuse and $10,000 for verbal abuse towards the umpire.[366]

Other issues
In the beginning years of Williams' professional career, hair beads donned by the Williams sisters were the focus of discussion by commentators such as Chris Evert and John McEnroe, with Mary Carillo characterizing their hair as "noisy and disruptive".[367] The beads often broke and scattered across the court. Scholar Nancy E. Spencer said that commentary that dismissed the Williams' cultural hairstyles served to "other" the sisters, particularly in the context of a white dominated sport where their appearance and specifically their physicality is a popular topic for discussion.[367]
Following the match controversy at the 2018 US Open final between Williams and Naomi Osaka, the Melbourne newspaper the Herald Sun published a cartoon by Mark Knight depicting Williams having a tantrum and breaking her racket while the umpire asks her opponent to "just let her win".[368] The cartoon was widely criticized as racist and sexist, including by Williams's husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, and author J. K. Rowling.[369][370] Complaints centered around the portrayal of Williams as an angry black woman with exaggerated large lips, a broad flat nose, and positioned in an ape-like pose, and the portrayal of Williams's opponent, Osaka, who is half-Japanese, half-Haitian, with blonde hair.[371] The editor of the Herald Sun argued the cartoon was unfairly criticized on social media.[372] Knight defended his work, saying that his satire was never about race or gender, but was about putting a spotlight on bad behavior by sporting superstars. In the immediate aftermath of the controversy he suspended his Twitter account to "protect his family and friends".[372]
In September 2019, Romanian television host Radu Banciu made the following comments during a live broadcast: "Serena Williams looks exactly like one of those monkeys at the zoo with the red asses."[373] Romania's National Council for Combating Discrimination fined Banciu approximately $1,875 for his comments.

Legacy
Williams is considered one of the best female tennis players of all time. In 2017, BBC Sport users picked Williams as the greatest female tennis player of the Open Era. BBC presenter and former French Open Champion, Sue Barker, said "Serena is the greatest because this era is so much more competitive than previous eras. The pace she generates – her serve is without question the greatest ever – combined with her movement and her power, she pushes her opponents constantly on the back foot".[374] In 2018, a Tennis.com panel selected Serena as the greatest female tennis player in the Open Era.[375] Some commentators, players and sports writers regard Williams as the greatest woman tennis player of all time.[b] In 2018, Federer said the player who probably had the best case for tennis "Greatest Of All Time", man or woman, was Serena Williams.[377] In 2020, the Tennis Channel ranked Williams as the greatest woman tennis player of all time.[378] In 2022, John McEnroe described Williams as an "icon" and the "GOAT of GOATs".[379][380]

Alongside her sister Venus, Williams has been widely credited with increasing diversity within the sport:[381][382][383]It all starts with Venus and Serena. The demonstration effect. The power of seeing two African-American girls with braids in the finals of the biggest tournaments in the world in a predominantly white sport. Just a huge impact that really can't be overstated. That attracted thousands of girls into the sport, not just African-American but all backgrounds and races.
— Martin Blackman, General Manager of Player Development, United States Tennis Association[384]Former U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens, French Open finalist Coco Gauff and four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka, have thanked Williams, saying that they never would've picked up a racket, if it was not for her.[385]
For their first match of March 2019, the women of the United States women's national soccer team each wore a jersey with the name of a woman they were honoring on the back; Crystal Dunn chose the name of Serena Williams.[386]
In December 2019, The Associated Press named Williams Female Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s.[387]
In September 2022, Twitter said that Williams was the most tweeted about female athlete ever.[388]

Personal life
 Williams's husband Alexis Ohanian in 2018
Williams is married to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. He proposed to her on December 10, 2016, in Rome.[389] On December 30, 2016, Williams announced their engagement in a Reddit post.[390] They married on November 16, 2017, in New Orleans. Guests at the wedding included Beyoncé, Anna Wintour, Kelly Rowland and Kim Kardashian.[391] She planned to move to San Francisco with Ohanian after the wedding.[249]
On April 19, 2017, Williams posted a sideways picture of herself on Snapchat that focused on her midsection; it had the caption, "20 weeks", prompting speculation that she was pregnant.[392] Later that evening, her spokesperson confirmed the pregnancy.[393] The fact that she was 20 weeks pregnant when announcing her pregnancy meant that she was eight weeks pregnant when she won the Australian Open earlier that year.[394] Williams later said that posting the picture on Snapchat was an accident, and that she had intended to save the photo for her records.[395]
In September 2017, Williams gave birth to her daughter.[396][397] She had an emergency caesarean-section delivery due to the baby's heart rate dropping during labor and was at first devastated about it.[251] She suffered a pulmonary embolism after giving birth, leaving her bedridden for six weeks and delaying her return to training.[252] (This encounter was not her first with the disease venous thromboembolism; she had been hospitalized in 2011 for pulmonary embolism thought to have originated from a deep vein thrombosis.)[398] In August 2018, she revealed she was suffering from postpartum depression.[399] Williams gave her daughter a doll, Qai Qai, that has become famous on social media.[400] She has also faced many questions whether she would raise her daughter to play tennis to which she answered saying she has already hired a coach for her daughter. She also posts many pictures of her and her daughter on the tennis court with rackets.[401]
Williams was raised one of Jehovah's Witness, but states she has "never really practiced it".[249] She often thanks Jehovah after winning matches.[402] Williams confirmed that she follows some practices: "(she) doesn't celebrate birthdays. We're Jehovah's Witnesses, so we don't do that."[403] In January 2023, about half a year after her retirement, she was baptized as a Jehovah's Witness in Florida.[404]
Williams' current agent is former player Jill Smoller.[405]

Off-court activities
Equipment and endorsements
In the early 2000s, Williams wore Puma apparel and footwear on court.[406] Williams signed a five-year endorsement deal with Nike in 2004 for $40 million, and has been endorsed by the company for clothing, apparel, and footwear ever since.[407] Nike designs custom clothing for Williams, which she wears on the court along with custom footwear. The largest building on Nike's Portland campus is the one million square foot Serena Williams Building which features many references to the athlete's career and her long collaboration with Nike.[408][409] According to John Hoke, Nike's Chief Design Officer, Williams made an important contribution to the creative process of the design of the building.[410]
She used the Wilson Hammer Stretch range of racquets when she won her first Grand Slam title in 1999, before switching to the Hyper Hammer range.[411] She switched to the Wilson nCode briefly in 2005, and used various iterations of the Wilson Blade racquet since 2008. Her racquet is typically oversized, with a head size of 104 square inches. Since 2017, Wilson has manufactured a signature racquet, the Wilson Blade SW104, which is designed to Williams's specifications. Since 2020, Williams used a smaller variant of this racquet, the Wilson Blade SW102 Autograph.[412]
Williams also has endorsement deals with AbbVie, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Aston Martin, AT&T, Audemars Piguet, Beats by Dre, Berlei Bras, Block Inc, Bumble, Chase Bank, Delta Air Lines, DirecTV, DoorDash, Ford Motor, Gatorade, Gucci, Hanes, IBM, Intel, Mission Athletecare, OnePiece, OPI Products, Pepsi, Subway,Tempur, Tonal and the Walt Disney Company.[33][413][414][415]
In 2015, Williams became the CSO (Chief Sporting Officer) for British luxury automobile manufacturer Aston Martin. She then posted her first experience on social media service Twitter, and said: "I'm loving my first day on the job as Chief Sporting Officer and Director of Fun!", stating her optimism on the job as the CSO.[416][417]
Williams is also on the board of directors at SurveyMonkey.[418]

Fashion
Williams has been noted for her unusual and colorful outfits on court. In 2002, there was much talk when she wore a black lycra catsuit at the US Open.[419] At the 2004 US Open, Williams wore denim skirts and knee-high boots—tournament officials did not allow her to wear the boots during matches.[420] At the 2008 Wimbledon, the white trench coat she wore during warm-up for her opening match was the subject of much discussion since it was worn despite sunny weather.[421] Some social scientists have argued that the most negative reactions to Williams's on-court fashion statements, especially in newspaper coverage of the Australian Open and Wimbledon, combines with writers' fixation upon her muscular body to distract from her on-court accomplishments and fit this commentary within centuries-old narratives of the "pornographic eroticism" and "sexual grotesquerie" of African and African-American women.[422]
Williams formerly had a special line with Puma.[423] In April 2004, she signed a deal worth US$40 million for a line with Nike.[424] Since 2004, she has also run her own line of designer apparel, "Aneres"—her first name spelled backward. In 2009, she launched a signature collection of handbags and jewelry.[425] The collection, Signature Statement, is sold mainly on the Home Shopping Network (HSN).[426]
In early 2010, Williams became a certified nail technician in preparation for her upcoming nail collection with a company called HairTech.[427] In 2015, she became the first black female athlete to have a picture by herself on the cover of Vogue, which she did for the April 2015 issue.[428] In 2015, she also presented her HSN Signature Statement collection for the second time at the New York Fashion Week Show‍—‌a clothing line exclusively made for the retailer HSN.[426]
In May 2018, she wore a skin-tight catsuit at the 2018 French Open that likened a superhero outfit and helped promote her new clothing line, Serena.[429][430][431] The outfit was subsequently banned by the French Tennis Federation president Bernard Giudicelli, with the explanation: "It will no longer be accepted. One must respect the game and the place." Williams then wore a black tutu to her first match at the 2018 US Open on August 27, 2018, against Magda Linette which she dominated in straight sets.[432][433] In February 2019, Serena Williams was appointed to the board of directors of online fashion marketplace Poshmark.[434]
In Fall 2019, Williams launched the first collection of her sustainable clothing line, S by Serena.[435] Inspired by 1990s street wear, S by Serena collections are shown on a range of body types and sizes (ranging from XS to 3X), highlighting the line's focus on inclusivity.[436]

Activism
Williams became more involved in social change as her career progressed, primarily using social media as a medium of expressing her views. In 2016 she posted her support of Black Lives Matter on her Facebook page, voicing her concern about her young nephew being in danger from police officers owing to his skin color.[437] During American tennis player Tennys Sandgren's breakthrough run to the quarterfinals of the 2018 Australian Open, it was revealed that he tweeted insensitive words about the LGBT community, followed members of the alt-right, and referred to an article describing Williams's on-court behavior as "disgusting". Williams responded by tweeting her displeasure, saying, "@TennysSandgren I don't need or want one. But there is an entire group of people that deserves an apology. I can't look at my daughter and tell her I sat back and was quiet. No! She will know how to stand up for herself and others – through my example." Additionally, she attached an image that read, "Maturity is being able to apologize and admit when you're wrong because you know that your mistakes don't define you".[438]
Also in 2016, Serena Williams wrote an open letter in Porter Magazine's "Incredible Women of 2016" to speak out about gender equality and her personal struggles as a woman in tennis.[439] She noted that women's contributions to the sport of tennis are not recognized in the way men's contributions are recognized; she also called out issues of equal pay in tennis. She ended the letter stating that she hoped that her letter would inspire a new generation of women to "push for greatness and follow their dreams with steadfast resilience."[440]
Williams received several awards for her activism, namely those directed towards Black communities. She was listed among the 35 "most remarkable and beautiful black women" in the world by Essence magazine.[441] The NAACP honored Williams with the President's Award at the annual NAACP Image Awards.[citation needed][442]
Williams, in 2014, founded the equity company "Serena Ventures".[443] The firm's goal is to help start-up companies whose perspectives and innovations level the playing field for women and people of color.

Entertainment
Williams has appeared on television and also provided voice work on animated shows: in a 2001 episode of The Simpsons Serena joined the animation along with sister Venus, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi.[444] She has also provided guest voice work in a 2005 episode of Playhouse Disney's animated kids show Higglytown Heroes and a 2007 episode of the Nickelodeon cartoon Avatar: The Last Airbender,[445] which she has described as her "favorite show".[446]
Williams posed for the 2003 and 2004 editions of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.[447] In April 2005, MTV announced plans to broadcast a reality show around the lives of Serena and Venus, which was eventually aired on ABC Family. Williams has appeared twice on MTV's Punk'd and in 2007, appeared in the ABC reality television series Fast Cars and Superstars: The Gillette Young Guns Celebrity Race. In 2002, she played Miss Wiggins in the season 3 episode "Crouching Mother, Hidden Father" of My Wife and Kids;[448] she has also guest-starred in episodes of The Bernie Mac Show, ER and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.[449] In 2007, Williams appeared in the music video of "I Want You" by the American rapper Common, alongside performers Alicia Keys and Kanye West.[450]
In late 2009, Williams became the first active female professional athlete to appear in a feminine hygiene product advertising campaign. A series of online videos and print advertisements for Tampax Pearl tampons showed her hitting balls at Mother Nature, played by Catherine Lloyd Burns, to prevent Mother Nature giving her a red-wrapped gift, representing her menstrual period. In the online videos, the two have dueling press conferences over the "bad blood" between them. "A lot of celebrities are not open to working with our brand, and we're thrilled that Serena is", said a brand manager for Tampax at Procter & Gamble.[451]
In July 2012, she appeared on ABC's comedic improv TV series Trust Us with Your Life and as a lawyer on Lifetime's television series Drop Dead Diva.[citation needed]
To celebrate the 35th anniversary of Pac-Man, Williams made a cameo appearance in the film Pixels, which starred Adam Sandler and Kevin James, and premiered on July 24, 2015.[452]
Williams is known to be close to Beyoncé and made a cameo appearance dancing in Beyoncé's music video for the song Sorry in the hit album Lemonade. Williams said the director told her, "We would love for you to be in this particular song. It's about strength and it's about courage and that's what we see you as."[453]
In 2021, Williams signed a first-look deal with Amazon Studios.[454] She makes a cameo appearance as herself in the 2022 Netflix film Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.[455]

Language fluency
In addition to English as her native language, Williams also speaks conversational French and knows some Spanish and Italian. At the 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2018 French Open she gave her on-court interviews in French much to the crowd's delight.[456][457]

Miami Dolphins venture
In August 2009, Williams and her sister Venus became minority owners of the Miami Dolphins after purchasing a small stake in the team. They live near each other in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida,[249] which is about an hour's drive from the Dolphins' stadium. They are the first black women to hold any amount of ownership in an NFL franchise.[458]

Charity work
In 2004 and 2005, Serena and her sister, Venus, visited hospitals and played several tennis matches in predominantly black cities to raise money for the local Ronald McDonald House charities. An ESPN episode was dedicated to the Williams sisters' charity tour.[441] In 2008, as part of the Serena Williams Foundation's work, Williams helped to fund the construction of the Serena Williams Secondary School in Matooni, Kenya.[459][460][461] The Serena Williams Foundation also provides university scholarships for underprivileged students in the United States. In 2016, the Serena Williams Fund partnered with Helping Hands Jamaica to build the Salt Marsh Primary School for Jamaican youth in Trelawny Parish.[462][463] She received a Celebrity Role Model Award from Avon Foundation in 2003 for work in breast cancer.[464] Williams has also been involved in a number of clinics at schools and community centers, particularly those which have programs focusing on at-risk youth.[1] She has also won the "Young Heroes Award" from Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater L.A. and Inland (2003) and the "Family Circle and Prudential Financial Player Who Makes a Difference Award" (2004).[1] In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Williams, along with other ATP and WTA stars, decided to forgo their final day of preparation for the 2010 Australian Open to form a charity event in which all proceeds would go to the Haiti earthquake victims.[465] Serena, along with her sister Venus, is a supporter and contributor of First Serve Miami, a foundation for youth who want to learn tennis but are socially and economically challenged.[466][467][468][469] She has been an International Goodwill Ambassador with UNICEF since 2011 and has helped launch UNICEF's Schools for Asia campaign.[470][471][472][473]
In addition to the Serena Williams Fund in 2016, Serena and Venus collaborated on the Williams Sisters Fund to work on philanthropic projects together.[474] Also in 2016, in their childhood home of Compton, California Serena and Venus teamed up to found the Yetunde Price Resource Center, in honor of their late sister. The Resource Center provides services to families affected by community violence.[474]
Williams's return to Indian Wells in 2015 was done in partnership with the Equal Justice Initiative, a non-profit organization that provides legal representation to those who might have been denied a fair trial.[475] EJI executive director Bryan Stevenson lauded her courage in supporting his organization. "It's so rare when athletes at the top of their game are willing to embrace a set of issues that, for a lot of people, are edgier", he said. "This is not aid to orphans. ... She was standing when a lot of her contemporaries remain seated, speaking up when others are being quiet."[476]
In 2014, Williams began hosting an annual charity run named "The Serena Williams Ultimate Fun Run". The event is in support of the Serena Williams Fund, which helps underprivileged individuals and communities that are affected by senseless violence and to ensure equal access to education of youth.[477][474][478]
In 2017, Williams became Ambassador for the Allstate Foundation's Purple Purse project, an initiative to provide financial empowerment to domestic abuse victims.[479][480] In a press release, Vicky Dinges, Allstate's senior vice president of corporate responsibility, said, "we are thrilled to welcome Serena, a longtime advocate and role model for so many, to the Purple Purse family. Her voice will bring new audiences into this critical conversation."[480]
Other charitable organizations Williams supports include the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Hearts of Gold, the Common Ground Foundation, the Small Steps Project, the HollyRod Foundation, Beyond the Boroughs National Scholarship Fund, World Education, the Eva Longoria Foundation, the Caliber Foundation and the Cure for MND Foundation.[481][482]

Writing
The Williams sisters, with author Hilary Beard, wrote a book titled Venus & Serena: Serving From The Hip: 10 Rules For Living, Loving and Winning, which was published in 2005.[483][484] During the 2009 Wimbledon Championships, Williams said that she was in the process of writing a TV show storyline, which would be converted into script form by her agency. She stated that the show would represent subject matter from a mix of popular American television shows such as Desperate Housewives and Family Guy.[485] Williams released her first solo autobiography, entitled On the Line, following the 2009 US Open.[citation needed]

Soccer
On July 21, 2020, Williams was announced as part of a nearly all-women investors' group that was awarded a new franchise in the National Women's Soccer League, the top level of the women's sport in the U.S. The new team began play in 2022 as Angel City FC. Her husband Alexis Ohanian is classified as the "lead investor", but he holds a minority interest, and is the only male in the ownership group. Other announced owners include several prominent actresses and media figures, two businesswomen, 14 former members of the U.S. women's national team, and her daughter.[486]

A Toronto rock band is at the top of Serena Williams’ list of all-time favourite music acts.
While speaking about her go-to music with Rolling Stone magazine, the tennis superstar told the publication that she likes to listen to Beyonce, Bruno Mars and The Weeknd for fun “warm up” songs before going on to gush over her love for rock music.

When asked to share a surprising fact about her taste in music, Williams, 41, said people would be surprised to know that she loves listening to the iconic Toronto rock band, Our Lady Peace.
“Oh, I went to the show for Our Lady Peace recently. It was a small show and they literally sounded just like their album and I was like, ‘Oh my god, this is nuts! I love their albums!’,” she gushed.
More specifically, her favourite tracks are “Clumsy” and “Superman’s Dead”.

“I mean, what was I doing singing that song? I didn’t even understand the lyrics. I was like, ‘Serena, you should not be singing this’,” Williams poked fun at her younger self listening to the group’s 1997 hit.
Elsewhere, the 23-Grand Slam holder’s first concert happened to be another famous rock band- Green Day. She attended their Dookie album tour at 14 years old.

Speaking with Rolling Stone about her Super Bowl commercial for Remy Martin, the 23-Grand Slam holder was asked by Canadian journalist Tim Chan what music she listens to before a match.

She listed some pop music singers like Beyonce, Bruno Mars and The Weeknd as fun “warm-up” songs, and then Chan asked the 41-year-old tennis superstar what her first concert was.
At a mere 14 years old, little Serena’s first concert was Green Day as they toured for their Dookie album.
The two chatted about Williams’ love for rock music when Chan asked what people would be surprised to know she listens to.
Lo and behold, Serena listed good ole Toronto group Our Lady Peace.
“Oh, I went to the show for Our Lady Peace recently. It was a small show, and they literally sounded just like their album, and I was like, ‘Oh my god, this is nuts! I love their albums!'” she responded.
Who would’ve thought that the scrappy, decades-old Toronto band would be at the top of the list for the best tennis player in the world?
As a fellow Canadian, Chan got super excited and asked which Our Lady Peace songs were Williams’ favourites.
She replied that she loves “Clumsy” and has always been a fan of “Superman’s Dead.”
“I mean, what was I doing singing that song? I didn’t even understand the lyrics. I was like, ‘Serena, you should not be singing this,'” she told Chan, speaking about the band’s 1997 hit.
From the golden days at MuchMusic’s Indie show to being recognized by one of the best athletes of all time, I’m sure this is a huge career highlight for OLP!

Photos: Tennis Icons Serena And Venus Williams Rock Out At Alice In Chains Concert

It always excites us when we see celebrities from outside the world of metal and rock enjoying some heavy tunes – which is why it is super cool to see tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams rocking out at an Alice In Chains concert!
This Alice In Chains show that the sisters attended took place this past Saturday. While Serena and Venus surely had an awesome time at the show, the band were also excited to meet them! Band singer and rhythm guitarist William DuVall shared a photo involving him and the sisters over on his Instagram, and wrote the following:
“Excellence personified. So honored to have the Williams sisters, @serenawilliams and @venuswilliams, attend our show in West Palm Beach. So great to see them rocking out down front and sidestage. Even better to find that they’re so cool and down to earth as people. Like meeting long lost cousins at a family gathering, only they just happen to be, in my opinion, the best to ever grace a tennis court, as well as being genuine AIC fans. Awesome night.”



Bassist and backing vocalist Mike Inez also shared a photo involving him with Serena and Venus, and wrote the following over on his Instagram:
“Hot and sweaty, soaking, rock and roll gig in West Palm. Nothin’ for nothin’ I always have a great time in Florida. @venuswilliams stood in the front of us singing all the songs and @serenawilliams was on the side with my bass tech. Seemed like everyone needed to rock the fuck out after Hurricane Ian blew through”
It looks like Serena, Venus, and Alice In Chains all had an awesome time! In other band related news, have you heard this version of “Rooster” that only features Layne Staley’s vocals?

Serena Jameka Williams (born September 26, 1981)[1] is an American inactive professional tennis player. Considered among the greatest tennis players of all time,[a] she was ranked world No. 1 in singles by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) for 319 weeks, including a joint-record 186 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. She won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, the most by any player in the Open Era, and the second-most of all time. She is the only player, male or female, to accomplish a Career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles.[19]
Along with her older sister Venus, Serena Williams was coached by her parents Oracene Price and Richard Williams. Turning professional in 1995, she won her first major singles title at the 1999 US Open. From the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open, she was dominant, winning all four major singles titles (each time over Venus in the final) to achieve a non-calendar year Grand Slam and the career Grand Slam, known as the 'Serena Slam'. The next few years saw her claim two more singles majors, but suffer from injury and decline in form. Beginning in 2007, however, she gradually returned to form despite continued injuries, retaking the world No. 1 singles ranking. Beginning at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, Williams returned to dominance, claiming Olympic gold (completing the Career Golden Slam in singles)[20] and winning eight out of thirteen singles majors, including all four in a row from 2014–15 to achieve a second "Serena Slam". At the 2017 Australian Open, she won her 23rd major singles title, surpassing Steffi Graf's Open Era record. She then took a break from professional tennis after becoming pregnant and reached four major finals upon returning to play. In August 2022, Williams announced her impending "evolution" away from professional tennis and played what was expected to be her final match at the 2022 US Open.[21]
Williams also won 14 major women's doubles titles, all with her sister Venus, and the pair was unbeaten in major doubles finals (the best unbeaten record in major finals in any discipline of the sport).[22][23] The pair achieved a non-calendar year Grand Slam between the 2009 Wimbledon Championships and the 2010 French Open, which granted the sisters the doubles world No. 1 ranking. Serena won four Olympic gold medals, three in women's doubles—an all-time joint record in tennis, shared with her sister.[24][25] The duo are the only women in the Open Era to win Olympic gold in both singles and doubles.[26] She also won two major mixed doubles titles, both in 1998. She is the only singles player, male or female, to complete three Career Golden Slams – one in women's singles and two in same-sex doubles.[19]
The arrival of the Williams sisters has been credited with ushering in a new era of power and athleticism on the women's professional tennis tour.[27][28][29][30] Serena holds a combined 39 major titles: 23 in singles, 14 in women's doubles, and two in mixed doubles. She is joint-third on the all-time list and second in the Open Era for total major titles. She is the most recent woman to simultaneously hold all four major singles titles (2002–03 and 2014–15), and the most recent woman to win the Surface Slam (major titles on hard, clay and grass courts in the same calendar year), doing so in 2015. She is also, with Venus, the most recent player to have simultaneously held all four major women's doubles titles (2009–10).
Williams was the world's highest paid woman athlete in 2016, earning almost $29 million.[31] She repeated this feat in 2017 when she was the only woman on Forbes' list of the 100 highest-paid athletes, with $27 million in prize money and endorsements. She won the Laureus Sportswoman of the Year award a record four times (2003, 2010, 2016, 2018), and in December 2015 was named Sportsperson of the Year by Sports Illustrated magazine.[32] She is the highest-earning woman athlete of all time.[33]


Early life
Williams was born on September 26, 1981, in Saginaw, Michigan to Oracene Price and Richard Williams. She is the youngest of Price's five daughters: half-sisters Yetunde, Lyndrea, and Isha Price, and full older sister Venus.[1] She also has at least seven paternal half-siblings.[34][35] When the children were young, the family moved to Compton, California, where she started playing tennis at age four.[36][37] Her father home-schooled her and her sister, Venus.[38][39] While he and subsequently her mother have been their official coaches, her other mentors have included Richard Williams, a Compton man who shared her father's name and subsequently founded The Venus and Serena Williams Tennis Tutorial Academy.[40]

When Williams was nine, she and her family moved from Compton to West Palm Beach, Florida[36] so she could attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci, who provided her with additional coaching. Macci did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls".[41] Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, as he wanted them to "go slowly" and focus on school work. Experiences of racism also influenced this decision, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments.[42] At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida.[43] In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether it would have been more beneficial for them to have followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit, Williams responded, "Everyone does different things. I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us."[43]



Professional career
1995–1998: Professional debut
Williams' parents wanted their daughter to wait until she was 16 to participate in professional tournaments.[44] In 1995, just after turning 14, Williams planned to make her professional debut as a wild-card entry in the Bank of the West Classic in Oakland, California, but was denied by the WTA owing to their age-eligibility restrictions.[45] She subsequently filed an antitrust lawsuit against the women's tour, but withdrew it at her parents' request.[45] Her first professional event was in October 1995 at the Bell Challenge in Quebec,[44][46] where she used a wild-card entry to circumvent age-eligibility rules.[44] She lost in the first qualifying round to then 18-year-old American Annie Miller, winning just two games.[47]
Williams did not play a tournament in 1996. The next year, she lost in the qualifying rounds of three tournaments,[48] before winning her first main-draw match in November at the Ameritech Cup Chicago.[49] Ranked No. 304, she upset No. 7 Mary Pierce, and No. 4 Monica Seles,[50][51] recording her first career wins over top 10 players and becoming the lowest-ranked player in the Open Era to defeat two top-10 opponents in one tournament.[1] She ultimately lost in the semifinals to No. 5 Lindsay Davenport.[52] She finished 1997 ranked No. 99.[53]
Williams began 1998 at the Medibank International Sydney.[54] As a qualifier ranked No. 96,[55] she defeated No. 3 Davenport in the quarterfinals,[55] before losing to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in the semifinals.[56] Williams made her debut in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament at the Australian Open,[57] where she defeated sixth-seeded Irina Spîrlea in the first round,[58] before losing to her sister, Venus, in the second round in the sisters' first professional match.[58][54] She reached six other quarterfinals during the year, but lost all of them,[59] including her first match against No. 1-ranked Martina Hingis at the Lipton International Players Championships in Key Biscayne,[60] and her second match against Venus at the Italian Open in Rome.[59] She failed to reach the quarterfinals of any Grand Slam tournament the remainder of the year,[citation needed] losing in the fourth round of the French Open to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario,[61] and the third round of the US Open to Spîrlea.[62] She withdrew from Wimbledon two games into a match with Virginia Ruano Pascual, after straining a calf muscle during the first set.[63] She did win the mixed doubles titles at Wimbledon and the US Open with Max Mirnyi, completing the Williams family's sweep of the 1998 mixed doubles Grand Slam tournaments. She won her first professional title in doubles at the U.S. National Indoor Championships in Oklahoma City with Venus, becoming the third pair of sisters to win a WTA title.[1] They won two more doubles titles that year. Williams finished the year ranked No. 20 in singles.[citation needed]

Battle of the sexes: Karsten Braasch vs. the Williams sisters
Main article: Battle of the Sexes (tennis)
A 16-year-old Serena and her sister Venus competed in a tennis "Battle of the Sexes" against Karsten Braasch at the 1998 Australian Open.[64] At the time Braasch was 203rd in the ATP rankings. The sisters had claimed they could beat any man outside the top 200, and accepted his challenge. Braasch beat both of them, playing one set against each. The score versus Serena was 6–1 and 6–2 against Venus.[65] Braasch said afterward, "500 and above, no chance." The sisters later tweaked the number to beating men outside the top 350.[66]

1999–2001: Becoming a top-10 player
Williams lost in the third round of the 1999 Australian Open to Sandrine Testud. A month later, Williams won her first professional singles title when she defeated Amélie Mauresmo in the final of the Open Gaz de France in Paris. With Venus also winning the IGA Superthrift Classic in Memphis, Tennessee, that day, the pair became the first sisters to win professional tournaments in the same week.[67] In March of that year, at the Evert Cup in California, Williams won her first Tier I title, defeating Steffi Graf in the final. Soon afterward at the Miami Masters, Williams had her 16-match winning streak ended by her sister in the first all-sister singles final in WTA history,[54] and she then made her top-10 debut, at No. 9. She then lost in the quarterfinals of the Italian Open[68] and the German Open,[69] and the third round of the French Open,[70] where she and Venus won the women's doubles title.[54] Williams then missed Wimbledon because of injury. When she returned to the tour, Williams won a Fed Cup singles match and then won the JPMorgan Chase Open in Los Angeles, beating Julie Halard-Decugis in the final. She then defeated in succession Grand Slam champions Kim Clijsters, Conchita Martínez, Monica Seles, and defending champion Lindsay Davenport to reach the US Open final, where she defeated No. 1, Hingis, to become the second African-American woman, after Althea Gibson in 1958, to win a Grand Slam singles tournament.[1] The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at this tournament. To complete her 1999 season, Williams won a doubles match in the Fed Cup final against Russia. Williams ended the year ranked No. 4 in just her second full year on the main tour.[71]
Williams started 2000 by losing in the fourth round of the Australian Open to Elena Likhovtseva. She failed to defend her titles in Paris and Indian Wells, although she did win the Faber Grand Prix in Germany. Soon afterwards, Williams missed the French Open because of injury. She returned from injury at the Wimbledon Championships, where she lost to Venus in the semifinals, but the pair won the doubles title at the event. Williams successfully defended her title in Los Angeles, defeating Davenport in the final. She reached the final of the Du Maurier Open where an injury forced her to retire from her match with Hingis. Her defense of the US Open title ended when she lost in the quarterfinals to Davenport. Williams teamed with Venus to win the gold medal in doubles at the Sydney Olympics that September. She ended the year winning the Toyota Princess Cup in Japan and she finished the year ranked No. 6.[citation needed]
Williams began 2001 losing to Martina Hingis in the quarterfinals of the Medibank International in Sydney and the Australian Open in Melbourne. Williams and her sister won the doubles title at the latter tournament, becoming only the fifth doubles team in history to win all four Grand Slam women's doubles titles during their career, completing a "Career Grand Slam". Her next event was the Pacific Life Open in California, where she defeated Kim Clijsters in the final. The final was marred by the behavior of the crowd toward Williams and her family. Crowd members were incensed at the perceived match-fixing of games involving the family after Venus withdrew before their semifinal. Neither Williams nor her sister entered the tournament for fourteen years until Williams entered in 2015 as a wildcard (and the top seed).[72] The following week at the Ericsson Open in Miami, Williams lost to Jennifer Capriati in the quarterfinals. She then lost in the quarterfinals to Capriati at both the French Open and Wimbledon Championships. That was the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament at which Williams had exited in the quarterfinals. During the North American hard-court season, she lost in the quarterfinals of Los Angeles against Monica Seles, then captured her second title of the year at the Rogers Cup, defeating Capriati in the final. Williams reached the final of the 2001 US Open, losing to sister Venus. That was the first Grand Slam tournament final contested by two sisters during the Open Era. At the 2001 season-ending Tour Championships, Williams won the championship by walkover when Davenport withdrew before the start of the final because of a knee injury. Williams finished 2001 at No. 6 for the second straight year.[citation needed]

2002–2003: "Serena Slam"
Early 2002, injury saw Williams retire from the semifinal at the Medibank International Sydney and later withdraw from the Australian Open.[73]  Playing Amélie Mauresmo in the quarterfinals of the tournament in Sydney in 2002
Returning from injury, Williams won her first title of the year in Scottsdale, Arizona, defeating No. 2 Jennifer Capriati, in the final. She then won the Miami Masters for the first time, becoming one of three players in the Open Era to defeat the world's top 3 ranked players at one tournament,[1] after beating No. 3, Martina Hingis, in the quarterfinals, No. 2 Venus in the semifinals, and the top-ranked player, Capriati, in the final. Serena's straight set win over Venus was her second career win over her sister.[citation needed]
Williams played three clay-court tournaments before the 2002 French Open. Her first tournament was at Charleston, where she was the third seed. Williams reached the quarterfinals before losing to Patty Schnyder. She reached her first clay-court final in May, at the Eurocard German Open losing to Justine Henin in a third set tiebreak. Williams went on to win her first clay court title at the Italian Open, defeating Capriati in the semifinals and Henin in the final.[74] This raised her ranking to a new high of No. 3. Williams was the third seed at the French Open at Roland Garros, where she claimed her first title thereby defeating defending champion Capriati in the semifinals and sister Venus in the final to win her second Grand Slam tournament title (and her first in two-and-a-half years). As a result of raising the trophy at Court Philippe Chatrier, Williams rose to a career-high of No. 2, second only to Venus.[citation needed]
At the 2002 Wimbledon Championships, Williams won tennis's oldest championship for the first time in her life, defeating Venus to win a Grand Slam singles title without dropping a set for the first time in her career. This victory earned Williams the world No. 1 ranking for the first time, dethroning her sister and becoming only the third African American woman to hold that ranking.[1] The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at the tournament, the fifth Grand Slam doubles title for the pair. Williams played just one tournament between Wimbledon and the US Open, losing in the quarterfinals of the JPMorgan Chase Open in Los Angeles to American Chanda Rubin and ending a 21-match winning streak. The top-seeded player at the US Open, Williams reached the final where, for the third Grand Slam in a row, she defeated her sister to win the title, the second US Open crown of her career. Williams won two consecutive singles titles in the fall, defeating Kim Clijsters to win the Toyota Princess Cup in Tokyo, and Anastasia Myskina to win the Sparkassen Cup in Leipzig, Germany. She reached the final at the year-end Home Depot Championships at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, where she lost to fifth-seeded Clijsters in straight sets, ending an 18-match winning streak.[citation needed]
Williams finished 2002 with a 56–5 W/L record, eight singles titles, and the No. 1 ranking. She was the first African-American to end a year with that ranking since Althea Gibson in 1958[citation needed] and was the first woman to win three Grand Slam tournament titles in one year since Hingis in 1997.[1] Her three consecutive Grand Slam titles to close 2002 also made Williams only the third player in tennis history to win the "Surface Slam",[75] three Slam titles on three surfaces in the same calendar year, after Navratilova (1984) and Graf (1993, 1995, 1996).[citation needed]
At the 2003 Australian Open, Williams reached the tournament's semifinals for the first time, where she recovered from 5–1 down in the third set and saved two match points before defeating Clijsters. In the final, Serena faced Venus for the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament final, defeating her older sister to become the sixth woman in the Open Era to complete a career Grand Slam, alongside Margaret Court, Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Steffi Graf. She also became the fifth woman to hold all Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously, joining Maureen Connolly Brinker, Court, Graf, and Navratilova. This feat was dubbed the "Serena Slam" by the press.[76][77] The Williams sisters won their sixth Grand Slam doubles title together at this event.[78]
During the spring of 2003, Williams captured the singles titles at the Open Gaz de France and the Sony Ericsson Open. Williams's winning streak came to an end when she lost the final of the Family Circle Cup to Henin, her first loss of the year after 21 wins. She also lost to Mauresmo in the semifinals of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome. Despite these losses, Williams was the top seed at the French Open, where she lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Henin, marking Williams's first loss in a Grand Slam tournament since 2001. The match was controversial, as Williams questioned Henin's sportsmanship, and spectators applauded Williams's errors.[79] Williams rebounded from the French Open loss a couple weeks later at the 2003 Wimbledon Championships, defeating Henin in the semifinals and Venus in the final. This was Williams's second consecutive Wimbledon title and her sixth Grand Slam singles title overall. Wimbledon was Williams's last tournament of 2003; she pulled out of three events in the US and then underwent surgery on the quadriceps tendon in her knee in early August. Williams was initially expected to be out for six to eight weeks.[80]

2004–2007: Injuries and the comeback
Main articles: 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 Serena Williams tennis season
After eight months away from the tour, during which time her desire was questioned,[81] Williams began her comeback at the 2004 NASDAQ-100 Open in Miami in March, where she made a triumphant return as she won the title for the third consecutive year. Delivering a serve at an exhibition in November 2004
Although ranked No. 7, Williams was seeded second at the French Open, where, after winning four matches, she lost to Capriati in the quarterfinals. That was the first time that Williams had lost before the semifinals at a Grand Slam singles tournament since Wimbledon in 2001. A few weeks later, even though her ranking had dropped to No. 10, Williams was seeded first at Wimbledon. She won six matches en route to the final, where 13th-seeded Maria Sharapova defeated her in straight sets. This loss caused her ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the first time since 1999. Later that summer, Williams reached her third final of the year at the JPMorgan Chase Open in Los Angeles where she lost to Lindsay Davenport which was her first loss to the American since the 2000 US Open. After missing her national championship in 2003, Williams returned for the 2004 US Open, where she was seeded third despite her No. 11 ranking. She lost in the U.S. Open quarterfinals to Capriati in three sets in controversial fashion.[82] That fall, Williams won her second title of the year, at the China Open, defeating US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the final. Williams's successful season allowed her to qualify for the Tour Championships, held again in Los Angeles. In the round-robin phase of the tournament, Williams defeated Dementieva and Anastasia Myskina and lost to Davenport, but still advanced to the elimination stage. After winning her semifinal, she lost to Sharapova in the final, where she suffered an abdominal injury.[83] Williams finished 2004 ranked No. 7, but did not win a Grand Slam singles tournament for the first season since 2001.[citation needed]
At the 2005 Australian Open, Williams rejected suggestions that she and sister Venus were a declining force in tennis, following Venus's early exit.[84] Williams saved three match points to defeat Sharapova 8–6 in the third of their semifinal. In the final, Williams defeated top seed Davenport to win her second Australian Open and seventh Grand Slam singles title, winning 12 of the last 15 games.[85] The win moved Williams back to No. 2 but stated she was targeting the top spot.[86]
Williams completed just two tournaments between the Australian Open and Wimbledon, losing to Venus in Miami and at Internazionali BNL d'Italia to Francesca Schiavone as Williams suffered a series of retirements and withdraws.[87][88] A reoccurring ankle injury causing her to miss the French Open.[89] She returned for Wimbledon as the 4th-seeded player, but was defeated in the third round by No. 85, Jill Craybas. At the US Open, Williams lost to her sister Venus in the fourth round. This was the earliest the sisters had met in a Grand Slam tournament since their first meeting, at the 1998 Australian Open. Williams played just one more match that fall, a loss to No. 127 Sun Tiantian at the tournament in Beijing. She failed to qualify for the year-end championship for the first time since 1998 and she finished the year 2005 ranked No. 11, her first time finishing the season outside the top 10 since 1998.[citation needed]
Williams made her 2006 debut at the Australian Open. Defending the title, Williams lost to Daniela Hantuchová in the third round.[90] After the tournament, she told the press that she was injured, blaming a lack of fitness and a knee injury for keeping her off the court.[91] In her biography, Williams claims that she was actually suffering from depression. She stayed away from pro tennis for six months during the 2006 season. After she had shut herself off from the world for a period, Williams saw a therapist daily.[92] After a chance meeting with a young girl who idolized Williams and believed that she could still win, Williams signed up to play in Cincinnati,[93] her first tournament since Melbourne. Williams had slipped to No. 139, the lowest ranking she had held since 1997. On her return, Williams defeated Myskina and Bethanie Mattek,[94][95] before losing in the semifinals to Vera Zvonareva.[96] She also reached the semifinals in Los Angeles, losing to Janković in straight sets. At the US Open, Williams needed a wildcard to enter the tournament, as her ranking at the cut-off time was No. 139, outside the automatic 102. Her ranking had improved to 79th by the time the tournament came around.[97] She lost to top-seeded Mauresmo in the fourth round.[98] Following the US Open, she did not play again in 2006, ending the year ranked No. 95, her lowest year-end ranking since 1997.[citation needed]
Williams began 2007 with renewed confidence, stating her intention to return to the top of the rankings,[99] a comment 1987 Wimbledon men's singles champion and commentator Pat Cash branded "deluded".[100]
Williams lost in the quarterfinals of the Hobart International, a warm-up for the Australian Open where Williams was unseeded because of her No. 81 ranking and was widely regarded as "out of shape".[101] She experienced a huge amount of pressure on herself before the tournament, coming from her fans and the press as well as Williams herself about her weight, focus and needing a good showing.[citation needed]
Shortly before her first match, a representative from Nike paid her a visit in the players' lounge, informing her that if she did not perform to her accustomed level, the company might drop her. Williams claimed that Nike's ultimatum meant that she would have to reach the quarterfinals at least.[102]
The distraction from Nike did not distract Williams, as she lost just three games to Mara Santangelo and defeated Anne Kremer in straight sets.[103] By this point, a blister had developed on Williams's foot and she had contracted a cold. In the third round, Williams found herself two points away from going home against Nadia Petrova, but fought back to win in three sets, which was her first win over a top-10 player since defeating Lindsay Davenport in the 2005 Australian Open final. Williams then made it to the final, defeating Janković, Pe'er and Vaidišová. Williams described them as "good players. Strong players. Players who certainly didn't expect an overweight, out-of-shape, has been champion like me to give them a game."[104] Williams also found herself two points from going out against Peer before turning it around.[105] By the time Williams had reached the final, the cold and blister had both left. Previewing the finals, Tracy Austin stated that, although Williams had a great tournament, she believed that the ride was over and that Sharapova would have no trouble with Williams. Williams thought it was mean and unnecessary and used it as motivation along with other criticism.[106] In the final, Williams lost just three games against Maria Sharapova, winning her first title at any tournament since winning the 2005 Australian Open 24 months prior.[105] Williams became the first player since Chris O'Neil to win the title while not being seeded, and claimed her third Australian Open and eighth Grand Slam singles title overall. The win elevated Williams to 14th in the rankings. Williams dedicated the title to her deceased half-sister Yetunde.[107] Her performance in the final was described in the press as "one of the best performances of her career" and "arguably the most powerful display ever seen in women's tennis".[101][108] In her post-match interview, Williams took a swipe at her critics, stating that she had proved them wrong.[109] Williams won the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami for the fourth time by defeating Justine Henin. Williams had to record a come-from-behind win after being whitewashed in the first set and saving two match points in the second.[110] She played for her country in the Fed Cup for the first time since 2003 in a tie against Belgium, and won her opening match[111] but withdrew from her second, because of a knee injury.[112]
At the French Open, Williams lost in the quarterfinals to Henin.[113] During her fourth round match against Hantuchová at Wimbledon, Williams collapsed from an acute muscle spasm at 5–5 in the second set. After a medical timeout and holding serve to force a tiebreak, rain forced play to be suspended for nearly two hours. When the players returned, Williams won the match in three sets.[114] Williams then lost her quarterfinal match with Henin, whilst suffering from the injuries sustained in the previous round.[115] At the US Open, Williams lost her third consecutive Grand Slam singles quarterfinal to Henin.[116] Williams reached the final of Kremlin Cup, losing to Elena Dementieva. Williams qualified for the WTA Championships, but retired from her first match with Anna Chakvetadze with a knee injury and subsequently withdrew from the event.[117][118] Williams finished 2007 as No. 7 and the top-ranked American for the first time since 2003.[113]

She also broke the record previously set by Justine Henin for the most prize money earned by a female tennis player in one year, with Williams earning $6,545,586. For doubles that year, the Williams sisters finished the year ranked No. 2, despite playing only six tournaments together as a pair. Williams had won five Grand Slam tournament titles, putting her total of Grand Slam titles won thus far at 23, and she was consequently named Female Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press for 2009.[126] Williams was also the ITF World Champion in both the singles and doubles events.[127]
In 2010, Williams's first scheduled tournament was in Sydney, losing in the final to Elena Dementieva. At the Australian Open, Williams was the defending champion in both singles and doubles. She reached the final and defeated Justine Henin, who had just recently come out of retirement, for her twelfth Grand Slam singles title. In doubles, Williams and her sister, Venus, successfully defended their title by defeating Cara Black and Liezel Huber in the final.[citation needed]
Williams withdrew with a leg injury from her next few events,[citation needed] and returned at the Rome Masters, losing to Jelena Janković in the semifinals. At Madrid, she fell to Nadia Petrova in the third round but partnered Venus to win the doubles title.[citation needed]
At the French Open, Williams was defeated by Samantha Stosur in the quarterfinals. She and Venus were the top seeds in the doubles event and won the title, defeating Květa Peschke and Katarina Srebotnik in the final to win their fourth consecutive Grand Slam doubles title and improving their doubles ranking to No. 1.[citation needed]
Williams's next tournament was Wimbledon, where she defeated Russian Vera Zvonareva in the final without facing a break point and breaking the serve of Zvonareva three times.[128][129] She did not lose a set in the tournament.[130]
After the match, Martina Navratilova said that Williams is in the top five of all the women's tennis players in all of history, which she said that "it's not just about how many Slams you win or how many tournaments you win—it's just your game overall. And she's got all the goods."[129] Serena was the defending champion in doubles with her sister Venus, winning the last two years. They lost in the quarterfinals to Elena Vesnina and Zvonareva. In Munich on July 7, Williams stepped on broken glass while in a restaurant, and the injury caused her to miss the rest of the year.[citation needed]
Williams ended the year ranked No. 4 in singles after six tournaments,[citation needed] and No. 11 in doubles after four tournaments.[citation needed]
On March 2, 2011, she confirmed that she had suffered a hematoma and a pulmonary embolism.[131][132][133]

2011–2013: Return to dominance, career golden slam
Main articles: 2011, 2012, and 2013 Serena Williams tennis season
 Williams won the singles gold medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
 Williams at the 2013 US Open
Williams finally made a return to the practice court in March 2011.[134] She made her first appearance on the WTA tour in almost a year in Eastbourne.[135] Williams lost in round two to Vera Zvonareva in a match that lasted over three hours.[136] Her next tournament was Wimbledon, where she was the defending champion. She reached the round of 16, where she lost to Marion Bartoli. After the loss, her ranking dropped to 169. Williams won her first titles since her return to tennis triumphing in Stanford and Toronto. At the Western & Southern Open, Williams defeated Lucie Hradecká, only to withdraw the next day, citing a right toe injury. She then played at the US Open going all the way to the final and losing to Samantha Stosur during a match which featured her verbally abusing the chair umpire. The US Open final turned out to be Williams's last match in 2011, and she ended the year ranked No. 12 with two titles and with a 22–3 record for the season. She only participated in six tournaments throughout the season.
Williams started the 2012 season at the Brisbane International, however, during her match against Bojana Jovanovski, she injured her left ankle when serving for the match. As a result, Williams was forced to withdraw from the tournament.[137] Next she participated at the Australian Open where she was upset by Ekaterina Makarova in the fourth round. After a month layoff, Williams returned to competition in Miami losing in the quarterfinals to Caroline Wozniacki. Williams then won consecutive titles at Charleston and Madrid beating Lucie Šafářová and Victoria Azarenka, but withdrew from her semifinal match against Li Na in Rome citing a lower back injury. Williams suffered her first ever loss in the opening round of a Grand Slam tournament at the French Open against Virginie Razzano. Williams notched up a 33–1 record for the second half of the season winning five titles in the process.[138] Williams won her fifth Wimbledon singles title, her fourteenth Grand Slam title;[139][140] setting a serving record of 24 aces by a woman in a match as well as having the most aces, male or female, during the tournament (102).[141] Williams returned to America to successfully defend her title in Stanford beating CoCo Vandeweghe in the final.[142][143] Williams then returned to Wimbledon to represent her country at the Olympic Games where she won gold, defeating Maria Sharapova in a dominating performance. Williams failed to drop more than three games per set en route to winning the medal.[143] Williams undefeated streak ended with a loss in Cincinnati to Angelique Kerber. In New York City, Williams went on to win her fourth US Open singles title and her 15th career Grand Slam title overall beating Azarenka in the final.[138][144] Williams ended the season by competing at the WTA Championships and went undefeated throughout the tournament to win the event for her third title.[138] Williams was voted WTA Player of the Year for the fourth time.[145] Based on her brilliant show in 2012, Williams was also named International Tennis Federation World Champion.[146] Williams also returned to doubles competitions with Venus; in the pair's first tournament since 2010 Wimbledon, they claimed their fifth Wimbledon doubles title and the 13th grand slam doubles title.[147] The pair successfully defended their Olympic doubles title which meant that they became the only tennis players to win four gold medals.[148]
Williams's first tournament of the 2013 season was in Brisbane, where she won the title without dropping a set. Williams was upset in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open by fellow American player Sloane Stephens. By virtue of defeating Petra Kvitová in Doha, Williams returned to the No. 1 position for the sixth time in her career and became the oldest woman in the Open Era to hold the ranking.[149] Williams went on to lose to Victoria Azarenka in the final. In the Miami final, Williams lost a set to Maria Sharapova for the first time since 2008. This setback did not stop Williams who recorded her 70th come-from-behind win. The win made Williams a six-time champion in Miami breaking the record she held with Steffi Graf and became only the fourth woman in the Open Era to have won a tournament at least six times.[150] Williams successfully defended her Charleston title, winning it for the third time overall.[151] Williams won her fiftieth career singles title in Madrid, defeating Sharapova in the final. Williams then played Rome, where she won the title without dropping a set, defeating Victoria Azarenka in the final to take her second title. Williams only dropped ten games in reaching the quarterfinals at Roland Garros. There, she played Svetlana Kuznetsova and lost her first set of the tournament. In the semifinal, Williams only lost one game when she defeated Sara Errani, something seven-time French Open champion Chris Evert described as the finest woman performance on clay she had ever seen.[152] Williams defeated Sharapova to claim her second Roland Garros title, her sixteenth grand slam tournament title overall. She became the fourth woman in the Open Era after Navratilova, Evert and Graf to win each Grand Slam tournament title on at least two occasions. At Wimbledon, she advanced easily to the fourth round before being upset by eventual finalist Sabine Lisicki in three sets. After Wimbledon, Williams won the Swedish Open by defeating Johanna Larsson in the final, the tournament win marked the first occasion that she had won an International level title. By winning the tournament this meant that Williams had managed to be undefeated on clay during the season.[153]

 Williams winning her fifth US Open title
Williams won her 3rd Rogers Cup title in Toronto beating Sorana Cîrstea in the final.[154] Williams reached the final of the Western & Southern Open for the first time but lost to Azarenka.[155] At the US Open, Williams began as top seed and defending champion. She reached the final—a rematch of the 2012 final against Azarenka—and won in three sets, capturing her 17th Grand Slam singles title.[156] Williams became the oldest US Open champion in the Open Era and pushed her career prize money past $50 million.[156] After the US Open, Williams beat Jelena Janković to win the China Open in Beijing for her 10th title of 2013.[157][158] Williams went through the WTA Championships undefeated winning the final against Li Na, to become the first person to defend the title since Justine Henin in 2007. Williams won her 11th title of 2013 becoming the 8th player to win 11 titles or more in a year and the first since Martina Hingis in 1997.[159] Also, she became the oldest person to win the WTA Championships and 4th player to win it 4 times or more. By winning the championship, Williams became the first woman to win more than $10 million in a season and with her total of $12,385,572, only Rafael Nadal, in 2013, and Novak Djokovic, in 2011, 2012 and 2013, have earned more money in one season.[160]
Williams finished as the year end No. 1 for the third time, becoming the oldest No. 1 player in WTA history.[161] She was also named the 2013 ITF World Champion, the fourth time that she received the World Champion's crown.[162] Williams received two prizes at the 2013 ESPY Awards. Williams won Best Female Athlete and Best Female Tennis Player. Williams is just the fourth person to win Best Female Athlete on two occasions and she won Best Female Tennis player for a record sixth time.[163] In late December 2013, Williams capped off her year by receiving the Associated Press 2013 Female Athlete of the Year award, her third AP award after 2002 and 2009. Only two women, Chris Evert and Babe Didrikson, have been chosen more often as AP Athlete of the Year since the annual awards were first handed out in 1931.[164]

2014–2015: Second 'Serena Slam'
Main articles: 2014 and 2015 Serena Williams tennis season
Williams defended her title at the Brisbane International by defeating No. 2, Victoria Azarenka, in the final.[165] At the Australian Open she ended up losing to former No. 1, Ana Ivanovic, in the fourth round. At Dubai, Williams lost her semifinal match to Alizé Cornet in straight sets. Williams next headed to the Miami Open where she won her record seventh title with a straight-sets victory over No. 2 Li Na.[166] Williams lost to Jana Čepelová in the second round of the Family Circle Cup. She made it to the quarterfinals at the Madrid Open before withdrawing with a left thigh injury. Williams won her third title of the season at the Rome. She was then handed the worst loss of her Grand Slam tournament career by Garbiñe Muguruza at the second round of the French Open, who defeated Serena losing just four games in two sets.[167] Alizé Cornet defeated Williams for the second time in the year in the third round of Wimbledon, thus handing Williams her earliest Wimbledon exit since 2005. Serena was then forced to withdraw from the doubles event alongside sister Venus while trailing 0–3 in the second round. A disoriented Serena hit 4 consecutive doubles faults and was having trouble with both her ball toss and movement before being removed from what has been described as one of the most unusual scenes ever seen in tennis.[168][169]
Williams rebounded by winning 19 out of her next 20 matches (losing only to sister Venus in the semifinals of the Rogers Cup). This streak include titles at the Bank of the West Classic as well as her first Western & Southern Open title and her third consecutive and sixth overall US Open singles title which she won without having dropped a set.[170][171] With this victory Williams tied Chris Evert for most singles titles won by a woman at the US Open in the Open Era. Williams also tied Evert and Navratilova's 18 Grand Slam singles titles won in the Open Era. By virtue of having won both the US Open and the US Open Series, Williams collected $4,000,000 – the biggest payday in tennis history. At the Wuhan Open a viral illness forced her to retire while up a break in the first set against Alizé Cornet. Cornet thus became the first woman since Justine Henin in 2007 to record three victories over Williams in one year. At the China Open Williams retired prior to her quarterfinal match versus Samantha Stosur. At the 2014 WTA Finals in Singapore Williams advanced to the final for the third consecutive year despite having equaled her career-worst loss in her second round robin match versus Simona Halep.[172] Williams won her fifth WTA Finals title by avenging her loss to Halep in the championship match for her seventh title of the year.[173] Williams finished the year ranked No. 1 for the fourth time in her career. She held the No. 1 ranking for the entire calendar year, a feat not accomplished since Steffi Graf in 1996. She was also voted WTA Player of the Year and ITF World Champion for a third consecutive year (sixth overall).[citation needed]
Williams began the 2015 season by representing the United States alongside John Isner at the Hopman Cup. The American pair lost the final to the Poland.[174] At the Australian Open Williams defeated Maria Sharapova for the 16th consecutive time to claim her 6th Australian Open singles title and 19th career Grand Slam singles title, winning the title on her third match point in the second set.[175][176][177][178][179] With this victory Williams surpassed both, Evert and Navratilova, for second most Grand Slam singles titles won in the Open Era. The title was also her sixth Grand Slam singles title since turning 30 years of age, three more than the next closest to do so (Margaret Court, Martina Navratilova with three each). She is the only player in history to win all four Grand Slams at least once after having turned 30. The following weekend, Serena and sister Venus traveled to Buenos Aires to face Argentina in a World Group II tie for Fed Cup. She played and won her only match against María Irigoyen to help Team USA to a 4–1 win over Argentina.[180] Williams announced that she would be competing at the Indian Wells Masters ending her 14-year boycott of the event.[181][182] Upon her return Williams received a standing ovation from the crowd and won her first match in straight sets.[183] She reached the semifinals, where she was due to face No. 3, Simona Halep, for a place in the final, but was forced to withdraw because of a knee injury. By virtue of having defeated Sabine Lisicki in the quarterfinals of the Miami Open, Williams became only the eighth woman in the Open Era to record 700 match wins in her career.[184] This also made her one of only three active players to have won 700 or more matches in singles, others being Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.[185] In the semifinals she won against Halep to advance to her tenth final at the event[186] where she won a record eighth title and extended her winning streak to 21 by beating Carla Suárez Navarro.[187][188][189]

 Williams celebrating her third French Open title
As preparation for the clay court season (and to ensure her eligibility for the 2016 Summer Olympics), Williams travelled to Brindisi, Italy, to face Italy's team for a place in the Fed Cup's World Group. Williams lost the decisive doubles match alongside Alison Riske to Sara Errani and Flavia Pennetta, and as a result the United States team were relegated to World Group II. It was Williams's first loss in the Fed Cup.[190] She maintained her perfect record in singles by defeating Camila Giorgi and Errani. The week of April 20 marked Williams's 114th consecutive week ranked No. 1, the third-longest run in WTA history, behind Steffi Graf's 186 weeks and Navratilova's 156.[citation needed] Williams suffered her first defeat of the season in the semifinals of the Mutua Madrid Open to No. 4, Petra Kvitová.[191][192] This loss ended a 27-match winning streak for Williams as well as a 50-match winning streak at Premier-Mandatory events, and also a 19-match winning streak at the particular event.[193] Williams played one match at the 2015 Internazionali BNL d'Italia before withdrawing from the tournament with an elbow injury.[194]
By virtue of having defeated Victoria Azarenka in the third round of the French Open, Williams became the first woman in the Open Era to win 50 matches at all four of the Grand Slams.[195] Williams then defeated Sloane Stephens to reach her 40th Grand Slam singles quarterfinal.[196] Williams won her next match easily, but had to come back from a set down in the semifinals versus Timea Bacsinszky for the fourth time in five matches to reach the final.[197][198] She would go on to defeat Lucie Šafářová from the Czech Republic in three sets to win her third French Open and 20th Grand Slam singles title.[199][200][201]
The win made Williams only the third person in history to win each Grand Slam at least three times, joining Margaret Court and Steffi Graf. She is the first player to win three straight Grand Slams since she did it herself during the Serena Slam. She also became the first player to win the Australian-French Open double since Jennifer Capriati in 2001.[202]
Williams completed her second "Serena Slam" (winning all four Grand Slams in a row) by winning the 2015 Wimbledon Championships – her 6th Wimbledon and 21st Grand Slam singles title overall.[203][204] Her path to victory at Wimbledon was particularly challenging. She was down a double break in the third round versus Heather Watson and two points from defeat twice before rallying for the win[205] and becoming the first player to qualify for the WTA Finals[206] (the earliest that a player had qualified since the event switched to the round-robin format in 2003). Williams then defeated three former No. 1 players–Venus Williams, Victoria Azarenka and Maria Sharapova—in succession to advance to the final.[207] Awaiting her there was 21-year-old Garbiñe Muguruza, who had previously handed Williams the worst Grand Slam tournament defeat of her career at the 2014 French Open.[208] Williams defeated Muguruza in a tight two-setter.[citation needed]
The victory made Williams the oldest woman in the Open Era to win a grand slam singles title, in addition to having the distinction of being the oldest ladies' grand slam singles champion of all time.[209] It also was her eighth consecutive victory in Grand Slam singles finals appearances, breaking Steffi Graf's Open Era record of seven from 1995 through 1999 and, on the men's side, tying Pete Sampras's Open Era record of eight from 1995 through 2000. Her 21st Grand Slam singles titles equaled the tally of the rest of the women's tour, combined.[210] The week of July 13 marked the first time in WTA history that the No. 1 player had more than twice as many points as No. 2.[211] Following her win at Wimbledon, Williams was awarded her 7th ESPY for Best Female Tennis Player.[212]
Williams played one match at the Swedish Open in Båstad before withdrawing with an elbow injury.[213] She was the defending champion at the Bank of the West Classic but withdrew from the tournament in order for her elbow to get better.[214] Williams had her 19 match winning streak ended by 18-year-old Swiss Belinda Bencic, the No. 20, in three tight sets in the semifinals of the Canadian Open.[215][216] It was her second defeat of the year and first on hard courts since the 2014 WTA Finals. The next week Williams defended her title at the Western & Southern Open with a straight sets victory over No. 3 Simona Halep for her 69th WTA title, breaking a tie with Evonne Goolagong for standalone fifth-most WTA titles won.[217][218] Williams's attempt at capturing the "Grand Slam" (winning all four Grand Slams in a calendar year) came to an end in the semifinals of the US Open, where she lost to Roberta Vinci in three sets.[219][220][221] The loss has been described by some as one of the biggest upsets in tennis history.[222][223][224] Nonetheless, Williams secured the year-end No. 1 ranking with her results at the tournament.[225] On October 1, Williams called an end to her season, stating that she had been injured for most of the year and wanted to address her fitness issues.[226] Prior to the announcement, coach Patrick Mouratoglou hinted that Williams might not play again in 2015 owing to a lack of motivation and disappointment following her loss at the Open.[227] On October 5, Williams surpassed Chris Evert for third-most weeks ranked world No. 1.[228] Williams held the No. 1 ranking the entire season for the second consecutive year, finishing there for the fifth time in her career. She was voted WTA Player of the Year for the seventh time in her career.[229] On December 14, Sports Illustrated announced Williams as their Sportsperson of the Year.[230] She thus became the third solo woman, and first since 1983, to receive the award.[231] Williams was also named ITF World Champion for the sixth time in her career.[232] Soon after, it was announced that she was voted Female Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press for the fourth time.[233]

2016: Open Era Grand Slam record
Main article: 2016 Serena Williams tennis season
Williams withdrew from the Hopman Cup after retiring from her singles match against Australia Gold with inflammation of her left knee.[234] Her next tournament was the Australian Open, where she was the No. 1 seed and defending champion. She reached the final without dropping a set, including wins over No. 5, Maria Sharapova, and No. 4, Agnieszka Radwańska, and faced first time Grand Slam finalist Angelique Kerber. She was considered the heavy favorite to win the title, as she had never lost an Australian Open final or semifinal. She also dominated the head-to-head against Kerber, having lost only once in six meetings and having not lost a set to her in four years. Williams lost the final in three sets and Kerber won her first Grand Slam title.[235] This marked Williams's first-ever loss in the final of the Australian Open, as well as her first three-set loss in the final of a Grand Slam.[236] She had previously been 6–0 and 8–0 respectively.
The week of February 15 marked Williams's 157th consecutive week ranked No. 1, passing Navratilova's mark of 156 to have the second-longest run in WTA history behind Steffi Graf's 186. She competed in Indian Wells as the No. 1 seed. She reached her first final here since winning in 2001 and before boycotting the event, by defeating Simona Halep in the quarterfinals and Agnieszka Radwańska in the semifinals. She did not drop a set en route to the final. Williams was upset by No. 13 seed Victoria Azarenka, whom she had defeated the last five times the pair had met, in straight sets. This marked the first time since 2004 where Williams lost two consecutive finals. She next played the Miami Open as the defending champion. She lost in the fourth round to Svetlana Kuznetsova. This marked her first loss here since 2012 and ended her 20 match winning streak in Miami. This was also her earliest exit here since 2000, where she lost in the same round. During the clay court swing, Williams withdrew from Madrid but entered Rome. She beat Anna-Lena Friedsam and Christina McHale to progress to the quarterfinals where she defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova to avenge her loss in Miami. She then went on to beat Irina-Camelia Begu and Madison Keys to win her 70th career WTA title and to win her first title of the year. This was her third Rome title in four years and fourth overall.[citation needed]
At the French Open, Williams dropped only one set en route to the final. She defeated Yulia Putintseva in the quarterfinals despite being five points away from losing. She then beat surprise semifinalist Kiki Bertens to reach her fourth French Open final where she faced Garbiñe Muguruza in a repeat of last year's Wimbledon final where Williams was victorious. The result was not the same as that Wimbledon final as Williams lost to Muguruza in straight sets. With this loss, Williams had lost two consecutive Grand Slam finals for the first time in her career. On top of failing to equal Steffi Graf's Open Era record of 22 Grand Slam singles titles, Williams also completed the Career Grand Slam runner-up set with this loss.[citation needed]
At Wimbledon, Williams only lost one set en route to the final where she faced Angelique Kerber in a rematch of their Australian Open final earlier in the year. This time, Williams defeated Kerber in straight sets to finally equal Steffi Graf's record of 22 Grand Slams in the Open Era. That was Williams's first Grand Slam title of the year, as well as her 71st career WTA title overall. In what was a brilliant serving performance, Williams only faced one break point in the whole match against Kerber which she saved with an ace. Later that day, Williams partnered with sister Venus to win their sixth Wimbledon doubles title and 14th doubles Grand Slam title overall, keeping their perfect record at Grand Slam doubles finals intact. On July 24, 2016, Williams withdrew from Rogers Cup citing a shoulder inflammation injury.[237] She next participated in the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where she was the defending gold medalist in both singles and doubles and was the heavy favourite to retain those titles. Partnering with her sister Venus in the doubles, they suffered a shock exit in the first round, losing to the Czech duo of Lucie Šafářová and Barbora Strýcová, which ended their career record of 15–0 dating back to the 2000 Olympics.[238] In singles, after defeating Daria Gavrilova and Alizé Cornet in the first two rounds, Williams faced Ukraine's Elina Svitolina in the third round in what was a rematch of this year's French Open fourth round, but lost to the Ukrainian, bringing an end to her Olympics campaign.[239] Days after the Olympics, Williams took a late wildcard for the Western & Southern Open, where she was the defending champion, but then decided to withdraw owing to concerns from the same shoulder injury/inflammation from earlier in the summer.[240]
The week of September 5, 2016, marked Williams's 186th consecutive week ranked No. 1, equalling Steffi Graf's record for longest run in WTA history. In the semifinals of the US Open, Williams lost to Karolína Plíšková.[241] Having won the US Open, Angelique Kerber became the No. 1, ending Williams's No. 1 streak. Williams also pulled out of the WTA Finals because of a shoulder injury.[242]

2017: Australian Open victory and pregnancy
Main article: 2017 Serena Williams tennis season
Williams started her 2017 season by participating in the WTA Auckland Open for the first time in her career. She defeated Pauline Parmentier to win her first match since the US Open. In the second round, she lost to Madison Brengle. At the Australian Open, she beat former and present top 10 players Belinda Bencic, Lucie Šafářová, Johanna Konta among others to reach her 8th Australian Open final. On January 28, 2017, she won the Australian Open for an Open Era record seventh time, defeating her sister, Venus.[243] It was her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, surpassing Steffi Graf's Open Era record of 22. It was the first time in the Open Era that two players aged 35 or older had competed in the final of a Grand Slam tournament. The win ensured her return to the No. 1 ranking.[244][245] Williams subsequently withdrew from the Indian Wells and Miami Opens, citing a knee injury.[246]
On April 19, 2017, Williams revealed that she was 20 weeks pregnant and would miss the remainder of the season.[247] The timing of her announcement led to the conclusion that she would have been roughly eight to nine weeks pregnant when she won the Australian Open.[248] In interviews, she said that she intended to return to tennis after her pregnancy,[249] saying that she had an "outrageous plan" of competing in the 2018 Australian Open.[249]
On September 1, 2017, Williams gave birth to a daughter.[250] She had a cesarean-section delivery due to a pulmonary embolism during labor.[251] She suffered another pulmonary embolism after giving birth, leaving her bedridden for six weeks and delaying her return to training.[252]
On December 30, 2017, Williams played her first match since giving birth, an exhibition match at the World Tennis Championship in Abu Dhabi, losing to reigning French Open champion Jeļena Ostapenko.

 Williams at the 2018 French Open, her first grand slam since returning to the tour
2018: Return to tennis, Wimbledon and US Open runner up
On January 5, 2018, Williams withdrew from the upcoming Australian Open, citing a lack of sufficient preparation in the wake of her pregnancy.[253] In February, after overcoming her pregnancy-induced health problems, she returned to the tennis court with her sister. The pair lost to Lesley Kerkhove and Demi Schuurs (Netherlands) in the Fed Cup's first round on February 11.[254] Despite saying she was 100% ready to come back to tennis, Williams suffered back to back early exits at Indian Wells and Miami, losing in the third round at Indian Wells to her sister Venus and the first round at Miami to 2018 Indian Wells champion Naomi Osaka.[citation needed]
Williams made her return to Grand Slam tennis at the 2018 French Open, playing singles and doubles with her sister Venus. In the first round, she defeated Kristýna Plíšková in two tight sets and later 17th seed Ashleigh Barty in the second round. Then, she defeated 11th seed Julia Görges to set up a fourth-round match against 28th seed Maria Sharapova, whom she had beaten 18 consecutive times since 2004. Williams withdrew owing to an injury to her pectoral muscle sustained in a third-round match in doubles where she and Venus were defeated by Andreja Klepač and María José Martínez Sánchez.[255][256]
In July, Williams entered the Wimbledon Championships and was controversially seeded #25. With a world ranking at the time of 181,[257] many felt that the decision showed bias and favored Williams unduly.[258] Others argued that the All England Club, who do not base their seedings on players' current world rankings – as other grand slam tournaments do – had sensibly considered Williams's excellent historic record there. Williams herself said: "I was pleasantly surprised. I came in here expecting that maybe I wouldn't get a seed."[258] Her seeding resulted in Dominika Cibulková losing her place to be seeded.[citation needed]
By the second week of the tournament, for the first time in grand slam history, none of the top ten seeded women players had made it to the quarterfinals.[259] En route to the quarterfinals, Williams had beaten Arantxa Rus of Holland in round one, Viktoriya Tomova of Bulgaria in round 2, Kristina Mladenovic of France in round 3 and Evgeniya Rodina of Russia in round 4.[260] She had not lost a set in any of her matches till then. Williams then beat Italian Camila Giorgi in the quarterfinals after losing one set, and became the lowest ranked player to ever reach the Wimbledon semifinals.[261] She met 13th seed Julia Görges of Germany in the semifinal and beat her comfortably in two sets to reach her tenth Wimbledon final, the first since giving birth. She lost in the final in straight sets to Angelique Kerber of Germany in a rematch of the 2016 Wimbledon final.
Following her Wimbledon finals run, Williams entered the 2018 Silicon Valley Classic, her first appearance in a US Open series tournament since 2015. She recorded her most lopsided loss in her career to Johanna Konta in the first round, winning just a single game.[262] Williams later revealed in an interview with Time that she checked Instagram ten minutes prior to the match starting, and found out that the man who had fatally shot her half-sister, Yetunde, in 2003 was released on parole earlier in the year. She said in the interview, "I couldn't shake it out of my mind."[263]
Williams's next tournament was the Cincinnati Masters. She beat Daria Gavrilova of Australia in straight sets in the first round, but lost to Petra Kvitová in the second round in a three-set match that lasted over two hours.[citation needed] Her next tournament was the 2018 US Open in Flushing Meadows, New York, where she was seeded 17th, although ranked 26th in the WTA ranking at the time seeds were determined. She defeated Magda Linette in the first round, Carina Witthöft in the second round, her sister and 16th seed Venus in the third round, Kaia Kanepi in the fourth round, and 8th seed Karolína Plíšková in the quarterfinals. The match against Plíšková was a rematch of the 2016 US Open semifinal, which Plíšková had won. This was Williams's first win against a player in the top 10 (at the time of the match) since her return from pregnancy. Williams won her semifinal match against 19th seed Anastasija Sevastova of Latvia, winning a spot in the women's singles final against Naomi Osaka of Japan which she lost in straight sets. Williams was warned for illegal coaching, penalized a point for breaking her racket, and then penalized a game for verbal abuse of the chair umpire.

2019: Return to the top 10, injuries, Wimbledon and US Open runner-up
Williams started her 2019 season at the Australian Open, having not made an appearance at the tournament since winning the 2017 edition. Seeded 16th, she defeated Tatjana Maria, Eugenie Bouchard, and Dayana Yastremska in the first three rounds, before defeating top seed and world number one Simona Halep in the fourth. In the quarterfinals, she met 7th seed Karolína Plíšková. Plíšková won the first set and lead in the second, but Williams took control of the match, winning the second and rapidly taking a huge lead in the third. However, after Williams twisted her ankle while up match point, Plíšková won six consecutive games, saving four match points throughout the set to win the match. This was Williams's earliest defeat at the Australian Open since her fourth-round loss in 2014, and broke a streak of fourteen consecutive match wins in Grand Slam quarterfinals (having last lost a Grand Slam quarterfinal at the 2013 Australian Open). Despite this loss, her ranking climbed up to number 11.[citation needed]
Williams went on to defeat Victoria Azarenka in the second round of the Indian Wells Masters in her 2019 campaign for a third Indian Wells crown. In the third round, viral illness caused her to retire against Spain's Garbiñe Muguruza. This was the second consecutive year she had exited at this stage. She then sustained a recurrence of a long-term knee injury which caused her to pull out of Miami and Rome after playing one match. She could not train properly until after the French Open, where she lost in the third round.[264] At Wimbledon, Williams reached a major final for the 13th consecutive year. She also became the oldest grand slam finalist in the open era.[265] She lost the final to Simona Halep in two straight sets in under an hour.[266]
At the Canadian Open, Williams defeated Naomi Osaka in straight sets in the quarterfinals and Czech qualifier Marie Bouzkova in three sets in the semi finals. Against Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu, she retired in the first set after 19 minutes. She told the chair umpire of her decision to retire because of back spasms.[267] Her back problems continued at the Cincinnati Open, where she withdrew shortly before her first-round match, stating, "Unfortunately my back is still not right."[268]
Williams was seeded eighth at the US Open. In the first round she met Maria Sharapova for the first time since the 2016 Australian Open, defeating her in straight sets, yielding just one game in each set. She defeated Caty McNally in three sets in the second round, and Karolína Muchová and Petra Martić in straight games in the third and fourth. In the quarterfinals she faced 18th seed Wang Qiang, who she overcame in just 45 minutes, yielding a single game. In the semifinals she defeated fifth seed Elina Svitolina, proceeding to the final where she faced 15th seed Bianca Andreescu for the second time in under a month. With Andreescu up a set and five games to one in the second set, Williams launched a spirited comeback to level the set at 5-games-all. However, Andreescu was able to hold serve and break Williams to win the title in straight sets.[269] This was Williams's last match of the year which she ended ranked No. 10.

2020: First title since maternity leave
Top-seeded Williams won her first singles title as a mother at the 2020 ASB Classic, defeating Jessica Pegula in the final.[270] She also reached the finals in the doubles tournament with Caroline Wozniacki; the pair were defeated by Asia Muhammad and Taylor Townsend.[271] Hence, she became the first woman in the professional era with at least one title in four decades: the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s.[272]
Williams's next tournament was the 2020 Australian Open where she was seeded 8th. She defeated Anastasia Potapova and Tamara Zidanšek in the first and second rounds respectively in straight sets, before falling to Wang Qiang in three tight sets in the third round.
On the resumption of the WTA Tour following a pause caused by COVID-19, Williams entered the Top Seed Open as the top seed. Following a tough three-set win over Bernarda Pera in the first round, Williams faced her sister Venus for their 31st WTA match in the second round and came through after dropping the first set. Williams went on to suffer a shock defeat in the quarter finals to fellow American Shelby Rogers. At the Cincinnati Open, played in New York, Williams received a bye in the first round, beat Arantxa Rus in the second, and lost to Maria Sakkari in three sets in the third round.
Williams was seeded 3rd at the second major of the year, the 2020 US Open. After two straight sets victories to begin with, Williams faced former grand slam champion Sloane Stephens in the third round, winning in three sets. In the fourth round, Williams avenged her loss to Sakkari in the previous tournament. In the quarter-finals, she defeated Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria who was playing in her first tournament in three years after giving birth. She thus advanced into the semifinals, where she faced Victoria Azarenka, losing in three sets.[273][274] Her match with Azarenka marked the first time two mothers met in a Grand Slam semi-final.[275] She also became the first player in history to reach the semifinals of Grand slam and US Open in four decades: the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and 2020s.
Williams was seeded 6th at the delayed 2020 French Open held in cold and heavy conditions in October. After defeating Kristie Ahn in straight sets in the first round, Williams withdrew before her second round match against wildcard Tsvetana Pironkova, citing an achilles injury she had sustained during her semi-final defeat to Azarenka at the US Open. This meant for the first time since 2006, Serena failed to reach a Grand Slam final.

2021: Australian Open semifinal, out of top 40
Williams started the year by playing the Yarra Valley Classic, where she withdrew prior to her semifinal match against the top seed, Ashleigh Barty citing a right shoulder injury.[276]
In the Australian Open Williams was seeded 10th and lost to the 4th seed, Naomi Osaka, in the semifinal after defeating 2nd seed, Simona Halep, and 7th seed, Aryna Sabalenka, along the way. Williams's match with Osaka was the first time the two had met in a major since the infamous 2018 US Open final. When leaving the court after losing to Osaka in the Australian Open, Williams paused to acknowledge the crowd longer than she usually would. In the press conference following the match, she faced questions about whether she was bidding farewell to tennis and retiring. She said "I don't know, if I ever say farewell, I wouldn't tell anyone."[277]
In May, at the Italian Open, Serena Williams played her 1000th match of her career.[278] She was defeated by Nadia Podoroska in the second round in straight sets.[279]
On June 29, Williams would suffer an injury during the first set in the first round at Wimbledon against Belarusian player Aliaksandra Sasnovich, forcing her to withdraw from the competition.[280][281]
In August 2021, a leg injury forced Williams to withdraw from 2021 US Open.[282] Her withdrawal saw Williams plummet nineteen places to 41st in the world, her lowest year-end ranking in 15 years.

2022: King Richard promotion, Wimbledon and US Open, retirement
 The Williams sisters in 2022 during their final doubles match together
In December 2021, Williams announced she would not play the 2022 Australian Open, citing the same leg injury.[283] As of March 2022, she was ranked 241st.
She spent much of early 2022 promoting King Richard about her father with her sisters. She appeared at several award ceremonies including the 94th Academy Awards.[284]
Williams returned to professional play in June 2022 when she partnered up with Ons Jabeur in the Eastbourne International.[285] The pairing beat Sara Sorribes Tormo and Marie Bouzková in the first round, and Shuko Aoyama and Chan Hao-ching in the second.[286][287] The pairing retired from the tournament afterwards owing to an injury sustained by Jabeur.[288] Williams also entered the 2022 Wimbledon Championships in singles, having accepted a wildcard after dropping to 1204th in the singles rankings.[289] She lost to Harmony Tan in the first round in an over 3 hour match, the longest thus far at the tournament.[290][291]
In August, Williams wrote an article for Vogue, in which she announced her plans to 'evolve away' from tennis after the US Open, indicating retirement.[292][293] Williams began her farwell tour by entering the 2022 Canadian Open using a protected ranking. She beat Nuria Párrizas Díaz in straight sets for her first singles win in 14 months, before losing to Belinda Bencic.[294][295] Williams subsequently entered the 2022 Cincinnati Masters, in which she lost to reigning US Open champion Emma Raducanu in the first round.[296]
Before the US Open, Williams announced she would play doubles with Venus for the first time since 2018. Their opening-round match marked the first time a first-round doubles match was held in the Arthur Ashe Stadium during television primetime. The sisters lost to the Czech duo of Lucie Hradecká and Linda Nosková.[297]
In singles, Williams won her opening-round match against Danka Kovinić. In the second round, she upset world No. 2 Anett Kontaveit to become the oldest woman ever to defeat a top-three ranked player.[citation needed] She then played what was expected to be her final match against Ajla Tomljanović, losing in three hard-fought sets.

Transition from tennis
In the September 2022 issue of Vogue, written in August, Williams announced that she was "evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me". In her announcement she said that she disliked the word "retirement" and preferred the term "evolution".[298]
She went on to cite growing her family, focusing on her venture capital firm, and spending more time with family as reasons she would be leaving the sport. While she did not set an exact time for her goodbye, she stated that she was not ready to win Wimbledon (where she lost in the first round), but would try to win in New York. She also said that she consulted Tiger Woods in her decision.[298]
At her first match since the publication of the Vogue article, where she lost to Belinda Bencic in Toronto, tournament organizers interviewed Williams on-court after her match and gave her gifts to remember the city.[299]
At her matches at the 2022 US Open, which many believed would be her last tournament, tournament directors played a video following her opponents' introduction but before Williams' walk-out. Some saw this as disrespectful to her opponents.[300]
Following her first-round match, where Woods, Mike Tyson, Bill Clinton, Ruth Westheimer, Spike Lee, Vera Wang, and Eric Adams were in attendance, the tournament played a video narrated by Oprah Winfrey and had Gayle King facilitate the post-match on-court interview.[301][302][303]
Following her announcement, many fellow players, including Naomi Osaka and Coco Gauff, praised Williams and said they would not be playing tennis if not for her.[304]

Playing style
Williams is an aggressive baseliner, whose game is centered around her powerful serve and forceful groundstrokes. Owing to her high-risk playing style, she typically hits a large number of both winners and unforced errors. Williams' greatest asset is her serve, which is considered the greatest in the history of women's tennis. Her serve is known for its fast pace and accurate placement, allowing her to serve numerous aces: at the 2013 Australian Open, she served a 128.6 mph (207 km/h) ace in her third round match against Ayumi Morita, which is the third fastest serve recorded in WTA history.[305] Williams possesses an accurate and consistent ball toss, allowing her to serve to any position on the court with minimal differences in the position of the ball in the air; this makes it difficult for opponents to read her service motion and predict the position of her serve, allowing her to dominate a rally from the first stroke.[306] Williams also possesses effective and accurate kick and slice serves, which she deploys as second serves, minimizing double faults, and preventing opponents from scoring free points.[307]
Williams is also known for her forceful groundstrokes, which are considered two of the most powerful shots in the history of women's tennis.[308] She hits both her forehand and her backhand in an open stance, allowing her to generate consistently powerful, heavy, and dominating groundstrokes, and to generate sharp, acute angles, which allow her to hit winners from any position on the court.[309] Williams is known for her forehand, which has been described as "devastating".[310] Her forehand is hit with heavy topspin; this allows her to dominate rallies, and she is capable of hitting her forehand both crosscourt and down the line to produce winners.[311] Her two-handed backhand is equally dominant, and has been described as one of the greatest backhands of all time.[312] Williams tends to hit her backhand flatter than her forehand, allowing her to hit her backhand with speed, power, and depth both crosscourt and down the line. Despite playing primarily from the baseline, Williams is an adept net player thanks to her extensive doubles experience, and will frequently choose to finish points at the net, either with deft touch, aggressive drive volleys, or a solid, powerful, and reliable overhead smash.[313] Williams possesses an aggressive return of serve – she neutralizes powerful first serves, and attacks weak second serves. She is widely considered one of the greatest return players of all time.[314]
Despite predominantly employing an aggressive game style, she is also an excellent defender, and is capable of counterpunching against aggressive opponents until she creates an opportunity to hit a winner. She is an exceptional athlete, known for her movement, speed, court coverage, agility, flexibility, balance, and footwork. Her on-court intelligence, shot selection, and point construction allow her to execute her gamestyle effectively.[315] She has been praised for her mental strength and competitive spirit, with her being described as one of the toughest opponents to beat on the court; Martina Navratilova declared her mental strength "unbelievable",[316] whilst tennis journalist Jon Wertheim claimed that Williams is the toughest player of all time.[317] American tennis player Christina McHale praised her composure in high pressure moments, stating that, for Williams, "being clutch is like breathing", and that she "seems to come through every single time in the most pressure-packed situations".[318] She has been noted for her ability to produce extraordinary comebacks, particularly on the Grand Slam level, winning three Slams after saving match points, a feat achieved more often than by any other player in tennis history.[319] Williams bounced back from a set down to win 37 Grand Slam matches; her ability to come back from set and break deficits in Grand Slam matches was described by John McEnroe as "a gift", and McEnroe declared that she was "the greatest" competitor in the history of women's tennis.[320] She has also been praised for her ability to serve aces at critical moments. As noted by retired player Li Na in 2016, "break point down, [there is an] 80% chance [she] serves an ace".[321]
Owing to her exceptional serve, powerful groundstrokes, technical mastery, aggressive return of serve, athleticism, and mental strength, Williams has been described as one of the most complete players on tour, and one of the greatest players of all time, irrespective of gender.[322] Williams has stated that her favourite surface is clay, as the slow pace and high bounce afforded aids point construction, although she also excels on faster hard and grass courts.[323]

Rivalries
Serena vs. Venus
Main article: Williams sisters rivalry
Williams played older sister Venus in 31 professional matches since 1998.[54] Overall, Serena is 19–12 against her sister.[54] Serena played Venus 15 times in Grand Slam singles and 13 times in other tournaments (including 11 finals).[324] They have met in nine Grand Slam tournament finals, with Serena winning seven times.[54] Beginning with the 2002 French Open, they played each other in four consecutive Grand Slam finals, which was the first time in the Open Era that the same two players had contested four consecutive finals in Grand Slam singles.[325]

Williams vs. Hingis
Main article: Hingis–S. Williams rivalry
Williams leads the series 7–6.[326] One of Williams's first rivalries was with Martina Hingis, who turned pro less than one year before her (Hingis in October 1994, Williams in 1995). They first played each other at the 1998 Miami Open where Hingis won in three sets. All but one of their matches was played on a hard court with the exception being a contest on clay in Rome 1999, which Hingis won in straight sets. Their last match took place at the 2002 Miami Open with Williams winning in a loss of just four games.[327] Hingis was forced to briefly retire citing ankle injuries.[328]

Williams vs. Capriati
Williams leads the series against Jennifer Capriati 10–7.[329] Once considered one of the best rivalries in women's tennis,[330] the competition between Williams and Capriati was stiff with 12 out of 17 meetings going three sets. The rivalry, starting in 1999, began one sided with Capriati winning four of their first five matches. Williams would then go on to win the next eight.[329] Williams and Capriati played with similar styles, both known for using their power and athleticism to gain quick advantages in points.[331][332]

Williams vs. Henin
Main article: Henin–S. Williams rivalry
Williams leads the series 8–6. Justine Henin and Williams met 14 times, five of which were in tournament finals. In majors they have faced each other seven times with Henin leading 4–3.[333] Opposite personalities and styles of play are often cited as what made their rivalry entertaining.[334][335]
In the semifinals of the 2003 French Open, when at 4–2, 30–0 on Williams's serve in the third set, Henin raised her hand to indicate she was not ready to receive; Williams then put her serve into the net. The umpire did not see Henin raise her hand, and thus did not allow Williams a first serve. Williams lost the game and would go on to lose the match. Their last match took place in the final of the 2010 Australian Open where Williams won in three sets to take her 12th major title.[333]

Williams vs. Azarenka
Williams leads the series 18–5. The rivalry began at the 2008 Australian Open, and their most recent match was in the semifinals of the 2020 US Open. Williams holds a 10–1 record in Grand Slams. Azarenka is the only person to ever win four WTA tour level finals against Williams.[336] While their rivalry is heavily favored towards Williams, their matches are known for their fierce competitiveness, and Azarenka is considered the only player to truly challenge Williams following the retirement of Capriati, Henin, and Hingis, with 9 of their matches extending to three sets.[337]

Williams vs. Sharapova
Williams leads the series 20–2. The pair first met in the fourth round of the 2004 Miami Open, where Williams defeated Sharapova 6–4, 6–3. Their rivalry truly began at the 2004 Wimbledon final, where Williams was the two-time defending champion; Sharapova upset her 6–1, 6–4. Williams next lost to Sharapova in the finals of the 2004 WTA Tour Championships, 6–4, 2–6, 4–6. Since then, however, Williams dominated the rivalry, winning all of their clashes, with only three of their matches going to three sets. They met 10 times in Grand Slam tournaments, where Williams led 9–1, and they further met in 9 finals, with Williams leading 7–2. Sharapova retired in February 2020, with their final match being in the first round of the 2019 US Open; Williams defeated Sharapova 6–1, 6–1 in one hour exactly. Despite the one-sided nature of their rivalry, it is considered one of the most prominent rivalries on the WTA Tour of the 21st century, due to alleged personality clashes, similarly aggressive playing styles, and significant media interest.[338]

Match controversies
Accusations of match fixing
When both of the Williams sisters entered the top ten and started meeting in tournaments, rumors of match fixing started to circulate. John McEnroe, while commenting on the 2000 Wimbledon semifinal between the two sisters, said that "Serena may not be allowed to win. Richard [Williams] may have something to say about this."[339] After losing to Venus at the Indian Wells quarterfinals in 2001, Elena Dementieva asserted during a post-match interview that Richard Williams decided the results of matches between the two sisters.[340] Shortly after that, Venus Williams pulled out of her Indian Wells semifinal match against Serena Williams at the last minute, claiming tendinitis; this occurrence garnered much speculation in the press, and some fans demanded their money back.[341][342][343]

Indian Wells boycott
At the 2001 Ericsson Open the following week, Richard Williams stated that racist comments were made to him in the stands,[344] and the tournament director refused to offer Williams an apology for how he was treated.[citation needed] As a result, neither sister played the tournament even though it had become a mandatory stop on the WTA tour since 2009. In 2015, Williams decided to end her 14-year boycott and played.[345]

2004 US Open
In her US Open quarterfinal match against Jennifer Capriati, an incorrect overrule was made by chair umpire Mariana Alves; the video review showed that Williams's shot landed in bounds. In the same match, new technology being tested made incorrect line calls late in the third set. Williams argued with the chair over a couple of calls during the match, but was not successful. Capriati won the match, with Serena herself acknowledging that this was primarily due to her 57 unforced errors; nevertheless, she accused Alves of temporary insanity[346] and said that she "felt cheated".[347] In a post-match interview Capriati sharply observed that bad calls had gone against her in the past as well. Alves did not officiate for the remainder of the tournament; this was not punitive, as commonly thought, as she was not scheduled to officiate.[348] The controversy renewed calls for, and was widely given credit for, the adoption of technology such as the MacCAM and Hawk-Eye systems.[349]

2009 US Open
In the US Open semifinal round against Kim Clijsters, Williams slammed her racket on the court after losing the first set. She was given a warning, with a potential second violation carrying a one-point penalty. While trailing 4–6, 5–6, 15–30, Williams's second serve was called a foot fault, resulting in two match points for Clijsters. Williams gestured with her racket to the lineswoman who had made the call and yelled at her, with profanities and a threat to shove a tennis ball down the lineswoman's throat.[350] During the subsequent on-court conference between the chair umpire, the lineswoman, US Open officials, and Williams, a television microphone picked up Williams saying to the lineswoman, "I didn't say I would kill you! Are you serious?"[351] The incident resulted in Williams being penalized a point for unsportsmanlike conduct‍—‌necessitated by the earlier warning for racket abuse‍—‌meaning Clijsters won the match 6–4, 7–5. The following day, Williams was issued the maximum permissible on-site fine of $10,000 (plus $500 for racket abuse). After further investigation, the Grand Slam Committee in November 2009 fined her $175,000 in place of suspending her from the 2010 US Open or other Grand Slam events.[352] They also placed her on a two-year probation which provided that if Williams committed another offense at a Grand Slam event in the next two years, she would be suspended from participating in the following US Open. If, however, she committed no offenses within the next two years, her fine would be reduced to $82,500.[352] Williams initially refused to apologize for her outburst, both in her post-match press conference[353] and in an official statement released the following day.[124] She eventually did apologize, stating "I just really wanted to apologize sincerely because I'm a very prideful person, and I'm a very intense person and a very emotional person", and "I wanted to offer my sincere apologies to anyone that I may have offended." She said she was humbled by the experience.[354]

2011 US Open
In the final of the 2011 US Open against Samantha Stosur, Williams shouted "Come on!" as the Australian attempted to return a forehand Williams believed to be a winner. The chair umpire Eva Asderaki awarded the point to Stosur based on the ITF's deliberate hindrance rule, which states, "If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if involuntary, the point shall be replayed."[355] As the point was 30–40 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur. Williams became angry with the chair umpire and made several gestures and unflattering comments toward her during the next changeover, including telling Asderaki that if the umpire ever saw Serena coming toward her, she should "look the other way".[356] Williams initially gained momentum in the set following the penalty, breaking back in the next game, but eventually flagged and lost the match, 2–6, 3–6. At the end of the match, she declined to offer the customary handshake to Asderaki.[357][358] Williams mentioned the incident in her post-match speech as the tournament runner-up, asserting, "I hit a winner, but I guess it didn't count", but added, "It wouldn't have mattered in the end. Sam played well."[359] A writer for ESPN suggested that Williams could avoid being found to have violated the terms of the "probation" on which she was placed following her 2009 outburst, as she did not appear to have used profanity in addressing Asderaki during the match.[360] In the end, Williams was fined $2,000 and was not barred from competing in the 2012 US Open because "Williams' conduct, while verbally abusive, does not rise to the level of a major offense under the Grand Slam Code of Conduct."[361]

2018 US Open
Williams's 2018 US Open ended in controversy with Williams falling to Naomi Osaka in straight sets following a game penalty in the second set of the final. During that second set, she was given a code violation because her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, gave her coaching hand signals. Williams was upset by the violation, claiming that her coach was simply giving her a thumbs up, and demanded an apology from chair umpire Carlos Ramos. Mouratoglou later admitted that he was coaching.[362] She received a second violation for smashing her racket on the court, which resulted in a point penalty. After her third code violation for verbal abuse against the umpire, Williams was assessed a game penalty.[363][364] Williams said that she believed she was treated unfairly by the umpire because she is a woman.[365] Williams was fined a total of $17,000 including $4,000 for a coaching violation, $3,000 for racket abuse and $10,000 for verbal abuse towards the umpire.[366]

Other issues
In the beginning years of Williams' professional career, hair beads donned by the Williams sisters were the focus of discussion by commentators such as Chris Evert and John McEnroe, with Mary Carillo characterizing their hair as "noisy and disruptive".[367] The beads often broke and scattered across the court. Scholar Nancy E. Spencer said that commentary that dismissed the Williams' cultural hairstyles served to "other" the sisters, particularly in the context of a white dominated sport where their appearance and specifically their physicality is a popular topic for discussion.[367]
Following the match controversy at the 2018 US Open final between Williams and Naomi Osaka, the Melbourne newspaper the Herald Sun published a cartoon by Mark Knight depicting Williams having a tantrum and breaking her racket while the umpire asks her opponent to "just let her win".[368] The cartoon was widely criticized as racist and sexist, including by Williams's husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, and author J. K. Rowling.[369][370] Complaints centered around the portrayal of Williams as an angry black woman with exaggerated large lips, a broad flat nose, and positioned in an ape-like pose, and the portrayal of Williams's opponent, Osaka, who is half-Japanese, half-Haitian, with blonde hair.[371] The editor of the Herald Sun argued the cartoon was unfairly criticized on social media.[372] Knight defended his work, saying that his satire was never about race or gender, but was about putting a spotlight on bad behavior by sporting superstars. In the immediate aftermath of the controversy he suspended his Twitter account to "protect his family and friends".[372]
In September 2019, Romanian television host Radu Banciu made the following comments during a live broadcast: "Serena Williams looks exactly like one of those monkeys at the zoo with the red asses."[373] Romania's National Council for Combating Discrimination fined Banciu approximately $1,875 for his comments.

Legacy
Williams is considered one of the best female tennis players of all time. In 2017, BBC Sport users picked Williams as the greatest female tennis player of the Open Era. BBC presenter and former French Open Champion, Sue Barker, said "Serena is the greatest because this era is so much more competitive than previous eras. The pace she generates – her serve is without question the greatest ever – combined with her movement and her power, she pushes her opponents constantly on the back foot".[374] In 2018, a Tennis.com panel selected Serena as the greatest female tennis player in the Open Era.[375] Some commentators, players and sports writers regard Williams as the greatest woman tennis player of all time.[b] In 2018, Federer said the player who probably had the best case for tennis "Greatest Of All Time", man or woman, was Serena Williams.[377] In 2020, the Tennis Channel ranked Williams as the greatest woman tennis player of all time.[378] In 2022, John McEnroe described Williams as an "icon" and the "GOAT of GOATs".[379][380]

Alongside her sister Venus, Williams has been widely credited with increasing diversity within the sport:[381][382][383]It all starts with Venus and Serena. The demonstration effect. The power of seeing two African-American girls with braids in the finals of the biggest tournaments in the world in a predominantly white sport. Just a huge impact that really can't be overstated. That attracted thousands of girls into the sport, not just African-American but all backgrounds and races.
— Martin Blackman, General Manager of Player Development, United States Tennis Association[384]Former U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens, French Open finalist Coco Gauff and four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka, have thanked Williams, saying that they never would've picked up a racket, if it was not for her.[385]
For their first match of March 2019, the women of the United States women's national soccer team each wore a jersey with the name of a woman they were honoring on the back; Crystal Dunn chose the name of Serena Williams.[386]
In December 2019, The Associated Press named Williams Female Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s.[387]
In September 2022, Twitter said that Williams was the most tweeted about female athlete ever.[388]

Personal life
 Williams's husband Alexis Ohanian in 2018
Williams is married to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. He proposed to her on December 10, 2016, in Rome.[389] On December 30, 2016, Williams announced their engagement in a Reddit post.[390] They married on November 16, 2017, in New Orleans. Guests at the wedding included Beyoncé, Anna Wintour, Kelly Rowland and Kim Kardashian.[391] She planned to move to San Francisco with Ohanian after the wedding.[249]
On April 19, 2017, Williams posted a sideways picture of herself on Snapchat that focused on her midsection; it had the caption, "20 weeks", prompting speculation that she was pregnant.[392] Later that evening, her spokesperson confirmed the pregnancy.[393] The fact that she was 20 weeks pregnant when announcing her pregnancy meant that she was eight weeks pregnant when she won the Australian Open earlier that year.[394] Williams later said that posting the picture on Snapchat was an accident, and that she had intended to save the photo for her records.[395]
In September 2017, Williams gave birth to her daughter.[396][397] She had an emergency caesarean-section delivery due to the baby's heart rate dropping during labor and was at first devastated about it.[251] She suffered a pulmonary embolism after giving birth, leaving her bedridden for six weeks and delaying her return to training.[252] (This encounter was not her first with the disease venous thromboembolism; she had been hospitalized in 2011 for pulmonary embolism thought to have originated from a deep vein thrombosis.)[398] In August 2018, she revealed she was suffering from postpartum depression.[399] Williams gave her daughter a doll, Qai Qai, that has become famous on social media.[400] She has also faced many questions whether she would raise her daughter to play tennis to which she answered saying she has already hired a coach for her daughter. She also posts many pictures of her and her daughter on the tennis court with rackets.[401]
Williams was raised one of Jehovah's Witness, but states she has "never really practiced it".[249] She often thanks Jehovah after winning matches.[402] Williams confirmed that she follows some practices: "(she) doesn't celebrate birthdays. We're Jehovah's Witnesses, so we don't do that."[403] In January 2023, about half a year after her retirement, she was baptized as a Jehovah's Witness in Florida.[404]
Williams' current agent is former player Jill Smoller.[405]

Off-court activities
Equipment and endorsements
In the early 2000s, Williams wore Puma apparel and footwear on court.[406] Williams signed a five-year endorsement deal with Nike in 2004 for $40 million, and has been endorsed by the company for clothing, apparel, and footwear ever since.[407] Nike designs custom clothing for Williams, which she wears on the court along with custom footwear. The largest building on Nike's Portland campus is the one million square foot Serena Williams Building which features many references to the athlete's career and her long collaboration with Nike.[408][409] According to John Hoke, Nike's Chief Design Officer, Williams made an important contribution to the creative process of the design of the building.[410]
She used the Wilson Hammer Stretch range of racquets when she won her first Grand Slam title in 1999, before switching to the Hyper Hammer range.[411] She switched to the Wilson nCode briefly in 2005, and used various iterations of the Wilson Blade racquet since 2008. Her racquet is typically oversized, with a head size of 104 square inches. Since 2017, Wilson has manufactured a signature racquet, the Wilson Blade SW104, which is designed to Williams's specifications. Since 2020, Williams used a smaller variant of this racquet, the Wilson Blade SW102 Autograph.[412]
Williams also has endorsement deals with AbbVie, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Aston Martin, AT&T, Audemars Piguet, Beats by Dre, Berlei Bras, Block Inc, Bumble, Chase Bank, Delta Air Lines, DirecTV, DoorDash, Ford Motor, Gatorade, Gucci, Hanes, IBM, Intel, Mission Athletecare, OnePiece, OPI Products, Pepsi, Subway,Tempur, Tonal and the Walt Disney Company.[33][413][414][415]
In 2015, Williams became the CSO (Chief Sporting Officer) for British luxury automobile manufacturer Aston Martin. She then posted her first experience on social media service Twitter, and said: "I'm loving my first day on the job as Chief Sporting Officer and Director of Fun!", stating her optimism on the job as the CSO.[416][417]
Williams is also on the board of directors at SurveyMonkey.[418]

Fashion
Williams has been noted for her unusual and colorful outfits on court. In 2002, there was much talk when she wore a black lycra catsuit at the US Open.[419] At the 2004 US Open, Williams wore denim skirts and knee-high boots—tournament officials did not allow her to wear the boots during matches.[420] At the 2008 Wimbledon, the white trench coat she wore during warm-up for her opening match was the subject of much discussion since it was worn despite sunny weather.[421] Some social scientists have argued that the most negative reactions to Williams's on-court fashion statements, especially in newspaper coverage of the Australian Open and Wimbledon, combines with writers' fixation upon her muscular body to distract from her on-court accomplishments and fit this commentary within centuries-old narratives of the "pornographic eroticism" and "sexual grotesquerie" of African and African-American women.[422]
Williams formerly had a special line with Puma.[423] In April 2004, she signed a deal worth US$40 million for a line with Nike.[424] Since 2004, she has also run her own line of designer apparel, "Aneres"—her first name spelled backward. In 2009, she launched a signature collection of handbags and jewelry.[425] The collection, Signature Statement, is sold mainly on the Home Shopping Network (HSN).[426]
In early 2010, Williams became a certified nail technician in preparation for her upcoming nail collection with a company called HairTech.[427] In 2015, she became the first black female athlete to have a picture by herself on the cover of Vogue, which she did for the April 2015 issue.[428] In 2015, she also presented her HSN Signature Statement collection for the second time at the New York Fashion Week Show‍—‌a clothing line exclusively made for the retailer HSN.[426]
In May 2018, she wore a skin-tight catsuit at the 2018 French Open that likened a superhero outfit and helped promote her new clothing line, Serena.[429][430][431] The outfit was subsequently banned by the French Tennis Federation president Bernard Giudicelli, with the explanation: "It will no longer be accepted. One must respect the game and the place." Williams then wore a black tutu to her first match at the 2018 US Open on August 27, 2018, against Magda Linette which she dominated in straight sets.[432][433] In February 2019, Serena Williams was appointed to the board of directors of online fashion marketplace Poshmark.[434]
In Fall 2019, Williams launched the first collection of her sustainable clothing line, S by Serena.[435] Inspired by 1990s street wear, S by Serena collections are shown on a range of body types and sizes (ranging from XS to 3X), highlighting the line's focus on inclusivity.[436]

Activism
Williams became more involved in social change as her career progressed, primarily using social media as a medium of expressing her views. In 2016 she posted her support of Black Lives Matter on her Facebook page, voicing her concern about her young nephew being in danger from police officers owing to his skin color.[437] During American tennis player Tennys Sandgren's breakthrough run to the quarterfinals of the 2018 Australian Open, it was revealed that he tweeted insensitive words about the LGBT community, followed members of the alt-right, and referred to an article describing Williams's on-court behavior as "disgusting". Williams responded by tweeting her displeasure, saying, "@TennysSandgren I don't need or want one. But there is an entire group of people that deserves an apology. I can't look at my daughter and tell her I sat back and was quiet. No! She will know how to stand up for herself and others – through my example." Additionally, she attached an image that read, "Maturity is being able to apologize and admit when you're wrong because you know that your mistakes don't define you".[438]
Also in 2016, Serena Williams wrote an open letter in Porter Magazine's "Incredible Women of 2016" to speak out about gender equality and her personal struggles as a woman in tennis.[439] She noted that women's contributions to the sport of tennis are not recognized in the way men's contributions are recognized; she also called out issues of equal pay in tennis. She ended the letter stating that she hoped that her letter would inspire a new generation of women to "push for greatness and follow their dreams with steadfast resilience."[440]
Williams received several awards for her activism, namely those directed towards Black communities. She was listed among the 35 "most remarkable and beautiful black women" in the world by Essence magazine.[441] The NAACP honored Williams with the President's Award at the annual NAACP Image Awards.[citation needed][442]
Williams, in 2014, founded the equity company "Serena Ventures".[443] The firm's goal is to help start-up companies whose perspectives and innovations level the playing field for women and people of color.

Entertainment
Williams has appeared on television and also provided voice work on animated shows: in a 2001 episode of The Simpsons Serena joined the animation along with sister Venus, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi.[444] She has also provided guest voice work in a 2005 episode of Playhouse Disney's animated kids show Higglytown Heroes and a 2007 episode of the Nickelodeon cartoon Avatar: The Last Airbender,[445] which she has described as her "favorite show".[446]
Williams posed for the 2003 and 2004 editions of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.[447] In April 2005, MTV announced plans to broadcast a reality show around the lives of Serena and Venus, which was eventually aired on ABC Family. Williams has appeared twice on MTV's Punk'd and in 2007, appeared in the ABC reality television series Fast Cars and Superstars: The Gillette Young Guns Celebrity Race. In 2002, she played Miss Wiggins in the season 3 episode "Crouching Mother, Hidden Father" of My Wife and Kids;[448] she has also guest-starred in episodes of The Bernie Mac Show, ER and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.[449] In 2007, Williams appeared in the music video of "I Want You" by the American rapper Common, alongside performers Alicia Keys and Kanye West.[450]
In late 2009, Williams became the first active female professional athlete to appear in a feminine hygiene product advertising campaign. A series of online videos and print advertisements for Tampax Pearl tampons showed her hitting balls at Mother Nature, played by Catherine Lloyd Burns, to prevent Mother Nature giving her a red-wrapped gift, representing her menstrual period. In the online videos, the two have dueling press conferences over the "bad blood" between them. "A lot of celebrities are not open to working with our brand, and we're thrilled that Serena is", said a brand manager for Tampax at Procter & Gamble.[451]
In July 2012, she appeared on ABC's comedic improv TV series Trust Us with Your Life and as a lawyer on Lifetime's television series Drop Dead Diva.[citation needed]
To celebrate the 35th anniversary of Pac-Man, Williams made a cameo appearance in the film Pixels, which starred Adam Sandler and Kevin James, and premiered on July 24, 2015.[452]
Williams is known to be close to Beyoncé and made a cameo appearance dancing in Beyoncé's music video for the song Sorry in the hit album Lemonade. Williams said the director told her, "We would love for you to be in this particular song. It's about strength and it's about courage and that's what we see you as."[453]
In 2021, Williams signed a first-look deal with Amazon Studios.[454] She makes a cameo appearance as herself in the 2022 Netflix film Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.[455]

Language fluency
In addition to English as her native language, Williams also speaks conversational French and knows some Spanish and Italian. At the 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2018 French Open she gave her on-court interviews in French much to the crowd's delight.[456][457]

Miami Dolphins venture
In August 2009, Williams and her sister Venus became minority owners of the Miami Dolphins after purchasing a small stake in the team. They live near each other in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida,[249] which is about an hour's drive from the Dolphins' stadium. They are the first black women to hold any amount of ownership in an NFL franchise.[458]

Charity work
In 2004 and 2005, Serena and her sister, Venus, visited hospitals and played several tennis matches in predominantly black cities to raise money for the local Ronald McDonald House charities. An ESPN episode was dedicated to the Williams sisters' charity tour.[441] In 2008, as part of the Serena Williams Foundation's work, Williams helped to fund the construction of the Serena Williams Secondary School in Matooni, Kenya.[459][460][461] The Serena Williams Foundation also provides university scholarships for underprivileged students in the United States. In 2016, the Serena Williams Fund partnered with Helping Hands Jamaica to build the Salt Marsh Primary School for Jamaican youth in Trelawny Parish.[462][463] She received a Celebrity Role Model Award from Avon Foundation in 2003 for work in breast cancer.[464] Williams has also been involved in a number of clinics at schools and community centers, particularly those which have programs focusing on at-risk youth.[1] She has also won the "Young Heroes Award" from Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater L.A. and Inland (2003) and the "Family Circle and Prudential Financial Player Who Makes a Difference Award" (2004).[1] In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Williams, along with other ATP and WTA stars, decided to forgo their final day of preparation for the 2010 Australian Open to form a charity event in which all proceeds would go to the Haiti earthquake victims.[465] Serena, along with her sister Venus, is a supporter and contributor of First Serve Miami, a foundation for youth who want to learn tennis but are socially and economically challenged.[466][467][468][469] She has been an International Goodwill Ambassador with UNICEF since 2011 and has helped launch UNICEF's Schools for Asia campaign.[470][471][472][473]
In addition to the Serena Williams Fund in 2016, Serena and Venus collaborated on the Williams Sisters Fund to work on philanthropic projects together.[474] Also in 2016, in their childhood home of Compton, California Serena and Venus teamed up to found the Yetunde Price Resource Center, in honor of their late sister. The Resource Center provides services to families affected by community violence.[474]
Williams's return to Indian Wells in 2015 was done in partnership with the Equal Justice Initiative, a non-profit organization that provides legal representation to those who might have been denied a fair trial.[475] EJI executive director Bryan Stevenson lauded her courage in supporting his organization. "It's so rare when athletes at the top of their game are willing to embrace a set of issues that, for a lot of people, are edgier", he said. "This is not aid to orphans. ... She was standing when a lot of her contemporaries remain seated, speaking up when others are being quiet."[476]
In 2014, Williams began hosting an annual charity run named "The Serena Williams Ultimate Fun Run". The event is in support of the Serena Williams Fund, which helps underprivileged individuals and communities that are affected by senseless violence and to ensure equal access to education of youth.[477][474][478]
In 2017, Williams became Ambassador for the Allstate Foundation's Purple Purse project, an initiative to provide financial empowerment to domestic abuse victims.[479][480] In a press release, Vicky Dinges, Allstate's senior vice president of corporate responsibility, said, "we are thrilled to welcome Serena, a longtime advocate and role model for so many, to the Purple Purse family. Her voice will bring new audiences into this critical conversation."[480]
Other charitable organizations Williams supports include the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Hearts of Gold, the Common Ground Foundation, the Small Steps Project, the HollyRod Foundation, Beyond the Boroughs National Scholarship Fund, World Education, the Eva Longoria Foundation, the Caliber Foundation and the Cure for MND Foundation.[481][482]

Writing
The Williams sisters, with author Hilary Beard, wrote a book titled Venus & Serena: Serving From The Hip: 10 Rules For Living, Loving and Winning, which was published in 2005.[483][484] During the 2009 Wimbledon Championships, Williams said that she was in the process of writing a TV show storyline, which would be converted into script form by her agency. She stated that the show would represent subject matter from a mix of popular American television shows such as Desperate Housewives and Family Guy.[485] Williams released her first solo autobiography, entitled On the Line, following the 2009 US Open.[citation needed]

Soccer
On July 21, 2020, Williams was announced as part of a nearly all-women investors' group that was awarded a new franchise in the National Women's Soccer League, the top level of the women's sport in the U.S. The new team began play in 2022 as Angel City FC. Her husband Alexis Ohanian is classified as the "lead investor", but he holds a minority interest, and is the only male in the ownership group. Other announced owners include several prominent actresses and media figures, two businesswomen, 14 former members of the U.S. women's national team, and her daughter.[486]

“Even better to find that they’re so cool and down to earth as people,” he added. “Like meeting long lost cousins at a family gathering, only they just happen to be, in my opinion, the best to ever grace a tennis court, as well as being genuine AIC fans. Awesome night.”
Advertisement In his own post, Inez wrote that Venus “stood in the front of us singing all the songs” during the set, and Serena was on his side alongside his bass tech. “Seemed like everyone needed to rock the fuck out after Hurricane Ian blew through,” he added. See their posts, along with Cantrell’s, below:
