At the 2005 Nickelodeon Kid’s Choice Awards,Will Smith said, “The reason that reading is so important, there have been millions and billions and billions and gazillions of people that have lived before all of us, there’s no new problem you can have, with your parents, with school, with a bully, with anything.
There’s no problem you can have that someone hasn’t already solved and wrote about it in a book.”If reading is one of the keys to success, Will Smith must read a lot.

Rags-to-riches stories fool us because although they may be factually true—you may start your life poor and finish it rich—they leave out all the advantages of circumstances that contribute to success.
Further, they make us believe that success is an individual achievement.
But no one succeeds alone.
InOutliers, Malcolm Gladwell shows us that where you’re from and the opportunities you’re given matter as much as personal advantages such as talent and intelligence.On USA Today,Will Smith mentioned he was reading Gladwell’sOutliers, explaining, “he talks about the concept of 10,000 hours.
That you don’t really settle into any level of mastery until 10,000 hours, and I feel like I’ve just completed my 10,000 hours of story structure and filmmaking.” Clearly, the idea of 10,000 hours of focused practice spoke to him, making this one of the best of Will Smith’s book recommendations.The Alchemist, by Paulo CoelhoIn this fable about following your heart and self-discovery, a shepherd boy named Santiago sets out on a quest for hidden treasure.
The treasure he ultimately finds is not the treasure he was looking for–and it’s a far better treasure than he ever could have hoped for.On the Tavis Smiley Show,Will Smith shared what he learned fromThe Alchemist: “I believe that I can create whatever I want to create.…I feel very strongly that we are who we choose to be.”The Alchemistis one of the most cited Will Smith book recommendations.Rich Dad, Poor Dad, by Robert T. KiyosakiTITLE: Rich Dad Poor DadAUTHOR: Robert T. KiyosakiTIME: 18READS: 34.6IMG_URL: https://www.shortform.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/richdadpoordad_cover.jpgBOOK_SUMMARYURL: rich-dad-poor-dad-summary-robert-kiyosakiAMZN_ID: B07C7M8SX9Rich Dad, Poor Dadis one of the best-selling financial books in history, selling over 35 million copies.
The premise: when growing up, author Robert Kiyosaki had two dads advising him: 1) a Stanford-educated PhD who followed traditional career thinking and was financially illiterate (the Poor Dad, his biological father); 2) a high school dropout who built a business empire employing thousands (the Rich Dad, his best friend’s father).The two dads are a parable for two different approaches to wealth: Poor Dad recommends getting a secure job with good benefits and retiring with a pension.
Rich Dad recommends amassing assets that make money for you, becoming financially literate, and practicing independent thinking.In this book, learn how to achieve financial independence, why it’s a terrible idea to see your home as your biggest investment, and how to overcome the biggest mental blocks to becoming wealthy.In an interview with Oprah,Will Smith said he asked his kids to readRich Dad, Poor Dad:“I want them to be able to have a financial comprehension to not be slaves to working and money…the way that my mind has been for a really long time.” He said, “No matter how successful you get, it’s really difficult to shake your mindset, and I still have a ‘poor person’ mentality, I can’t shake it, and it gets really detrimental….When I go to sleep, right now, I’m as financially nervous as I was 20 years ago.” Because his children are growing up in a different financial book than he is, Will Smith recommended this book to help them understand other financial realities.Will Smith’s Book Recommendations: 3 That Changed His LifeWant to fast-track your learning?

He’s Really Good at MathDeep down inside, Will Smith is secretly a nerd!
He has publicly stated that if he wasn’t an actor, he’d be a computer engineer!
His favorite subject in school was math and he was actually quite good at it.
If I weren’t a musician/actor, I’d be a computer engineer.
I was always good at math.
I probably would have been the guy who invented the remote control if I’d been around then,” he said.
Smith didn’t go to post-secondary school, but if he did he said he would have likely gone to MIT.
That’s a bold statement!
I had pretty high SAT scores and they needed black kids, so I probably could have gotten in.
But I had no intention of going to college,” he said in an interview with the Readers Digest back in 2006.
He didn’t want to go to college because by high school he already knew he was destined for greatness.
He released his first record in high school and when he graduated, the deal with his parents was that he’d spend a year making music and then he would go to college; of course he never followed through with the second part of the bargain.Things You Didn't Know About Prince Harry38.
Trouble with the IRSIn the late ’80s, Smith was experiencing success as a musician and was becoming financially success in his early twenties.
Unfortunately, he was also extremely irresponsible with his finances and would spend money freely.
In 1988 and 1989 he underpaid his taxes and so the Internal Revenue Service assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against him.
They took many of his possessions and he nearly went bankrupt.
Things turned around for Smith in 1990 when he was offered a contract with NBC to build a sitcom.
The only reason Will Smith agreed to take on the lead role inThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Airwas because he owed all this money to the IRS.
During the first three seasons of the show he was forced to hand over 70 percent of his pay check.RexThings You Didn't Know About Princess Diana47.

How He Met JadaWill Smith met his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, on the set ofThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
She auditioned for the role of his love interest, but she didn’t get the part.
Instead it went to Nia Long, but lucky for Jada, she got the part off set!
Will and Jada kept in touch afterwards and once they had formed a friendship, they began dating.
Initially Jada didn’t understand Will’s sense of humor, but she soon changed her mind.
They were married in 1997 and had their first child together a year later.
The couple now have two children together, Jaden, 18, and Willow, 15.
Their relationship has been riddled with rumors of infidelity or that they have an open marriage, but together they’ve never addressed these rumors.
What fuels the rumors are their responses to these tabloids.
For example, Will was quoted in the Daily Mail as saying: “Our perspective is, you don’t avoid what’s natural.
You’re going to be attracted to people.
In our marriage vows, we didn’t say ‘foresaking all others.’ The vow that we made was that you will never hear that I did something after the fact.
If it came down to it, then one can say to the other, ‘Look, I need to have sex with somebody.
I’m not going to if you don’t approve of it – but please approve of it.

DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh PrinceWill started becoming successful as a musician when he was in high school and after he graduated he took some time off to pursue a career in music.
When he was 16-years-old he met Jeffrey Townes at a party and they became fast friends.
One key thing about their friendship was that they both shared an interest in music.
So when he graduated, he joined forces with his childhood friends, Jeff and Clarence Holmes, and created the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince.
Smith was the MC, Jeff was a turntablist and producer and Clarence, also known as “Ready Rock C,” was the human beat box.
The group did incredibly well gaining critical acclaim.
They won the first Grammy ever awarded in the Rap category in 1988 for their song “Summertime.”Things You Didn't Know About Queen Elizabeth83.
Sheree ZampinoToday, Will Smith is happily married to Jada Pinkett Smith and has been for quite some time.
But some might have forgotten he was actually married before he met Jada.
Smith met Sheree Zampino at a taping for the movieA Different Worldin 1991.
She was a fashion design student at the time.
Their marriage didn’t last long, and the two got divorced in 1995.
They had one son together, Willard Smith III (Trey Smith), born on November 11, 1992.
Smith has publicly stated that he regrets his first divorce and that he could have tried harder to make it work.
That is probably the most painful loss of my life.
I quit.
I could have fixed it.
It really was not that bad,” he said.
These two have managed to maintain a friendly relationship while raising their son.Things You Might Not Know About Prince Philip92.
He Doesn’t Believe in Traditional EducationJada and Will Smith have made the conscious decision to not send their two children, Jaden and Willow, into the traditional school system.
This isn’t unusual for celebrities who want to avoid putting their children into the spotlight or into a school system where they might be treated differently, but the Smith’s decision isn’t based on that.
It’s because they don’t believe their children will be taught what they need to learn.
Of course, there are the basics that they understand are necessary, but they have a different idea of what children should be learning in school.
The things that have been most valuable to me I did not learn in school.
Traditional education is based on facts and figures and passing tests – not on a comprehension of the material and its application to your life.
Jada and I homeschool our children, because the date of the Boston Tea Party does not matter…We have hired teachers who teach what we feel is important.
For example, Plato’s Republic — kids need to know that.
Why is that not taught in first grade?
You cannot be American without reading it and Aristotle’s Politics.
That is what the forefathers of this country read, and they used them to create what I believe is the finest system of government that has ever existed,” said Smith.Photo Works/Shutterstock.comThings You Might Not Know About Melissa Joan Hart101.
He Learned How to Act on Fresh PrinceWhen Will took on the role as himself inThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Airhe didn’t know how to act.
During an interview with TIME Magazine, the executive producer for the show, Quincy Jones said, “Will had never acted before Fresh Prince, but after a 15-minute read through, we knew he was our guy.” Smith picked it up pretty quickly because he was used to being a performer.
The only tricky part was knowing his lines and he admits that in the beginning he used to memorize the entire script to help him remember his own: “then I’d be lipping everybody’s lines while they were talking.” Today, he’s become one of the better actors in the business and now when he looks back, like most of us, he’s totally embarrassed.
When I watch those episodes, it’s disgusting.
My performances were horrible,” he said.
He was merely taking on the role because he needed the money and the network wanted to develop a show for him.

It’s still unclear how skilled he is with this instrument since we only got to see him play it in one brief scene fromThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.Will Smith’s Piano SceneIf you’ve ever wondered if Will Smith can play a piano, it’s probably because you’ve seen him do it on the hit sitcomThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
His piano scene was featured inthe very first episodeof this beloved series, and he performed a rendition of Ludwig van Beethoven’s composition“Für Elise”.The main point of this scene was to shift the dynamics between Will and his Uncle Phil.
They had a tense relationship from the start because Will’s “flippant shenanigans” didn’t sit well with Uncle Phil, but hearing him play the piano showed the older man that they still have a lot to learn about each other.This was the only time we got to see Smith play this instrument, since none of his other projects required him to do it again.

But when I sat down, Ifacedthe piano, and began playing Mom-Mom’s favorite, Beethoven’s ‘Für Elise’.”Read more:Will Smith sings ‘Prince Ali’ in this new clip from Aladdin – here’s the musical analysisJames Avery and Will Smith on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.Picture:
AlamyThe tense scene begins with Smith’s character exchanging tense words with Uncle Phil, as Smith accuses his uncle of forgetting his roots and where he comes from.Phil replies, “Before you criticise somebody, you find out what he’s all about”, and ends the conversation by leaving Smith alone in the room after he refuses to listen to Smith’s side of story, therefore not taking his own advice.When Smith starts playing the piano after his uncle has left, Phil returns to the doorway, unbeknownst to Smith’s character.He watches on in subdued shock for a few moments, as he realises he may have misjudged Smith, and taps his hand thoughtfully against the doorframe as if he’s going to say something, before leaving once again.The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air ran from 1990-1996.Picture:
GettyPrior to the scene, Smith says that no one in the cast knew that the actor had previously had piano lessons.
So when he started playing, “the set went silent as everyone realized this show was about to be special”.Smith recalls: “The point of the scene had been to never judge a book by its cover.
The producers were so inspired by this improvisational moment that they kept it, and it became the defining thematic premise of the entire series.”And fans are in agreement with this inspirational moment.
One commenter on an upload of the scene to YouTube remarks, “I love the ending of this scene.
Uncle Phil sees potential in Will and misjudged him like he told Will not to.”To find out that this heartfelt ending is completely improvised is just one of the reasons the show remains a beloved fan-favourite, and it’s easy to see how the show quickly became America’s highest-rated new sitcom in its first season.Beethoven latestSee moreBeethoven latestBeethoven’s Symphony No.5 fills Printworks in Aurora Orchestra’s thrilling immersiveconcertScientific analysis of Beethoven’s DNA reveals he had Hepatitis B and high risk ofliver diseaseThe 20 best piano concertos of all timeDiscover MusicIf Beethoven was completely deaf, how did he compose music?McDonald’s restaurant in Wales to play Beethoven to tackle late-night antisocial behaviourListen to this 10,000-strong Japanese megachoir sing Beethoven’s ‘Ode to Joy’LeBron James reveals he listens to Beethoven to ‘calm down’ before gamesOrchestra’s outer space Beethoven performance leaves legendary conductor in tearsSeiji OzawaWhat are the lyrics to ‘Ode to Joy’, Beethoven’s triumphant choral anthem?When Daniel Barenboim, Yo-Yo Ma and Anne-Sophie Mutter combined to gift us achinglybeautiful BeethovenDaniel BarenboimBest classical musicSee moreBest classical musicThe 15 most famous tunes in classical musicDiscover MusicThe 15 greatest symphonies of all timeDiscover MusicThe 4 eras of classical music: a quick guideDiscover Music21 of the greatest women composers in classical musicDiscover MusicThe 25 best pianists of all timeDiscover MusicThe 10 most romantic opera duets of all timeDiscover MusicLatest on Classic FMUnruly singing audience members at ‘The Bodyguard’ spark musical theatre etiquette debateThis week’s Classic FM radio highlights – including Album of the Week and Drive DiscoveryRachmaninov’s Piano Concerto No.2 tops Classic FM Hall of Fame in composer’s 150thanniversary yearClassic FM Hall of FameWe’re counting down the Classic FM Hall of Fame 2023!

The 1990 pilot of "Fresh Prince" centered on Smith's character having a fish-out-of-water experience as he left his hometown of West Philadelphia to live with his Uncle Phil (James Avery), Aunt Viv (Janet Hubert), and three cousins in their lavish Bel-Air mansion.The episode showed Will's lack of decorum, bold fashion sense, and constant use of slang like "dope" — all of which contrasted with the posh lifestyle of the Banks family.
At the end of the episode, Uncle Phil scolded Will for making a spectacle of himself at an elegant dinner.After exchanging terse words, Uncle Phil told Will, "Before you criticize somebody, you find out what he's all about."
Then he dismissed Will's attempt to share his side of the story, saying that he knew exactly what his nephew was about.Uncle Phil was proven wrong though as Will went over to the piano and unexpectedly began playing the classic Beethoven tune "Für Elise."
The surprising moment caused Uncle Phil to pop back into the living room and smile as he listened.Will Smith improvised on the series premiere of "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
NBCIn chapter three of hisself-titled memoir, released on Tuesday, Smith said that when he filmed the pilot, he was originally supposed to sit at the bench and look pensive.
But he went off-script and the moment ended up illustrating that Uncle Phil misjudged Will.
The producers had originally planned on me sitting with my back to the piano so they could push the camera in on my face as I pondered the profundity of Uncle Phil's closing words," Smith wrote.
But when I sat down, Ifacedthe piano, and began playing Mom-Mom's favorite, Beethoven's 'Für Elise.
Unbeknownst to the cast and crew, Smith had previously taken piano lessons because his mother, Carolyn Bright, played and it "was the only instrument that actually liked me.

23, 2022Every Will Smith Movie Performance, RankedByWill LeitchandTim GriersonPhoto-Illustration: Emily Denniston/Vulture and photos courtesy of the studiosThis article has been updated to include Smith’s recent films.Will we ever stop talking aboutthe Slap?
Will Smith has been one of the biggest movie stars on the planet for more than two decades now — the very definition of an American success story in just about every possible way — and yet, one night in March, at an awards ceremony that should have been the culmination of his incredible career, everything changed.
Smith went from the man everyone couldn’t wait to cheer for winning his first Oscar to a manbanned from the eventfor the next decade.Whether or not all that is fair or unfair will remain a hotly contested debate — it feels like we’ll be yelling at each other about the Slap for decades — but it has unquestionably blurred public perception of just how varied, ambitious and fascinating Smith’s many performances have been.
But you shouldn’t deny the scope of Smith’s career.
From youthful rap toThe Fresh Prince of Bel-AirtoIndependence Dayto global domination, Smith was on you so fast you barely had time to register that he’d taken over the world.
And, at least until the Slap, he remained likable and relatable, even when his star has taken a dip or two.
He even managed to still be charming inSuicide Squad, which one would have thought impossible.And don’t think he doesn’t have depth, either, playing “serious” roles in both dramas (Ali)and four-quadrant blockbusters (I Am Legend).
Even with his missteps,Smithremains the sort of movie star you just don’t see anymore.
With the release ofEmancipation,his first post-Slap movie, we went back and ranked all of his movie performances.33.After Earth(2013)The debacle that prompted Smith to take an 18-month hiatus from acting,After Earthreally is as bad as you remember: an overly ponderous, drag-ass sci-fi action-drama in which Will’s son Jaden wholly lacks the charisma that made his dad a mega-star.
What undoubtedly made its failure harder on Smith was that he had dreamed up the original story and thrust his son into the central role, figuring it would propel him up the Hollywood food chain.
Maybe that’s why Smith looks so glum throughout the film: He seems to be realizing in real time what a bad ideaAfter Earthwas.32.Collateral Beauty(2016)Yeah, it’s the complete misguided mess that you’ve heard it is, but all told, it’s more embarrassing for Edward Norton, Michael Pena, and Kate Winslet — who play the awful human beings meant to be the “good guys” of this bewildering “heartwarmer” — than it is for Smith, who is mostly put-upon and thus escapes the true awfulness.
The real problem with Smith here is one that’s common to many of his “serious” performances: He turns down the star wattage that we love about Will Smith and turns mopey and morose.
There are already enough mopey and morose actors: There’s no need for you to be one, Will.
Though to be fair: It’s possible he realized the dog of a movie he was in and just couldn’t work up any smiles anyway.31.Men in Black II(2002)Everything that was terrific about the firstMen in Black— the witty premise, the hip tone, the oil-and-vinegar rapport between Smith and Tommy Lee Jones — evaporates in this strained, unfunny sequel.
Where Smith’s Agent J was once an awesome smartass,Men in Black IIpresents him as just a smug dick.
This is the first time Smith seemed to take a movie precisely because he needed a hit — which, in the wake ofWild Wild West, was the case.30.Seven Pounds(2008)The infamous Jellyfish movie.
This is the closest Smith ever came to John Travolta’sBattlefield Earthterritory, a personal project that’s a nightmare to sit through and seriously made you wonder for a second if Smith had some sort of Jesus complex.
And seriously:Watch that jellyfish scene:29.Wild Wild West(1999)This really did make sense at the time.
Barry Sonnenfeld of theMen in Blackfilms, Kevin Kline as the trusty sidekick, and a sci-fi-meets-Western premise.
But, wow, did it ever go wrong.
Starting with that terrible theme song.
We bet Smith would like that one back.)
Pandering, chaotic, disorganized Hollywood filmmaking at its worst.
The one true big-budget flop of Smith’s career, and you can’t say it doesn’t earn the designation.28.Bright(2017)The infamous Netflix fiasco — and by “fiasco” we mean “millions of people vaguely paid attention to it while folding laundry” — is pretty terrible, maybe even worse than Ayer’s much-deridedSuicideSquad.
But the worst part is how checked out Smith is here.
The one thing you can usually count on is Smith giving it his all, even in lousy material.
Here, he looks like he’s perpetually glancing off-screen to see if his Netflix check has cashed.
The duo are a deadly mix: This is a near-nadir for him.27.Where the Day Takes You(1991)What’s it like when a seemingly random smattering of early ‘90s up-and-coming young “stars” all don’t take a bath for a day and pretend to be “troubled” drug addicts on the streets of Los Angeles?
Well, it looks like a movie-of-the-week with everybody wearing flannel.
Seriously, check out this crazy cast: Dermot Mulroney, Sean Astin, Lara Flynn Boyle, Christian Slater, David Arquette, Nancy McKeon, Alyssa Milano,Ricki Lake!
Smith, in his first film, plays Manny, a legless homeless kid who mostly shows up to be friendly, move a wheelchair quickly, and get beaten up.
Fortunately, Smith would be out of these roles very soon.26.Winter’s Tale(2014)Smith has just a small part in this Akiva Goldman misfire, but it’s a super silly one: He plays the devil!
He doesn’t do a lot of devilish things, but he does do this:25.Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues(2013)We had kinda forgotten he was in this, too.
Or, maybe we just wanted to forget: Smith is part of the epic, lame battle royale that happens near the end of this just-good-enough sequel.
He’s the anchor of the ESPN crew, and his cameo consists mostly of a goofy early-’80s hairdo.
And what’s with his voice?
Is he trying to make his character sound prissy or nerdy or what?
Don’t feel too bad, Will: Everybody in this scene — Tina Fey, Kanye West, Jim Carrey — comes off badly.24.The Legend of Bagger Vance(2000)A classic“Magical Negro” rolethat Smith was able to avoid the rest of his career, this is a low point for both Smith and director Robert Redford.
The role is beneath Will Smith, and really beneath any prominent black actor; it’s impossible to imagine it being made today.
Seriously, watch this again: You’ll be pretty taken aback.
It was also the last film of Jack Lemmon.
23.Suicide Squad(2016)Well, you certainly can’t blame Smith foreverything that goes wrong withSuicide Squad, and at the very least, he’s a reason to keep watching when the movie is flapping all over the place and running into walls.
He and Robbie are the only people who seem to have put much thought into what went onscreen, and for that, we must express our gratefulness.
And then run out of the theater.22.Bad Boys for Life(2020)This entirely unnecessary sequel is basically a cleaned-up, duller version of either of the first two movies.
There’s nothing offensive in it, nothing Smith will cringe when he watches in 20 years, but nothing particularly interesting either.
For all of Michael Bay’s Michael Bay-ness, he at least keeps his movies moving and kinetic.
Directors Adil and Bilall, while dutiful and energetic, can inspire no such energy from either of their leading men.
It’s funny that people talked about this movie happening for 20 years and then immediately forgot about it when it happened.21.Bad Boys II(2003)Smith didn’t have to do this sequel — he was already the biggest movie star on the planet at this point — and he probably should have stayed away.
This is Michael Bay trying maybe a little too much comedy, to the point that the opening sequence takes place at a Klan rally in which Martin Lawrence gets shot in the butt.
It goes downhill from there, but Smith somehow keeps it afloat, largely because he’s Will Smith and has an internal governor that won’t let him sink too low.20.Jersey Girl(2004)Yes, Will Smith was in a Kevin Smith movie.
Only briefly, though.
This brief, and ill-fated, attempt by Kevin Smith to become a Serious Hollywood Filmmaker fell on its face — to be fair, it would have difficult for anything to survive Bennifer — but it’s worth pointing out that Smith has a wonderful little cameo here.
Playing himself, he comes across Ben Affleck’s character in a hospital waiting room and provides the film its only genuine moment, in which he and Affleck share a moment of understanding and commiseration that feels earned.
It’s also funny how Smith plays himself.
Unlike most movie stars, who feel the need to send up their persona, Smith is just how he sees himself, and maybe how he actually is: A laid-back guy who’s living the best life and can’t believe how lucky he is.
Few movie stars have felt so comfortable in their own skin.
You see that surprisingly well here.19.Aladdin(2019)After the initialAladdintrailer, which revealed Will Smith as theBig Blue Dude, received less-than-stellar responses from the internet, it was reasonable to go into this live-action remake with major worries.
Lowered expectations are probably for the best: The new movie isn’t terrible, although it’s certainly a far cry from the original.
Ditto Smith as the jovial genie.
Weirdly, for all the hits he’s been a part of over the decades, he’s rarely done what you’d call a straight-up family film, outside of maybeShark Tale, so it’s interesting to see him tap into his big-kid gusto in such a pronounced way.
Still, anyone attempting to outdo Robin Williams is asking for trouble, so it’s just as well that Smith doesn’t try, mostly playing the character as the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air all grown up.
Too much of thisAladdinseems designed chiefly to make money, and likewise Smith’s performance is profoundly efficient — it’s a somewhat impressive technical and creative feat that no one really needed.18.Focus(2015)Smith is extremely fun as a con man — the first con man he’d played sinceSix Degrees of Separation20 years earlier, a movie that strikes a very different pitch — in a movie that never quite figures out whether it’s a heist comedy, a dark thriller, orsomething.He has obvious rapport with Margot Robbie, which would carry over to a worse movie inSuicide Squad, and, as usual, he effortlessly gets the audience on his side.
The story has too many twists and turns to be taken seriously, but it’s worth it just to hang out.17.Concussion(2015)Smith’s best straight-drama performance since 2006’sThe Pursuit of Happynessfinds him playing Bennet Omalu, a soft-spoken Nigerian doctor living in Pittsburgh who helped uncover the traumatic brain injuries devastating NFL players.
It’s a modest portrayal without much in the way of actorly fireworks, and the two-time Oscar nominee leans heavily on his quiet decency.
When you’re among the most charismatic humans on the planet, that’s more than enough.16.Made in America(1993)The concept of this movie is so inherently bizarre — Whoopi Goldberg discovers that the father of the child she conceived from a sperm donor is dumbass car salesman Ted Danson — that you look for any sort of escape.
And you certainly find it in Smith, who plays the love interest of the daughter (Nia Long) with such movie-star charm that he practically leaps off the screen.
He wouldn’t have to play silly comic-relief supporting roles much longer, but, man, was he ever good at it.
He’s so exuberant and having such a blast that it almost makes you forget Goldberg’s and Danson’s real-life relationship.
Almost.15.Hitch(2005)The sort of dumb studio rom-com that goes as far as its star will take it,Hitchsuggests what Smith’s career might have been like if he’d taken the Matthew McConaughey route.
He plays a suave relationship adviser who counsels dorky Kevin James on how to talk to a pretty gal (Amber Valletta) — so, of course, he’s nervous in his own life trying to woo assertive gossip columnist Eva Mendes!
Yeah, like we said,Hitchis dumb, but it’s dumb in a fluffy, appealing way, and Smith gets to work that 1,000-watt smile while playing the romantic lead — something he hasn’t done much at the movies.14.Bad Boys(1995)Smith and director Michael Bay teamed up when both men were on a career upswing, andBad Boyswas the very appealing (and, yes, sorta racist and homophobic) result.
This is where the Fresh Prince graduates to big-screen badass action hero, setting the stage forIndependence Day,Men in Blackand the title of King of the Fourth of July Blockbuster.
What’s funny about watchingBad Boysnow: Dude seemsso young, but his smartass chemistry with Martin Lawrence still shines.13.GeminiMan(2019)Will Smith is up for the challenge of battling (and of course eventually teaming up) with his 30-years-younger clone, but even he can’t overcome this hoary, aging-hit-man story that’s so tired that it’s a borderline miracle he doesn’t once say “I’m too old for this shit.” (And don’t get us started on Ang Lee’s insistence on the accelerated FPS rate, which makes the whole thing look like the most expensive episode ofAs the World Turnsever.)
Fortunately, Smith is still dedicated enough to sell the dynamic between his two selves, and there are even some moving moments in which you see him struggling to reckon with his younger self, both onscreen and off.
But if you’re going to re-create a young Will Smith … don’t you have to make him more fun than this?12.Men in Black 3(2012)This was the first movie Smith made after 2008’sHancockandSeven Pounds, and the four years away from multiplexes only reminded us how much we loved the guy.Men in Black 3washes away the bad memories of the 2002 sequel, pairing Smith mostly with Josh Brolin, who’s playing Tommy Lee Jones’s Agent K in the past.
The time-jumping narrative and Brolin’s spot-on Jones impression are the movie’s highlights, which allows Smith to ease back into movie-star mode, supplying Agent J with endless cool and still-stellar comic timing.11.I, Robot(2004)A fairly basic thriller that hasn’t aged particularly well — unlike the Isaac Asimov book it’s based on — and feels compromised, not least of which by some truly bizarre product placement.
Smith can play this sort of Wry Cop in his sleep, but he’s a steadying force among all the chaos around him.
He’s also a surprisingly urgent action star: He’s physical, sure, but also vulnerable and insistent.
He makes it look easier than it is.10.Enemy of the State(1998)This Tony Scott action-thriller came out during Smith’s bulletproof period where he could do no wrong.
Spoiler alert:The following year’sWild Wild Westwould end that streak.)
He’s not the cool cat or the cocky showboat this time, though: He plays a mild-mannered lawyer mixed up in a government conspiracy, with only Gene Hackman’s mysterious operative able to save him.Enemy of the Statewas Smith’s dry run for the dramatic roles he would soon be pursuing, and he’s commanding and sympathetic as a regular guy fighting for his life.9.Hancock(2008)Smith’s nerviest blockbuster finds him playing a superhero who’s also an asshole, and the actor seems tickled at the prospect of tweaking his own squeaky-clean image.Hancockdoesn’t always balance its desire to be a dark satire of comic-book movies with its need to deliver supersized, put-asses-in-the-seats spectacle.
But Smith finds the nuance and pain in an all-powerful character who can save the world but can’t get out of his own way.8.Emancipation(2022)Smith’s first post-Slap movie was almost not released, and it does seem a little buried on Apple TV.
While director Antoine Fuqua’s approach to the heady material is a little more action-movie glib than you might like (does a movie about an escaping slave really need a scene where he fights an alligator?
 Smith makes up for it with an oft-wordless performance in which his pure physicality and presence carries the entire movie.
This is hisRevenant, but Smith is less showy than DiCaprio; he simply invests this man with gravity, and a spine of cement, that is all the weight the film needs.7.The Pursuit of Happyness(2006)One of the hardest things for A-list stars to do is portray “ordinary” people.
Stay too long in the limelight and you lose the common touch.)
But Smith earned his second Best Actor nomination effortlessly playing Chris Gardner, who in the early 1980s fell into homelessness while raising his young son (Smith’s own son Jaden).
There’s nothing showy in Smith’s performance, which is crucial for a character who’s been beaten down by life but still clings to a defiant optimism.
Smith’s obvious affection for his boy radiates through the screen.6.Six Degrees of Separation(1995)This adaptation of John Guare’s Pulitzer Prize–winning play had all the Appeal to the Smart Upper East Side Crowd cachet a young actor looking to make a splash would want, but what’s stunning is how much fire and passion Smith brings to the performance, at times wiping seasoned vets Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing right off the screen.
Smith is a little mannered at first as a grifter who cons a cultured NYC couple into believing he’s Sidney Poitier’s son, but once his ruse is discovered, he, and the film, turn into something much more raw and searing.
Even if you found Smith charming before this, his performance snapped you to attention: Wait, he can dothis?In some ways, he hasn’t quite challenged himself as much since.5.Independence Day(1996)This sequeldidn’t bring back Smith, and it left a huge crater at its center: Would we have ever made this such a big hit, would we have ever cared so much, if it hadn’t have been for Smith?
The movie is fairly standard disaster-flick porn — albeit done in Roland Emmerich’s harmlessly dumb style — but Smith springs it to life every time he shows up.
No wonder he became such a July 4 star: This is America how we want to see ourselves, a little John Wayne, a little Muhammad Ali.
Welcome to Earth!4.I Am Legend(2007)The movie never quite figures out its ending — andthe initial ending, from the book but rejected by test audiences, might have been a better place to land — but Smith is incredibly moving as a man who has lost everyone he loved and knew but still, in spite of himself, keeps trudging forward.
It’s a tricky performance, and its strength is in Smith’s unwillingness to ever go for the easy out: You can tell he’s invested in what a man like this would go through, and he appears legitimately damaged from it.
Not everything in this movie works, but it might be Smith’s most underappreciated performance.3.Ali(2001)Muhammad Ali’s death may have brought newfound appreciation to this deeply moving, under-loved biopic, but the greatness of Smith’s performance was never in dispute.Alimerges the two sides of this dynamic actor — the electric entertainer and the soulful dramatist — into one perfect whole, presenting the iconic boxer as the ultimate showman who was also sensitive to (and swept up in) the political and racial turmoil swirling around him.
Earning his first Oscar nomination, Smith uses his charisma like a weapon, tapping into Ali’s sting-like-a-bee magnetism.2.Men in Black(1997)Sure, the man is a superb dramatic performer.
But be honest:Thisis the movie — and character — you first think of when someone mentions Will Smith.Men in Blackis a miracle of a blockbuster — a snazzy, funny, eye-popping sci-fi action movie — and Smith treats the whole enterprise like one big lark.
No movie star makes blasé irreverence feel hipper, just as no other movie star makes event movies feel like the coolest thing in the world.
You know what?Hedidmake this look good.1.King Richard(2021)Richard Williams is, in every possible way, unreasonable.
He’s stubborn, incorrigible, obnoxious, and so certain of his own virtue and judgment that everyone who deals with him ends up wanting to pull their hair out.
Someone’s going to make a great supercut of this film featuring only people’s exasperated reactions to him.)
The thing is, though, somehow he turns out to be right about everything.
This authorized but hardly hagiographic biopic of Williams, who famously told the world that his two little daughters would grow up to be the best tennis players in the world, and thenthey were, is a stirring, uplifting sports movie, sure — it will definitely make your kids want to go outside and play some tennis — but it’s also an incredible showcase for Smith, who plays Williams as an unmovable object: The parent as impenetrable fortress, an advocate for his kids often in the face of any good sense.
Smith’s Williams is a force of nature — charming, narcissistic, prideful, wounded, fiercely protective, and gloriously impossible.
And again, he turns out to be right about everything.
Smith clearly feels a kinship with this man, and it results in the best performance of his career.Grierson & Leitch write about the movies regularly for theNew Republicand host apodcast on film.

For the best, I think it is a tie between the first Men in Black andThe Pursuit of Happyness," Smith said in a recent interview withGQ(opens in new tab).
For different reasons, those are the two almost perfect movies.
Men in Black was released in 1997 and the sci-fi comedy follows the titular secret organization that supervises alien lifeforms who live on Earth and hides their existence from humans.
The movie has a rating of 92% on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, the highest of all Smith's movies.
Two sequels followed 2002 and 2012, but these are... not as highly rated, shall we say.The Pursuit of Happyness followed in 2006 and sees Smith play a homeless salesman and the father to his real-life son, Jaden.
He was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his performance.And as for his worst movie?
For worst, I don't know, Wild Wild West is just a thorn in my side," Smith added.
To see myself with chaps… I don't like it."
The steampunk Western came out in 1999 and was the most expensive movie ever made at the time of its release (when costs are adjusted for inflation).
It didn't do well at the box office and won five Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture.
Worst of all, Smith passed on a leading role in The Matrix to appear in Wild Wild West.Smith's next big-screen outing should be more successful, however – he plays the lead in King Richard, which centers around the father of tennis superstars Serena and Venus Williams.
The movie arrives in theaters and on HBO Max on November 19.

If you shop from one of our links, we may earn a commission.We all want our kids to eat more produce, but convincing them to actually eat what we buy can be hard!
This master list of fruit will help you learn which fruits for kids have the most nutrition, are easy for kids to eat, and are most likely to actually be eaten.
Plus, recipe ideas for how to use them.List of Fruits for KidsFruit is full of vitamins, minerals, and fiber—and they taste good!
It’s so easy to get into a rut of buying just apples, bananas, and oranges at the store, so this list of fruit for kids will give you new ideas.My goal is to both keep the kids interested in actually eating their fruit AND will help ensure that they’re getting a healthy range of nutrients throughout the week.Contentshide1List of Fruits for Kids2Healthy Fruit for Kids3Best Fruits for Toddlers4Apple5Apricots6Avocado7Banana8Blueberries9Cantaloupe10Cherries11Citrus12Cranberries13Figs14Grapes15Honeydew16Kiwi17Mango18Peaches19Pear20Pineapple21Plums22Pomegranate23Raspberries24Strawberries25Watermelon26Final Notes on this List of Fruits for KidsHealthy Fruit for KidsI always remind parents that kids who don’t love their veggies should be encouraged to enjoy fruit since they contain many of the same nutrients!
The water content can also be really helpful in making sure that the kids don’t become constipated (which is an important thing to keep in mind because a kid who can’t go is a miserable kiddo).They are also naturally sweet and are usually much more enjoyable for many kids than veggies.Best Fruits for ToddlersThis list of fruits includes a wide range because pretty much any fruit is good for toddlers—you really don’t need to worry about the natural sugar content (promise).
There are some considerations to take withchoking hazardsand chewing abilities, so you’ll see that info below.Use the following list for ideas on how to serve fruits for kids raw and how to cook some of my favorite fruit recipes too.You can find my list of fruits serving sizes in myResource Library here.AppleRaw apples can be achoking hazardup until age 4 if cut into chunks, though use your discretion if you want to offer them earlier and opt for softer varieties like Gala when possible.You can also serve raw apples shredded to younger toddlers, which is much easier to chew.
Also try these recipes for apples below.Simple Sauteed Apples with CinnamonYou can use any type of apple you have or like, though generally tart cooking apples (like Granny Smith or Pink Lady) soften nicely without falling apart too quickly.Get the recipeSo Easy Sliced Baked ApplesWe like these apples warm or cold out of the fridge, so see what your kids like best!Get the recipeInstant Pot ApplesauceYou can peel or not peel the apples, depending on your preference.Get the recipeEasy Crockpot ApplesauceWith just a few basic ingredients and fresh apples, your crock pot can do the rest of the work of making applesauce!Get the recipeApple Cinnamon Oatmeal with RaisinsYou can double this recipe to make a larger batch to warm up and serve throughout the week.Get the recipeFavorite Apple Baked OatmealThis Apple Baked Oatmeal is delicious and hearty.
It's delicate when warm, so let it cool fully before you slice it with a serrated knife.
Serve it in slices like you would apple bread, or in a bowl to eat with a spoon or a fork.Get the recipeMini Applesauce MuffinsWe like these on their own, topped with nut or seed butter, or even with a smear of cream cheese.
See what your littles like!Get the recipeFresh Apple PancakesThese apple pancakes are hearty and filled with freshly shredded apples and oats, so expect them to have a lot of texture!Get the recipeFluffy Applesauce PancakesWe like these pancakes topped with a little maple syrup, peanut butter, or additional applesauce.
Leftovers make really yummy sandwiches with nut butter or cream cheese in between!Get the recipeApricotsPutting together a list of fruits wouldn’t be complete without apricots!
Fresh apricots can be hard to find if you live in a smaller town like we do, but when they’re in season and good, they’re a delicious fruit for kids!They’re a very good option for toddler constipation and are a nice alternative to fruits like peaches and plums if you’re looking for variety.You want to look for ones that give just slightly—if they are super firm, they aren’t quite ripe and won’t be very sweet.
These energy bites are a favorite apricot recipe.Easy No-Bake Apricot BallsThese healthy holiday cookies require only 10 minutes and 5 simple ingredients.
And they store well so they're a great option to make ahead!Get the recipeAvocadoAn avocado is a fruit and it’s SO good for babies and toddlers due to the healthy fats it contains.
You can serve it diced, sliced, or mashed on it’s own as a puree or spread onto toast.Or, try adding a few tablespoons to a smoothie to add creaminess.If you have some leftover avocado, try sticking it into a freezer bag in the freezer and using it for a smoothie later on!My Avocado Puree is such aneasy baby food recipethat requires hardly any time or effort—and it’s super versatile if you want to combine it with another puree too.Easy Avocado PureeThis easy baby food is rich in healthy fats, super smooth, and has a mellow flavor.
This is a great puree to make when you're eating something like tacos so you can have some, too!Get the recipeBananaFresh bananas are an easy snack that can be taken on the go or eaten at home.
Smaller bananas will have less likelihood of winding up half-eaten.And it’s fun to try the mini varieties which have a slightly different flavor and can mix up things a bit from week to week.
Also try:Banana Puree Baby FoodUse a ripe banana with at least some brown spots for the best flavor in this puree.Get the recipeBanana Oatmeal Pancakes (with Extra Protein)Very ripe (with brown spots) bananas will give these pancakes the best flavor.
Dice them up or serve whole, according to how the kids prefer to eat them.Get the recipeLower Sugar Banana Bread (SO Good!
Be sure to use super ripe bananas—the more black and brown spots, the better the flavor and sweetness will be!—for the best results here.Adapted from The Salty MarshmallowGet the recipeBanana Bread Oatmeal (to Share with the Kids)When you use a really ripe (or over ripe) banana in this recipe, it tastes so much like banana bread—but is much faster!
See the options for which toppings make this even more delish.Get the recipeQuick Caramelized BananasYou can easily double this recipe to feed more!Get the recipeBanana Oatmeal Breakfast CookiesYou can use peanut butter, almond butter, orSunbutterin this recipe.
Choose creamy unsweetened if possible.Get the recipeBest Banana Milk (So Easy!
Use a very ripe banana with a lot of brown spots in this recipe for the best flavor.Get the recipeSugar-Free Banana MuffinsBe sure to use very ripe bananas (with lots of brown spots!)
for the best flavor and natural sweetness.
I updated this recipe December 2020 to ensure the most reliable results.
The original version of this recipe is the “Egg-free” option in the Notes if you loved that.
In the main recipe, I reduced the oil, added an egg, increased the baking soda a smidge, and reduced the baking time.
They’re great!
Get the recipeBlueberriesFresh blueberries are a perfect kid snack.
For younger toddlers and babies eating solids, I recommend slicing them in half to ensure that they are easy to chew.
You can also try freeze-dried blueberries or frozen blueberries, which both have great nutrients.And here are some ways to use blueberries in recipes for kids.2-Minute Blueberry PureeYou can make this and serve it throughout the week, or stash some in the freezer for future use.
Feel free to double this to make a larger batch.Get the recipeSimple Blueberry Banana SmoothieFrozen banana will create a slightly thicker smoothie, so if you plan to serve this through a straw, I recommend doing either frozen blueberries OR bananas, but not both.
You can do all frozen fruit if you plan to serve it through a pouch or in an open cup—or if your child is used to drinking thick smoothies!Get the recipeFavorite Blueberry Mini MuffinsFluffy and perfectly moist, these little muffins have protein and calcium—plus bursts of delicious blueberries.
Like Little Bites, but with more nutrients and for less $$.)
See Notes for allergy variations.Get the recipeBlueberry Banana Muffins with OatsLike a cross between a fluffy blueberry muffin and baked oatmeal, these muffins are moist and packed with yummy nutrition.Get the recipeFavorite Blueberry Banana BreadThis bread is incredibly moist from the bananas and berries, so it takes a little while to bake through.
I add foil in Step 4 to prevent it from becoming too brown.Get the recipeBlueberry Chia Seed JamYou can make this with fresh or frozen blueberries.
Use the yogurt option to turn it into a quick and easy chia seed pudding.Get the recipeBlueberry Popsicles (with Yogurt and Spinach)If you have a high powered blender you can add up to a cup of spinach.
If you’re relying on a food processor you may want to reduce it to ½ cup.
Start with the lower amount and add more as you like.Get the recipeEasy Oatmeal Bars (with Blueberry and Carrot)These oatmeal bars taste like an oatmeal cookie and are great for breakfast or snack.
You can make them ahead, too!
You can add the egg or leave it out.
Without egg, these are a crisp cookie bar texture.
With it, they're a little cakier.
Get the recipeCantaloupeFresh cantaloupe is so good during the summer with it’s musty, mellow sweetness.
Look for one that gives slightly to the touch at the base and that smells like a cantaloupe for the best chances of bringing home one that tastes good.
Serve it diced or sliced.CherriesFresh cherries, while likely to be somewhat messy (get that bib out!
 are rich in antioxidants and have a deeply intense flavor—they definitely belong on my list of fruits!
Cut them in half and pop out the seed or use a cherry pitter.
Also try:Easy Cherry Smoothie (to Share with the Kids!
Try this naturally sweet smoothie filled with cherries, banana, and creamy yogurt.
Add the nut butter if desired for extra protein and flavor.Get the recipeFavorite Yogurt MuffinsThis is an epic of a basic muffin recipe that you can then add flavor to in all sorts of ways—from fruit to veggies to chocolate chips.
The batter is packed with protein too, so the muffins are great for breakfast or snack.
The allergy-friendly substitutions are listed in the Notes section at the bottom.
Get the recipeCitrusCitrus is great for helping to boost immunity with Vitamin C and to add water to kid’s diets with their high water content.
Look for oranges, blood oranges, grapefruit, clementines, mandarins and more to keep things interesting for your kids.
Also try:Orange-Honey Fruit SnacksThese take at least an hour or two to set in the fridge, so plan to make them a little in advance of when you want to serve them.Get the recipeCreamsicle Popsicles (3-Ingredients!
Make these freezer pops for a sweet snack or dessert.
They’re loaded with probiotics and Vitamin C and taste super fresh.Get the recipeFavorite Carrot Smoothie for KidsThe key to this smoothie is blending it super smooth, so don’t be scared to let the blender run for 30-60 seconds!Get the recipeFavorite Mango Smoothie RecipeThis fresh Mango Smoothie is thin enough to drink through a straw and thick enough to eat with a spoon.
And of course, it's super creamy!Get the recipeCranberriesFresh cranberries are too tart to eat straight up, but we love using them in bread!
And you can also stir cranberry sauce into plain yogurt for a fall treat.
Here are a few favorite cranberry recipes.Fresh Cranberry Orange BreadThis quick bread works really well to bake ahead and store in the fridge or freezer until ready to serve it.
We love it topped with cream cheese, but butter and honey also work.Get the recipeFavorite Cranberry Orange MuffinsCombine a handful of simple ingredients into fresh Cranberry Orange Muffins to share with the kids come breakfast or snack time … or to serve alongside your favorite chili, soup, or holiday recipe.
These mini muffins work best with fresh cranberries.
Get the recipeEasy Cranberry Orange SauceYes, this is delicious on turkey, but it also makes a great jam or addition to a bowl of plain yogurt with honey!Get the recipeFavorite Cranberry Apple PieWith sweet-tart flavors and an easy method, this pie is perfect for the winter holidays!
Use fresh or frozen cranberries in this recipe for the best results.
Discard any that are blemished or shriveled.Get the recipeFigsFresh figs are one of my favorite things in life and if you’re lucky enough to live in a place where you have access to them, buy them up!
