In August 2020,Forbesreportedthat Bezos’s net worth was greater than $200 billion—a barrier that no one before him had ever crossed.
Bill Gates, the world’s second-richest man, has a net worth that is tens of billions of dollars behind Bezos’s, for comparison’s sake.)
Much of that fortune comes from Amazon, the digital marketplace juggernaut that sells just about everything that he founded in 1994 in Bellevue, Washington.
In a year where Amazon was widely criticized for not doing enough to ensure worker safety during a pandemic, Bezos’s wealth only grew.
Just a month before hitting the $200-billion mark,Bloombergreportedthat he added $13 billion to his fortune in a single day.The same year Bezos became the first person worth more than $200 billion, he was also revealed to have been an art collector with at least two key works in his holdings already.
In November 2019, at a Christie’s auction, an Ed Ruscha painting titledHurting the Word Radio #2(1964), featuring the word “RADIO” being squeezed by two clamps, sold for $52.5 million to an anonymous phone bidder, setting a record for the artist.
The buyer, it turned out, was none other than Bezos himself, according to theBaer Faxtnewsletter, which also reported that the billionaire had made another significant purchase: Kerry James Marshall’sVignette 19(2014), which was bought at a Sotheby’s auction for $18.5 million, making it the second-most expensive work by the artist ever sold.
While it is still not widely known how and when Bezos began buying art, some have claimed that his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez spurred his collecting bug.In February 2021, Bezos announced that he would step down from his role as CEO of Amazon during the summer.
He is expected to transition into the role of executive chairman.
Later that year, he gave $200 million to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.
In 2022, he gave $10 million to the Seattle’s Museum of History & Industry, which named its Center for Innovation after Bezos.Related StoriesARTnewsCollector Guy Ullens Files Suit Against Son After Fatal Shooting of Wife, Myriam UllensARTnewsSeattle Art Museum Gets Major 48-Work Gift of Alexander Calder Works and $10 M.

At first glance, besides sharing a passing resemblance, perhaps not much.
But when you think about how artists and entrepreneurs develop and bringideasto fruition, there are many similarities, especially when you look at the journey getting there.Over the past 20 years, I've had the fortune of designing, developing and launching a host of new products.
Yes, some have failed.
But others have turned into successful businesses.
So how did each idea come about?
By learning from the masters of art.wikipaintings.org"Art demands constant observation."
 Vincent van GoghArtists engage with the world in a different way than most people.
They observe everything all the time -- shapes, lines, colors, connections, layers and textures.
They see both what is there as well as the empty spaces where nothing exists.
They expose themselves to new places and new experiences.Observation also needs to be a continuous activity for entrepreneurs.
You need to look for patterns, trends and connections.
You need to observe below the surface and beyond the headlines to see the essence of what is happening in the world.Related:Richard Branson on the Best Places to Find InspirationAs aserial entrepreneur, I've found that listening tocustomers,employees, partners, thought leaders and reading industry news, technology trends,Twitterfeeds,LinkedInheadlines, and blogs are essential in identifying newtrends.
I've also learned that new environments are a wonderful place for entrepreneurs to observe the world.
Thinking about new business opportunities over the years, I've made a conscious effort to meet new people, expose myself to different industries and visit other countries, even if for no other purpose than to observe and learn.wikipaintings.org"Don't wait for inspiration.
It comes while one is working."
 Henri MatisseFrom this constant observation will comeinspiration.
For most entrepreneurs, the world is full of ideas and opportunities.
These ideas will often appear out of the blue -- talking to a customer, in the shower, driving to work or lying in bed at night.
The important thing is to capture the idea.Over the years, I've found that this doesn't happen naturally.
It requires deliberate practice.
You have to resist evaluating each new idea right away.
Instead, just jot it down.
Sometimes I send myself an email or leave myself a voicemail.
This is important because while some ideas will immediately capture your attention, others might need some time to bake.
I also carry a journal of ideas, like an artist carries a sketchbook, and then periodically review my old ideas.
Approaching them at a different time and from a different perspective can provide new light.Related:3 Ways to Break Out of Your Comfort Zonewikipaintings.org"A man paints with his brains and not with his hands."
 MichelangeloThe real work begins once an idea is deemed worth pursuing.
For a painter, the first step is a study -- a working sketch or painting, often at a smaller scale.
This helps an artist compose the piece and identify challenges.
Sometimes the result is a minor adjustment to the original idea and other times a more radical re-envisioning.
The artist may also decide not to pursue the idea after this process.Successful entrepreneurs will do the same.
You will initially flesh out your idea, putting some shape to it.
You will start to understand the scope of the idea.wikipaintings.org"Painting is easy when you don't know how, but very difficult when you do."
 Edgar DegasA great painting requires a skilled, hard-working and patient artist.
A great business requires a skilled, hard-working, and patient entrepreneur.
Neither requires a great idea -- they just need an idea that inspires.
From here, passion will create the focus and drive required to put in the long hours and overcome the inevitable obstacles that will arise.In the end, some will starve, some will make a modest living and some will thrive.
Some, like Claude Monet and Jack Dorsey, will create works that are initially misunderstood, but ultimately revered.
Others, like Norman Rockwell and Mark Zuckerberg, will find enormous popularity.
And a very few, like Leonardo da Vinci and Steve Jobs, will create masterpieces of lasting beauty.Related:How One Entrepreneur Overcame Unthinkable TragedyDuane EdwardsCo-founder and Senior Vice President, GlobysDuane Edwards is co-founder ofGlobys, a big data analytics company based in Seattle, Wash., specializing in contextual marketing for mobile operators.Related TopicsArtistsBusiness IdeasInspirationIdeasStarting a BusinessInspiringEditor's PickThe Co-Founder of a Fashion Retailer With a Nearly 100% Retention RateReveals the Secret to Happy EmployeesEverything You Need to Know AboutFiling Your Taxes in 2023These 6 Leadership Skills Are Undervalued— But They Shouldn't Be, According to EmployeesWant to Become a Franchisee?Run Through This Checklist First.You Know Your Love Language, ButWhat About Your Money Language?A U.S. Company With Thousands of Employees Just Adopted a 4-Day Workweek —Here's the Innovative Blueprint Up for GrabsMost PopularSee allBusiness News'You Found A Time Machine': Woman Finds Her JCPenney Purse From 1994 and Unlocks an Accidental Time CapsuleThe contents went untouched for almost 30 years.ByEmily RellaBusiness NewsWalmart Pulls Crude T-Shirt From Its Stores.

Critics have chided Bezos for not signing theGiving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.Video Ad FeedbackExclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now01:50- Source:CNNIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”Asked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”Bezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.The 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and apossible economic recessionto Sánchez’s plan tovisit outer spacewith an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.Dolly PartonThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a$100 million grant to Partonas part of her Courage and Civility Award.
It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate andCNN contributor Van Jones.Getty ImagesDolly Parton receives $100 million Courage and Civility Award from Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right?
She is just beaming with light.
And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds.
And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”The throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.Unity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.How to give it awayBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune.
Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.Despite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to theBloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.Bezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs.
Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.Jose Andres, Jeff Bezos, Van Jones.Blue OriginBezos donates $100 million each to CNN contributor Van Jones and chef Jose AndresThough Bezos is now Amazon’s(AMZN)executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company.
Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s(AMZN)footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom.
Amazon’s(AMZN)reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.Bezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return.
It’s not easy.
Building Amazon was not easy.
It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added.
So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”Bezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recentlygave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizationsin the span of less than a year.The economic downturnWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.Last month, Bezostweeteda warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”Ringo H.W.
Chiu/AP/Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images'Batten down the hatches': Bezos and fellow billionaires are issuing recession warningsThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said.
Keep some dry powder on hand….
Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems.
You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”Many may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.Bezos and Sánchez’s partnershipSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said.
Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”Sánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot.
She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.Bezos has creditedhis own journey to spacefor helping to inspire his push to fight climate change.
Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.Sánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023.
And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”Washington’s NFL teamGetty ImagesJay-Z and Jeff Bezos are interested in buying the Washington Commanders togetherBezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume.
CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potentialjoint bid on the Washington Commanders.It is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.But during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.Sánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football.
I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”Bezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”– CNN’s Chloe Melas contributed to this reportRelatedAd FeedbackMore from CNN BusinessLucy Nicholson/ReutersCommercial real estate is in trouble.

5 on Forbes' Richest People on the Planet listwith a staggering net worth of $45.2 billion.But what does this billionaire entrepreneur do when he's not working?
What are his hobbies, passions and interests outside of dominating the American online retail market?
And what can we learn from this hyper-successful man?1.
He sleeps... a lot.In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Bezos talked about the importance of sleep.
This is in sharp contrast tothe majority of CEOs who only sleep around four hours a night.
Not Bezos.He makes sure to get a solid eighthours of shut-eye every night.
He believes sleep is the best counter to stress and overworking.
There are even stories of him bringing a sleeping bag into the office, to pound out quick naps during those extra-difficult days.And he doesn't use an alarm clock, citing the advantages of waking up naturally.Quite a few sleep scientists agree with his way of thinking.Related:Entrepreneurs Rank High Among the 50 Wealthiest People in the World2.
He has an amazing hobby.Bezos' hobby is so elite, expensive and niche that it makes sense only he's known for it.
When given the opportunity, he spends timecombing the oceans for discarded NASA rocket ships.Because most of the rocket ship detaches from space shuttles mid-flight, there's no safe place to discard the rocket boosters, except over the ocean.
Bezos has turned this into his hobby, working with teams in submarines (sometimes bringing along his family) to retrieve these historic relics.
He once spent three weeks on a single underwater rocket hunt.If you want to see what that looks like,here's a video.3.
He creates side projects for himself.Because running Amazon isn't demanding enough on its own, Bezos has taken up a few side gigs.
For instance, he boughtThe Washington Post,one of America's most prestigious newspapers.
He hasn't changed much about it, except its online loading times.And before Elon Musk made it cutting edge,Bezos started a space company back in 2000 called Blue Origin LLC.
His goal?
Give everyone the opportunity to travel into outer space.He's also trying tostreamline Amazon further by delivering packages via drones.
That is, if the government will allow it.Related:Another Successful Rocket Launch and Land for Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin4.
He spends his mornings doing whatever he wants.Unlike Steve Jobs, who would eat the same thing for breakfast everydayin order to "pare down decisions,"Bezos has made an effort to keep it fresh.
There is one story of Bezosordering Mediterranean octopus with bacon and garlic yogurtfor breakfast in order to better understand another CEO, who he eventually bought out.Regimented morning routines aren't for everyone, and Bezos is a strong supporter of letting the morning come naturally.
That'swhy he doesn't schedule early-morning meetingsand prefers to spend time with his loved ones.Related:6 Unlikely Characteristics Common Among Billionaires5.
He's a family man.Ironically, Bezos's biological fatherdidn't even know that he was aliveuntil just recently.
Fortunately, Bezos himself is a much better father.
He prioritizes family, and (like Elon Musk), he's got a big one, so he sort of has to.As you've read, he always makes time for family during breakfast, takes his wife and four adopted kids on submarine excursions and does his best to be involved, even with his intense and insane schedule.It's safe to say that Bezos does pretty much everything that he wants to.
But if there's one thing we can learn from his personal life, it's that even the world's most successful people are still only human.
During a typical day, Bezos puts his family and healthliterallyahead of his business.

Good intentions don't work, mechanisms do'" is a mantra from Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos which serves as a road map for how the e-commerce giant intends to meet that goal.Amazon's $2 billion Climate Pledge Fund seeks out startups that are building solutions to address the company's problems.In this articleAMZNFollow your favorite stocksCREATE FREE ACCOUNTAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos announces the co-founding of The Climate Pledge at the National Press Club on September 19, 2019, in Washington.Paul Morigi | Getty Images | AmazonEven while Jeff Bezos has stepped away from day-to-day operations at Amazon, his lessons still echo in the halls there.
One of those business mantras is a guidepost for Amazon's effort to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.
Jeff Bezos has — what's become across Amazon and more broadly quoted — an expression that I think is really quite beautiful,"said Amazon's Daniel Grossduring an interview with CNBC correspondent Diana Olick on Thursday during CNBC's ESG Impact event.
Good intentions don't work, mechanisms do.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos (via Daniel Gross)That quote is: "'Good intentions don't work, mechanisms do,'" said Gross, a director at the company's climate investing arm, theClimate Pledge Fund at Amazon.
By making the climate pledge, by putting 'Climate Pledge' up in major lights across Seattle, by setting aside $2 billion for a climate pledge fund — those are the kinds of mechanisms that will keep us on track for delivering on that pledge," Gross said.In 2019, Amazon made its own voluntary commitment to decarbonize by 2040, a decade ahead of the Paris climate accord deadline.
The e-commerce giant also invited other companies to pledge their own climate goals and to become a member in the organization, which Amazon launched withChristiana FigueresandTom Rivett-Carnac, the architects of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement.In 2020, Amazon announced it had bought the naming rights to a mid-sized arena in Seattle and renamed it Climate Pledge Arena.
This was meant to be "a regular reminder of the urgent need for climate action," Bezos wrote on his personal Instagram account at the time.Climate Pledge Arena renderingSource: Amazon"We went out, we bought the naming rights to the major hockey stadium and concert arena in Seattle.
And we didn't name it the Amazon Arena.
We called it the Climate Pledge Arena.
You drive in downtown Seattle, and you see Climate Pledge in enormous letters," Gross said.
In some ways, it's like we created a mechanism where it would be just so impossible to put the toothpaste back in the tube without humiliating ourselves that we are sticking to that pledge," Gross said.Another mechanism Amazon has set up is the Climate Pledge Fund, which is directing $2 billionto invest into climate startupsthat are working to solving problems Amazon itself is facing.
We shouldn't just sit idly by on the sidelines, waiting for other people to develop the technologies and the business models that can help decarbonize our operations, right?
Otherwise, we might be waiting until 2040 before someone has a hydrogen-powered airplane or something like that, that works for our operations," Gross told CNBC.
Instead, what we should be doing is putting money at work, and more significantly, doing everything that we possibly can to invest in companies with our time, with our energy, with our commitments to purchase from them," said Gross.Investments have to meet two conditions, 1/ to be viable according to conventional venture capital standards, and 2/ to work to solve a problem for Amazon.
We may see a fantastic company that's solving a carbon problem.
But if it's not an Amazon carbon problem, there's nothing that we can really do to help that company.
And so we limit ourselves to those companies where there's a technology we can adopt," Gross told CNBC.The startup also has to seem to have a pathway to profitability.
We are not a philanthropic organization.
We're absolutely in it for profit," Gross said.
That said, if it looks like Amazon's purchasing power will enable the startup to achieve profitability, that's also an option.One of the best-known examples is its partnership with the electric automakerRivian, in which Amazon owns a stake.
We made a purchase commitment for 100,000 electric delivery vans, and not surprisingly, we chose to invest in the company pre-IPO," Gross said.watch nowVIDEO13:2013:20Inside Rivian's deal with AmazonTechMore In Sustainable ReturnsThe mortgage that will pay to make your home more climate friendlyCheryl Winokur MunkThese organizations are trying to tackle plastic pollution and poverty at the same timeKatie Brighamwatch nowwatch nowVIDEO15:28These organizations are selling plastic offsets to help build recycling infrastructureKatie BrighamRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesSelect ShoppingClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

But That’s Not Why He’s Jacked.
Here’s How He Does ItLifestyleJeff Bezos Is Rich.
Here’s How He Does ItYou can’t get this body in two days.BySydney Bueckert, NASM CPT, CES, FNS, GPTFebruary 22, 2023At 58 years old, Jeff Bezos is as yoked as his bank account, which stands at $142 billion.Over the past few years, the founder and former CEO of Amazon evolved from meek geek to movie star chic.
Now in the best shape of his life, his transformation has delighted the Internet, first agog when heunleashed these pythons of bicepsin 2017 atbillionaire sleepaway camp in Sun Valley, Idaho.
While aplethora of apt memesflowed, Bezos doubled down,growing leaner and more swolewith each subsequent year.Former and current Jeff Bezos is literally the 'you vs. the guy she told you not to worry about' meme.pic.twitter.com/NNA2LlFxy8— Yoni (@OriginalYoni)July 14, 2017His newfound interest in achieving peak health isn’t surprising.
Those in the triple comma club are obsessed with longevity and anti-aging—after all, the ideal way to enjoy enormous bank accounts is to live longer.
Recently,Bezos has invested in several “rejuvenation” clinics, aimed at staving off death.
While theentrepreneur-cum-occasional-astronauthas endless capital to enlist celebrity personal trainers, nutritionists, and chefs, you don’t achieve a body like his by sitting around, particularly after 40.It takes dedication and willpower to go fromhoovering up whole cans of Pillsbury biscuits soaked in butterto hammering the gym multiple times a week.Here, everything we know about how Bezos exercises, eats, sleeps, approaches mental health, longevity, and anti-aging.He Exercises More Frequently Than a Hamster on a WheelSnaps of Bezos and his girlfriend,Lauren Sanchez, in St. Barts in 2021 show off his shirtless build, revealing loaded arms, a chiseled six-pack, and enviable, massive pecs.View this post on InstagramA post shared by Lauren Sanchez (@laurenwsanchez)The architect behind the guns?
Celebrity trainer,Wes Okerson.
Okerson’s roster boasts A-lister’s Tom Cruise and Gerard Butler, among others.Known for his diverse approach to training, Okerson toldThe Weekhe believes mixing up your training regimen is key.
He has clients like Bezos mix it up with outdoor sports with paddle boarding and rowing, along with regular strength sessions.Before Bezos could launch into the full-scale strength training regimen, Okerson would have had him nail down his bodyweight squat, lunge, and pushup form.
I reduce things to a simple level until they get those moves right,” Okerson toldThe Week.Once Bezos perfected his technique, Okerson added in weights and encourages him to progressively lift heavier over time.
A routine combining heavy resistance and metabolic stress maximizes hypertrophy (or muscle size) (1)—the exact method Okerson harnessed to build Bezos’ physique.View this post on InstagramA post shared by Wesley (@wesokerson)The secret behind Bezos’ stacked upper body: pull-ups.
The pulling action on a bar is the very best thing you can do for your abs and core,” Okerson says.
A practice we can tell Bezos employs proved via his defined abs.FitnessExactly How to Use Strength and Hypertrophy Training for Targeted GainsIf You’re a Human, You Need a Functional Fitness RoutineHe Has a Passion for Extreme AdventuresWhen he isn’t tied up at work, Bezos can be found on a wild-goose chase of unusual adventures.
Hetraveled to the bottom of the ocean to retrieve pieces of Apollo 13,climbed an Amazon wind turbine,went dog sledding,andbeen to space on Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket.Sometimes, his adventures take days—like his 50-mile horseback ride through West Texas.
Three days, super fun, my butt hurt,” Bezos recounted to his brother, Mark Bezos, at the 2017Summit Series.Mark also shared photos of Bezos rappelling hundreds of feet down into a cave of stalagmites.
That was a great trip,” Bezos said.
You don’t have to worry about checking your phone there.
No radio signals down there.”View this post on InstagramA post shared by Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos)He also enjoys more conventional activities, likekayaking, and tennis.
The billionaire was spotted competing in a celebrity tennis match against Bill Gates in 2001.Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos playing tennis (2001):pic.twitter.com/ChJyJtkcAm— Jon Erlichman (@JonErlichman)April 29, 2021He Eats a Lot of ProteinAfter three months of watching Bezos go to town on Pillsbury, his former wife,Mackenzie Scott, asked the Blue Origin founder if he knew what was in those biscuits.
I had never read a nutrition label in my life; I ate what tasted good to me,” Bezos admitted at the2017 Summit Series.He still indulges in less-than-healthy grub, from time to time.
He’s posted apicture of his Cheeto-dusted fingers,loves to cook risotto, andenjoyed a McDonald’s hamburger in September 2022.“My first job.
Still the same great burger,” he wrote.Even Bezos has his limits.
Apparently, he draws the line at fine art—failing to act on a petition started in 2021 for Bezos to buy and eat the Mona Lisa—to the disappointment of fans and haters alike.The billionaire hasn’t shared a breakdown of his daily diet, but his ripped physique suggests fast food isn’t the norm.He’s spotted with girlfriend Lauren Sanchez at Nobu—a star-studded sushi spot in Malibu, CA—nearly three times a week, where he’s packing down plates of fish.A high fish intake jives with the lean protein, and healthy fat intake necessary to build the muscle we see on Bezos today.
Fish like tuna, salmon, and trout are high in protein and omega-3 fatty acids.One study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that having higher levels of certain omega-3 fatty acids in the blood—as a result of regularly including fatty fish in the diet—can boost life expectancy by almost five years (2).Healthy eatingMacronutrients vs. Micronutrients: What’s the Difference?These Anti-Aging Foods Can Add Years to Your LifeHe’s Invested in Anti-AgingWhile fellow billionaire, Elon Musk,isn’t keen on pushing the limits of the human lifespan, Bezos has poured $3 billion in start capital into his biotechnology venture,Altos Labs, which launched January 2022.Altos Labs is dedicated to harnessing cellular reprogramming, a way to rejuvenate cells in the lab that some scientists think could revitalize entire animal bodies and ultimately prolong human life.The science is promising but new.
It’s far away from translation into human therapy,” researcher Alejandro Ocampo toldTechnology Review.In hisfinal letter to Amazon shareholders, Bezos included a quote from biologist Richard Dawkins, “Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at…If living things don’t actively work to prevent it, they would eventually merge with their surroundings and cease to exist as autonomous beings.
That is what happens when they die.”LongevityThis Diabetes Drug Might Help Us All Live LongerScientists Are Working on Drugs that Kill “Zombie Cells” to Help You Live to 200He Gets a Full Eight Hours of Sleep“I get eight hours of sleep unless I’m traveling in different time zones,” Bezostold theEconomic Clubin 2018.
Bezos believes that getting eight hours of sleep is the key to boosting productivity and making high-quality decisions.
Based on his business track record, it works.Sleep requirements can vary among people, experts recommend seven to nine hours of sleep for optimal health.
Research suggests that after a good night’s sleep you may feel less anxious and more confident (3).Bezos goes to bed early, because he likes to wake up naturally without an alarm clock, and typically rises around 6:30 a.m. A recent study from Australia found that the “harsh tones” of an alarm clock can exacerbate sleep inertia, or grogginess (4).SleepNot Getting Enough Sleep Could Have This Terrible Side EffectThese Science-Backed Strategies Will Help You Fall Asleep FastHe Makes Time to Do Nothing“I like to putter in the mornings,” Bezostold Thrive Global in 2016.
He likes to read the newspaper, have coffee, enjoy breakfast with his kids, and wash the dishes before he starts his work day at 10 a.m.Puttering time is vital to Bezos because it helps him establish a healthy balance between work and rest.
I prefer the word “harmony” to the word “balance” because balance tends to imply a strict tradeoff,” said Bezos.
If I’m happy at work, I’m better at home…If I’m happy at home, I come to work more energized.”He might be onto something.
According to one study, taking the time to let your mind wander is directly related to a boost in creativity (5).There’s Speculation He’s on TRTClearly Bezos has put significant work into building the body he has today.
The guy looks great.
No amount of testosterone can pack on that kind of muscle without a solid training regimen to back it up.However, given his age, and previous body composition, many doubt Bezos’ ability to achieve said pump without a little help.Testosterone lowers body fat and is the most essential anabolic (muscle-building) hormone.
Men typically experience a drop in 1% of testosterone per year after age 30 (6).We’re not speculating about Bezos’ T levels, but we can say that men approaching the age of 60 definitelyexperience a drop in natural testosterone levels, which is tied to the ability to maintain and build muscle.Still, given his recent interest in bettering healthspans and lifespans,testosterone replacement therapy(TRT) would make sense.
Maintaining optimal T levels can prevent cardiovascular disease and improve heart health (7).
Men on TRT can experience improved energy, mood, libido, and better mental acuity and focus (8).TestosteroneTRT Before and After: These Jaw-Dropping TRT Transformations Prove Your Life Can Change10 Benefits of Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT)How Will TRT Transform You?Checking your T levels is easy with Hone’s at-home assessment.

Daring To Dream: Jeff Bezos Is Standing Outside A Guitar Center Gazing Longingly At A $200 Billion Guitar - ClickHolePress "Enter" to skip to contentSearchSearch ClickHoleopen menuBackLatestNewsPop CultureLifestyleQuizzesClickVenturesVideoKidHoleEmail ClubStoreNewsDaring To Dream: Jeff Bezos Is Standing Outside A Guitar Center Gazing Longingly At A $200 Billion GuitarJuly 12, 2018Here’s a story about someone who’s not afraid to dream big: Jeff Bezos is standing outside a Guitar Center staring longingly at a $200 billion guitar he wishes he could afford.Keep your eye on the prize, Jeff.
Maybe one day!The guitar first caught Bezos’ eye when he was walking by Guitar Center last week, and he’s been by every day since just to check out the same limited-edition Fender Stratocaster with sea-foam green paneling that retails for just shy of $200 billion.
Even though the Amazon CEO only has $134 billion in his savings right now, he can’t stop daydreaming about how badass he’d look rocking out to some classic Zeppelin in the 20-car garage of his mansion with that beautiful ax slung around his neck.
Now, as Jeff Bezos gazes in wonder at the shiny guitar in the window display, he’s racking his brain to see if there’s anything in his stock portfolio he could sell off to scrape together those last $66 billion he needs to afford the guitar.Wistfully thinking about how romantic his wife, MacKenzie, would think it was if he played her a slow song like Clapton’s “Wonderful Tonight” while sailing on one of their mega-yachts, Bezos is now silently vowing to do whatever it takes—whether setting up new offshore tax shelters, slashing employee benefits, or taking a summer job at a hedge fund—to raise the money needed to bring the $200 billion Strat within his reach.
And he’s keenly aware that some other billionaire could swoop in and snatch up the guitar at any moment, so he knows he needs to act fast and save every last penny he earns from here on out to make his dream of owning the gorgeous single-coil Fender a reality.What a beautiful moment!
We know Bezos will be pulling out all the stops and working extra hard at his job at Amazon to bring that guitar home.
Good luck, sir!AmazonGuitarjeff bezosLoveMoneyWowMore posts inNews »A Failure Of The System On Every Level: Millions Of Americans Live In Poverty, And Millions More Have Tons Of Money But Also Seem Sad And Negative All The TimeA Failure Of The System On Every Level: Millions Of Americans Live In Poverty, And Millions More Have Tons Of Money But Also Seem Sad And Negative All The TimeA Wonderful Update: The American Society For Microbiology Just Announced That All Those Tiny Little Guys Are Doing Just FineA Wonderful Update: The American Society For Microbiology Just Announced That All Those Tiny Little Guys Are Doing Just FineHeartwarming: These Kayakers Saved A Dolphin That Had Gotten Its G-String Caught On Some Fishing LineHeartwarming: These Kayakers Saved A Dolphin That Had Gotten Its G-String Caught On Some Fishing LineDo They Think We’re Stupid?

Here are 10 things you may not know about the billionaire and his company:STORY: Does CBS and Amazon’s ‘Under the Dome’ Deal Hurt Cable?1.Amazon’s early name was “Relentless.com.”Try typing “Relentless.com” and see where it takes you.2.
Amazon spends $1.6 million a year on personal security for Bezos and his family.Yet his wife, MacKenzie, a respected novelist, still drives him to work in their Honda after dropping their four kids off at school.3.
Stone foundBezos’ long-lost biological father, who was a high-wire unicyclist who went to Hollywood to audition forThe Ed Sullivan Show.Bezos never knew his biological dad,John Jorgensen, a kindly man who didn’t care how much money he made in pursuit of his unicycle dream.
Bezos’ mom kicked the deadbeat dad out of their lives.
Stone told Jorgensen his son was Jeff Bezos, whom he’d never heard of.
He was stunned his son was worth $25 billion and is the 12th-richest American.
After flopping in Hollywood and fatherhood, Bezos’ dad took a $1.25 an hour job.4.Amazon’s board may have tried to dump Bezos after he becameTimeMagazine’s Person of the Year in 1999.Though three board members deny it, other execs called Bezos “impetuous and controlling” and were terrified by his “reckless binge” of spending and the chaos in Amazon warehouses stuffed with $39 million in unsold toys and staffed by temps — some of whom were high on crack or alcohol.
One worker [got] fired for intoxication and then wet himself while he tried to protest.” If Amazon’s board really maneuvered to dump him asSteve Jobswas dumped from Apple, Stone says, they couldn’t, because he controlled most Amazon stock.
And Amazon’s distribution centers became futuristically efficient.5.Bezos laughs “like a cross between a mating elephant seal and a power tool.”But don’t be fooled — it’s like Tom Cruise’s smile, a way to hypnotize you and deflect questions, not just to be nice.
Don’t] misunderstand it,” warns ex-Amazon execRick Dalzell.
It’s disarming and punishing.
He’s punishing you.” No one in Jeff Bezos’ family has a weird laugh — except his biological dad, who sounds exactly the same.6.
At age three, Bezos disassembled his crib with a screwdriver.He wanted to sleep on a bed.
As a Wall Street wunderkind, he kept a sleeping bag in his office.7.
Thanks to his tin ear, Bezos lost untold billions to Apple’s Steve Jobs.Jobs was a music lover (and datedJoan Baez).
Bezos, who let Jobs hire away his music editorKeith Moerer, has “a lack of interest in music of any kind.” As a teen, Bezos memorized the call letters of local radio stations so he could fake being hip to the music scene.
But he was so unhip he let Jobs seize the lead in creating the iPod.
We were freaking out over what the iPod had done to Amazon’s music business,” ex-Amazon execJohn Doerrtold Stone.
So Bezos invented the Kindle to prevent Apple (or others) from stealing the digital-book future.8.
Cowering under a shuddering table in 2001’s Seattle earthquake, Bezos almost got crushed by a 20-pound tungsten ball fromWhole Earth Catalogfounder Stewart Brand.Bezos had bankrolled Brand’s atomic 10,000-Year Clock of the Long Now Foundation.
The real 2001 earthquake was the Amazon-goes-broke-in-a-year prediction of Lehman Brothers analystRavi Suria, who tanked the stock and almost crushed Amazon.
Suria says Bezos tried to get him fired and ruined his life for years, and that Bezos is “deranged.”9.
Bezos had to be meaner than Steve Jobs.Stone says Bezos was more ruthless than Jobs, because the music industry was terrified of piracy, and so submitted to digitizing and cutting prices.
People seldom piratebooks, so Bezos had to play hardball to force booksellers to digitize books.
He declared up-to-$100 million price wars to crush, engulf and devour innovative upstart rivals.
Stone’s Amazon stories are good, grisly fun.10.
Bezos created a “brutal, combative” corporate culture.One Amazon exec could be such a mean screamer, she got banned from Warner Home Video, Stone’s sources say.
Laura [Porco]can be one of the kindest people, but when it comes to Amazon, she wants to drink blood,” said ex-AmazonianChristopher Smith.
Porco went on to launch Kindle and triple Amazon’s stock price.
Bezos had “ice water [in] his veins” no matter how scary things got and coolly fired or sidelined employees by the thousands, including those who were with him from the start and helped him succeed.
Careers and personal lives [were] left in tatters,” writes Stone.
One low-level employee fell to the floor wailing and sobbing after getting fired.
Bezos may have hired a secret “leadership coach” to keep him from eviscerating employees.
Bezos treated weak, inefficient rivals “the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly giraffe” — his publisher-relations program was dubbed “the Gazelle Project.” Amazon’sErick Gossquit, saying Amazon’s bloodthirsty, combative culture was against his Christian values, and he had post-traumatic stress for a year after leaving.
Yet many employees got rich and enjoyed the rush of changing the world fast, plua last year Amazon’s workforce more than doubled, to 88,400.

There are 2,754 billionaires in the world, more than ever before, the report finds, and their collective net worth is $9.2 trillion.
Time is at a premium for the world's wealthiest individuals," the report says.But when the billionaires of the world aren't focused on their business or philanthropic efforts, the next most common interest is sport, the report finds.
Aside from philanthropy and, as one would expect, a common interest in business affairs, the foremost passion or hobby among the global billionaire population involves sporting activities (44%)," the report says.The most popular sport among billionaires is golf, the report finds.
Sport has always been one of the most popular hobby categories for billionaires, offering them a temporary (and at times relaxing) distraction from daily pressures, whether as a passive observer of elite sporting contests or as an active participant in the favored pastimes of golf, skiing and tennis (the trinity of classic 'wealthy' sports)," the report says.Aviation is another popular interest, according to the report.And almost half of billionaires report being interested in collecting art, the report finds.
Luxury art collections have traditionally offered strong value as an investment asset — industry estimates of global auction sales suggest that art was one of the best-performing asset classes in 2017 — with demand underpinned by the robust development of prime real estate markets," the report says.While the most popular category of art is painting and drawing, contemporary art is also popular.
The expansion of the Asian billionaire class and the growth of tech-driven ultra wealth has produced a larger cohort of younger billionaires, which has contributed to increased demand for contemporary art in particular," the report says.When it comes to music, billionaires tend to appreciate classical the most, the report finds.
Among music genres, the billionaire population as a whole favors classical music, most likely reflecting a demographic with a high average age, rather than particular refinement or connoisseurship," the report says.
Half the billionaires in the U.S. and Europe, for example, are over 70, the report says, and the average age for billionaires globally is 64.5, a WealthX spokesperson tells CNBC Make It.In terms of the most popular instruments, "after the guitar and piano (the two favorites), only the violin and drums registered an incidence of greater than 1%," the report says.For the report, a billionaire's interest was tallied both if the individual has an interest in the activity for an investment perspective or to participate in, since billionaires often do both, a WealthX spokesperson tellsCNBC Make It.
WealthX calculated the billioniares' net worth for the 2017 calendar year.See also:5,000 people applied to LinkedIn listing to be personal assistant on Richard Branson's Necker IslandWhat Jeff Bezos learned about how to be successful working on his grandfather's ranch as a kidCollege decisions made luxe: For $57,000, you can travel to campuses on a private jetVIDEO5:4105:41Richard Branson: I've never been motivated by moneySquawk BoxLike this story?

Billionaire childhood homes: from Jeff Bezos' ranch to Warren Buffet's tiny bungalow | loveproperty.comNewsHomesInteriorsInvestingFeaturesSign InNewsHomesInteriorsInvestingFeaturesBillionaire childhood homes: from Jeff Bezos' ranch to Warren Buffet's tiny bungalowGallery View|Expand ViewWhere 10 of the world's richest people grew upLoren Elliott / AFP via Getty ; lev radin / ShutterstockWhile some of the planet's richest people were born into fabulous wealth and privilege, others had far more humble beginnings.
With this in mind, we reveal the properties where 10 big-name billionaires spent their formative years.
From Kim Kardashian's Beverly Hills manse and Elon Musk's Pretoria pad to Jeff Bezos' grandfather's ranch in Texas, click or scroll to look back at where it all began...Tyler Perry's New Orleans shotgun houseRealtor ; Featureflash Photo Agency / ShutterstockTyler Perry overcame a tough, troubled childhood to excel as an actor, director, producer and screenwriter.
Now worth a billion dollars, the multitalented creator of theMadeamovie franchise came into the world on 13 September 1969 and grew up in a compact two-bedroom, one-bathroom Victorian shotgun house in New Orleans' Faubourg Delassize neighbourhood.Tyler Perry's New Orleans shotgun houseTyler Perry / FacebookSubjected to an extremely difficult childhood and growing up in poverty, the Hollywood mogul would use his imagination to escape the trauma of his early life, providing the foundation for many of the characters that would go on to make him a billionaire.Tyler Perry's New Orleans shotgun houseRealtor.comThese days, the shotgun house is bright and airy, with towering ceilings and elegant fixtures – no doubt a sight different from the living spaces Tyler grew up in.
The home remained in the Perry family until 2013 when it was sold for just under $150,000 (£106k).Tyler Perry's New Orleans shotgun houseRealtor.comThe new owner went all out restoring and remodelling the property, adding an extra bedroom and bathroom at the back of the house, along with a swish new kitchen, but was careful to keep the original features.
These include the ornate fireplaces and original hardwood flooring, not to mention retaining the two front bedrooms.Tyler Perry's New Orleans shotgun houseRealtor.comThe house also has a nice-sized backyard.
The neighbourhood of Faubourg Delassize has undergone gentrification in recent years, and many of the crumbling shotgun houses it is celebrated for have been renovated.
Needless to say, home prices have risen accordingly, and the dinky property on Baronne Street sold in 2019 for $345,000 (£245k), though it was initially listed for $559,000 (£396k).Kim Kardashian's Beverly Hills manseGoogle Earth ; Asatur Yesayants / ShutterstockAs childhoods go, Kim Kardashian's was nothing short of idyllic.
Born on 21 October 1980, the reality star – who is worth a cool billion dollars –  was raised in a dreamy six-bedroom, eight-bathroom mansion on Tower Lane, an ultra-exclusive private cul-de-sac in the heart of Beverly Hills.Kim Kardashian's Beverly Hills manse@kimkardashian / InstagramPictured here (left) with older sister Kourtney, Kim's luxurious childhood home boasted everything from tennis courts to a duck-shaped pool and a matching Jacuzzi in the form of an egg.Kim Kardashian's Beverly Hills manseBerkshire Hathaway HomeServicesTogether with big sister, Kourtney and younger siblings Khloé and Rob, Kim was spoiled rotten by her parents Robert and Kris Kardashian, who lavished their kids with pretty much anything they wanted.
Sadly, Kim's world came crashing down and her charmed fairytale existence ended abruptly in 1989 when Kris had an affair with soccer player Todd Waterman, prompting Robert to file for divorce.Kim Kardashian's Beverly Hills manseBerkshire Hathaway HomeServicesKim moved away with her mother and siblings but visited on a regular basis until her dad put the 6,527-square-foot property on the market in 1994.
It ended up selling for $2.2 million (£1.6m).
These interior pics were taken that same year, after the manse was given a makeover that removed Kris'"ridiculous wallpaper and kitchen set”and other OTT 1980s touches.Kim Kardashian's Beverly Hills manse@kimkardashian / InstragramFast-forward to 5 November 2019 and Kim surprised 'momager' Kris on her 64th birthday with a trip down memory lane by hiring out the beloved house for an intimate lunch, even going as far as recreating the infamous wallpaper on the table settings and renting out every single car her parents owned.
Kris has described the home as “her heart” and misses living there to this day.Donald Trump's Queens cottageGoogle Maps ; Nuno21 / ShutterstockAmerica's only billionaire president, Donald Trump, whose fortune is currently estimated at $2.4 billion (£1.7bn), lived in this picture-perfect Mock Tudor cottage for the first four years of his life.
The house was built in 1940 by the future POTUS' real estate developer father Fred and is located in the upscale Jamaica Estates section of New York's Queens borough.Donald Trump's Queens cottageDonald J. Trump for President, Inc.Born on 14 June 1946, young Trump's formative years were spent in this characterful home.
Measuring 2,500 square feet, the cottage he first called home would've given Donald a comfortable start to life.Donald Trump's Queens cottageKyle Lyman, DDReps PhotographyThe brick, stucco and half-timbered house has a total of five bathrooms and four-and-a-half bathrooms, a capacious living and dining room, as well as a library.
The house was last sold in 2017 for the inflated price of $2.1 million (£1.5m), the then-owner clearly capitalising on Trump's fame, having bought the property a year earlier for $1.4 million (£1m).Donald Trump's Queens cottageKyle Lyman, DDReps PhotographyWhileTrump apparently thought about acquiring the house, it was supposedly snagged by a mystery Chinese investor.
The house was then listed on Airbnb several months after it sold in 2017, priced at $727 (£515) a night.
Yet according to theNew York Timesthere appeared to be few takers as the house seemed empty most of the time.Donald Trump's Queens cottageKyle Lyman, DDReps PhotographyDespite its connection to one of the mostinfamous family dynastiesin the world, the current owner is having a hard time offloading the property.
After attempting to sell it at auction last August, the owner started a GoFundMe to raise $3 million (£2.1m) from Trump fans to buy the house as a gift for the one-term POTUS, but to date has managed to raise just $7,038 (£5k).Richard Branson's Surrey farmhouseSotheby’s International Realty ; Prometheus72 / ShutterstockBorn on 18 July 1950 into a well-heeled family, Virgin boss Richard Branson was nonetheless avidly entrepreneurial from the get-go.
He came up with many of his early money-making schemes at his later childhood home, the characterful red-brick four-bedroom, four-bathroom Tanyards Farm, which nestles on 1.4 acres in the Surrey village of Shamley Green.Richard Branson's Surrey farmhouseCourtesy VirginThe British business magnate, who is now worth $5.1 billion (£3.6bn) and counts hisown private Necker Islandamongst his assets, moved into the Grade II-listed house in 1963 together with his parents, Eve and Ted, and siblings.Richard Branson's Surrey farmhouseSotheby's International RealtyAmong the schemes he concocted in the 17th-century property was a Christmas tree-growing business.
After rabbits devoured the seedlings and tanked the scheme, the ever-resourceful teenager shot the offending bunnies and sold the meat to a local butcher.Richard Branson's Surrey farmhouseSotheby's International RealtyThe Virgin founder went on to launch a budgie-breeding enterprise from the farmhouse, which also failed, and the family narrowly avoided losing the property in 1971.
According to theEvening Standard, it had to be remortgaged to settle an $85,000 (£60k) fine the young businessman incurred after he was caught selling export-only records, evading tax in the process.Richard Branson's Surrey farmhouseSotheby's International RealtyFortunately, Virgin signed Mike Oldfield not long after and the rookie entrepreneur made his first million pounds in 1973 off the back of the massive success of theTubular BellsLP,saving his parent's property, and then some.
Listed last November for $5.6 million (£4m), the property, which impresses with stunning original features, a bespoke kitchen and a conservatory is now on for $4.9 million (£3.5m).Warren Buffett's Omaha CraftsmanGoogle Maps ; Stephen Smith / SIPA USA / PA ImagesInvesting legend Warren Buffett was born on 30 August 1930 and spent the first few years of his life in this one-and-a-half storey Craftsman-style bungalow on Barker Avenue in Omaha, Nebraska, the city he has called home ever since.Warren Buffett's Omaha CraftsmanCourtesy Buffett familyHis parents, future Congressman Howard and Leila Buffett had purchased the home not long after their wedding in 1925.
Like many Midwestern homes of the era, the cute clapboard property was built using a Searshome kit.Warren Buffett's Omaha CraftsmaneBay / Realtor.comThe Buffett family soon moved on to a larger property, but the Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO has never been one for extravagance and excess, and despite being worth a whopping $108.1 billion (£76.6m), currently lives in a relatively modest home more or less a mile away.Warren Buffett's Omaha CraftsmaneBay / Realtor.comStill, the bijou Craftsman is as basic as they come, though it isn't without its charms.
Featuring just two bedrooms and one bathroom, the house has a 400-square-foot dormer room that could be converted into a master suite, as well as a kitchen, living and dining room and unfinished fruit cellar.Warren Buffett's Omaha CraftsmaneBay / Realtor.comThe house was put up for sale by its then-owner Jennifer Smedley in 2011 on eBay of all places with an asking price of $120,000 (£85k).
Billed as the perfect place for a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder to stay during the conglomerate's famed annual meeting in Omaha, it eventually sold for $150,000 (£106k), the price no doubt boosted by its connection to the city's richest denizen.Mark Zuckerberg's Westchester abodeGoogle Maps ;  SPACE / SIPA USA / PA ImagesLike Warren Buffett, Mark Zuckerberg is a man of humble tastes, a virtue he shares with his parents Edward and Karen.
Born on 14 May 1984, the Facebook co-founder, chairman and CEO grew up in this fairly ordinary mid-century property in Dobbs Ferry, a sleepy town in Westchester County, New York.Mark Zuckerberg's Westchester abodeCourtesy Bio / Zuckerberg familyGiven the incredible fortune their son would go on to make, which Forbes estimates at $120.1 billion (£85.1bn), the Zuckerbergs could have easily retired and decamped to a lavish mansion, but the couple still live in the Dobbs Ferry home.Mark Zuckerberg's Westchester abodeNawaz Babar / YouTubeDentist Edward maintains his practice there – the office is attached to the property – though these days he has a business that helps other dentists use social media and new technology to their best advantage.Mark Zuckerberg's Westchester abode@painlessdrz / FacebookIn fact, if it wasn't for Edward's keenest to embrace emerging technologies, it's unlikely son Mark would have ever had the know-how to get Facebook off the ground.
An early adopter of painless, drill-free dentistry back in the 1980s, the Zuckerberg patriarch was also well ahead of the game in terms of the internet.Mark Zuckerberg's Westchester abode`Courtesy Dobbs Ferry DentalBack in 1996 when the technology was in its infancy, he had high-speed internet installed in his home and adjacent business, which would have been key to nurturing his son's expertise in the field, and was even a fan of social media well before Facebook came into existence.Bill Gates' Laurelhurst houseWindermere Real Estate Co. ; Frederic Legrand - COMEO / ShutterstockBorn on 28 October 1955, Bill Gates, who is now worth $126.8 billion (£89.9bn), spent much of his childhood in this gorgeous mid-century property in the tranquil Laurelhurst neighbourhood of Seattle.
Built in 1964, it was snapped up a year later by the Microsoft co-founder's father Bill Sr, who lived in the four-bedroom, five-bathroom property until his death last September at the ripe old age of 94.Bill Gates' Laurelhurst houseCourtesy Gates familyInterestingly, the family's previous home in the Sand Point neighbourhood was severely damaged by the area's first recorded tornado, which struck in 1962 when Bill Jr was seven years old.Bill Gates' Laurelhurst houseWindermere Real Estate Co.Several members of the extended Gates family ended up moving to Laurelhurst and there's even road there named after Bill Jr's mother Mary, who passed away in 1994.
From the outside, the mid-century property offers a stunning first impression, with a large gable window and balconies encircling the first floor.Bill Gates' Laurelhurst houseWindermere Real Estate Co.The 3,860-square-foot home was put on the market in early June with an asking price of $2.6 million (£1.8m) and an offer is pending at the time of writing.
Along with the breathtaking lake and mountain vistas it provides, the property has a whole host of highlights, including this stunning living room, complete with a large feature window and brick fireplace.Bill Gates' Laurelhurst houseWindermere Real Estate Co.Other standout features of the property range from a family room with floor-to-ceiling windows that flood the space with light, to a snug den, chef's kitchen and master bedroom that leads out to a spacious terrace.
There's also plenty of additional outside space and even a court for playing pickleball, which has long been one of Bill Jr's favourite sports and top ways to unwind.Elon Musk's Pretoria padJMK [CC BY-SA 3.0] ;  Naresh777 / ShutterstockElon Musk arrived on Planet Earth on 28 June 1971 and spent his formative years in the upscale suburb of Waterkloof in Pretoria, South Africa.
The family comfortably resided in one of the neighbourhood's biggest homes.Elon Musk's Pretoria pad@mayemusk / TwitterElon was born into a reasonably well-off family – his engineer father Errol is said to have part-owned an emerald mine in Zambia (though Elon denies this), while his mother Maye worked as a model and dietician.Elon Musk's Pretoria padCourtesy Maye MuskA super-bright kid, the co-founder of PayPal, Tesla and SpaceX badgered his father for a computer at the age of six or seven and swiftly taught himself how to program it.
He is pictured here in the garden of the Pretoria home sometime in the 1970s with his mother Maye and younger siblings Kimbal and Tosca.Elon Musk's Pretoria padCourtesy Maye MuskThis snap from the family album also shows the three siblings in the garden, where they no doubt spent many happy times.
Incidentally, all three kids have done exceptionally well.
Kimbal is a chef and restaurateur, who has an estimated fortune of $500 million (£354m), while Tosca is an acclaimed filmmaker.Elon Musk's Pretoria padCourtesy Maye MuskAnother shot from Maye's collection shows the children on their way to school.
Musk was bullied relentlessly and even had a two-week spell in hospital after he was thrown down a flight of stairs by a group of boys.
He's certainly had the last laugh.
At the time of writing, the genius entrepreneur and visionary is worth a very satisfying $153.2 billion (£108.6bn).Jeff Bezos' Cotulla ranchLoren Elliott / AFP via Getty ; lev radin / ShutterstockJeff Bezos was born on 12 January 1964 in Albuquerque to Jacklyn Gise and Ted Jørgensen, who were aged just 17 and 19 respectively.

The internet entrepreneur credits the time he spent with his grandfather on the ranch for making him self-reliant and resourceful.Jeff Bezos' Cotulla ranchCourtesy Bezos familySpeaking at an event in India last year, the centibillionaire told the audience that this self-reliance, which involved everything from erecting fences and fixing windmills to suturing livestock and even building a whole home from scratch, made a big impression on him and taught him a plethora of valuable life lessons.Jeff Bezos' Cotulla ranchCourtesy Bezos family via Summit LAThis time spent toiling away on the ranch certainly stood him in good stead.
His belief that “constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention", picked up from those working summers is written into Amazon's DNA, and was instrumental in making the site a huge success and its founder a huge fortune, which currently stands at a staggering $193.4 billion (£137.1bn).Steven Spielberg's New Jersey cottageZillow ; Denis Makarenko / ShutterstockThis charming clapboard cottage was a childhood home of Oscar-winning filmmaker Steven Spielberg.
Born on 18 December 1946, Steven moved to the property at the age of five when his family snapped it up for a mere $14,000 (£9.9k) in 1952.Steven Spielberg's New Jersey cottageCourtesy Natalie GuttmanPictured on the right in this childhood photograph, young Steven stayed in the New Jersey home for five years before the family relocated to Arizona.
While his time at the property was brief, Spielberg has said that his passion for filmmaking was sparked when he saw the 1952 filmThe Greatest Show on Earthat a local movie theatre.Steven Spielberg's New Jersey cottageZillowBuilt in 1949, the three-bedroom, two-bathroom colonial-style home in the township of Haddonfield is modest but comfortable.
Just a 20-minute drive from the bustling heart of Philadelphia, it would've offered the Spielberg family an idyllic slice of suburbia.Steven Spielberg's New Jersey cottageZillowThe 1,452-square-foot residence accommodated Steven, his parents, Leah and Arnold, along with his younger sisters, Anne and Sue – the youngest of the brood, Nancy, arrived in 1956 while the family were still living in New Jersey.
The property was last on the market in 2014, when it sold for a reasonable $249,000 (£178k).Steven Spielberg's New Jersey cottageZillowAmong Steven's first forays into filmmaking was the Second World War short filmEscape to Nowhere, which he wrote and directed at the age of just 14, four years after the Spielbergs swapped Haddonfield for Phoenix, Arizona.
With no end of acclaimed blockbusters under his belt, fromJaws,Jurassic ParkandIndiana Jones, toSaving Private RyanandSchindler's List, it's no surprise that he has a net worth of $3.7 billion (£2.6bn), according to the latest figures fromForbes.Loved this?Follow us on Facebookfor more homes of the rich and famousShare the love17 June 2021FeaturesSee more on this topicCommentsBe the first to commentNewestOldestView All ( {{ vm.comments.length }} )Do you want tocomment on this article?You need to besigned infor this featureShare the love+ Add CommentHomeHomeCUSTOMER SERVICESARTICLE ARCHIVESTERMS OF USEPRIVACY POLICYCOOKIE POLICYDISCLAIMERAbout lovePROPERTYAboutAboutlovemoneylovefoodloveexploringloveincorporatedjobsRunpathloveproperty.com36 Featherstone StreetLondonEC1Y 8AELoveEverything.com Limited, a company registered in England and Wales.Company registration number: 07255787Copyright ©loveproperty.comAll rights reserved.Terms of use|Privacy policy|Disclaimer

Songs the World's Greatest Minds Are Listening To | HypebeastLatestSectionsVideosBrandsShopGlobalFollowWhat Music Are the World’s Greatest Minds Listening To?From the likes of Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, Mark Zuckerberg and more.Yichuan Cao/Nurphoto/Getty ImagesMusicOct 25, 201761,454 Hypes0CommentsMusicOct 25, 201761,454 Hypes0CommentsText ByHP CheungShare this articleIt’s easy to forget that the world’s greatest minds — scientists, presidents, businessmen and geniuses — enjoy “regular people” activities like listening to music.
Professor David Ludden hasonce statedthat music is a universal language, having the power to evoke deep primal feelings at the core of the shared human experience, reaching deep into our evolutionary past.
So, even if one has a high IQ, music is just as important him or her as it would for be anybody else.
We’ve put together a look at the music preferences of the 12 of today’s greatest minds below, including that of Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Stephen Hawking and others.
And unlike what many music snobs like to believe, taste in music is not an accurate determination of one’s intellect — at least from what we’ve gathered below.Elon MuskFavorite artists:Frank Sinatra, Andrea Bocelli, “Weird Al” YankovicThere’s a lot of talk about thepossibility of a music streaming platformin Tesla but not much aboutElon Musk‘s actual music tastes.
In 2011, Santa Monica College’s National Public Radio member station KCRW 89.9FM took a field trip to the SpaceX headquarters to visit and have a chat with Elon Musk.
In their conversation, the Tesla and SpaceX founder shared afew of of his favorite songsat the time: Frank Sinatra’s “Fly Me To the Moon,” Monty Python’s “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life,” Team America World Police’s “America, F*ck Yeah!” and Andrea Bocelli’s “Con Te Partiro.” He says that “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town” is his favorite song to whistle, even though he doesn’t “understand why.” He’s also revealed that he is a fan of“Weird Al” Yankovic— which he has played in one of his Tesla’s many times — as well asThe Lego Movie‘s“Everything is Awesome.”Mark ZuckerbergFavorite artists:Daft Punk, Lady Gaga, EminemIn 2016, Facebook CEOMark Zuckerberg‘s builtJarvis.
It was an artificially intelligent, voice-controlled assistant for his home, which had the ability to recommend music to himself and his wife, Priscilla Chan, based on what it learned about their song preferences.
In high school — long before the days of Facebook — Zuck and his friend Adam D’Angelodeveloped a similar app called Synapse, an MP3 player that could analyze what listeners liked and suggest playlists.
Zuckerberg and D’Angelo even turned down a $950,000 offer for the software because they wanted to go to college instead.
When it comes to the music though, not much is known about what Mark Zuckerberg really enjoys listening to.
He’s once revealed thathis favorite musiciansinclude Daft Punk and Lady Gaga and in 2011 tweeted that “had a dream I was king.
I woke up, still king” from Eminem, Royce Da 5’9” and Bruno Mars’ “Lighters” is his “favorite lyric in awhile [sic].”Barack ObamaFavorite artists:Marvin Gaye, Kendrick Lamar, JAY-ZBy far the most media-friendly and culturally hip person on this list, many publications have documentedBarack Obamaand his fondness of music throughout his years in office.
He has createdcountless playlistsfor occasions ranging from his official inauguration to Christmas holidays, featuring artists ranging from Leon Bridges to Otis Redding, Bob Dylan, Sheryl Crow to the Rolling Stones.
In October 2016, the former POTUS revealed what nobody else on this list had ever talked about — histop 5 favorite rappers— JAY-Z, Kanye West, Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper.
He has invited many musicians, artists and rappers to the White House, including Frank Ocean, Chance, Wale and more.
He shared in 2015 thathis favorite song of the yearis Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp A Butterfly cut “How Much A Dollar Cost.”George R. R. MartinFavorite music:Grateful Dead,The Wizard of OzMusic has always been a big part ofGame of Thrones.
Many of its actors for characters like Greyworm, Hodor and Ramsay Bolton, are alsomusicians and artists in real life.
Severalacclaimed artists have made cameosthroughout the seasons, including Ed Sheeran, Mastodon, Coldplay’s Will Champion, Snow Patrol’s Gary Lightbody, Sigur Rós and Of Monsters and Men.
The series, after all, is based onGeorge R. R. Martin‘sASongof Ice and Fire.
In an interview withNew York’s 92nd Street Yin 2015, Martin confirmed the Grateful Dead influence onGame of Thrones.
I’m certainly a fan of the Grateful Dead,” MartintoldSalonin 2014.“I have Grateful Dead lyrics rattling around in my head all the time,” he continues.
Ripple’ is one of my favorite songs of all time.” Martin’s also rankedThe Wizard of Ozashis third-favorite fantasy film, with one reason being that “the music is marvelous.”Neil deGrasse TysonFavorite artists:Aretha Franklin, Koko Taylor, Van MorrisonDr.
Neil deGrasse Tyson, famed astrophysicist, oncebrought GZA onStarTalk— a show he hosts on The Nerdist — to talk about the relationship between music and science.
He is also well-known forshutting down B.o.Bfor his “flat Earth” theories, his work with Logic on his latest albumEverybodyandhis conversationswith the rapper, and appearing on Tyler the Creator’s Viceland showNUTS + BOLTS.
KCRW, the same folks that brought in Elon Musk as guest DJ, also once got Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson as one of its music curators in 2015.
The famed astrophysicist namedblues as his favorite genre, but also picked out a wide variety of selections ranging from gospel to prog rock.
The five tracks he handpicked were Koko Taylor’s “I’m A Woman,” Aretha Franklin’s “Old Landmark,” Van Morrison’s “Moondance,” Styx’s “Come Sail Away” and Louis Armstrong’s “What A Wonderful World.”Jack MaFavorite music:Righteous Brothers, Michael Jackson,The Lion KingThe biggest music lover (and performer) on this list is awarded toJack Ma.
Earlier this month, Ma — China’s richest man (at a $39.3 billion net worth) and founder of Alibaba Group — crashed singer Li Jian’s set at China’s Yunqi Music Festivalto sing a medley of songs, beginning with “Unchained Melody,” followed by “I Finally Lost You” by Jonathan Lee and “When I’m Thinking of You” by Wang Feng.
The performance lasted over 15 minutes and the magnate was wearing sunglasses, a jean jacket and a popped collar.
Last month, Ma attended his company’s 18th anniversary birthday bashdressed as Michael Jackson.
He rode onstage in a black motorcycle and struck a few signature MJ poses in a black and gold outfit.
Back in 2014, an Alibaba employee recountedMa singing songs from popular Disney filmLion Kingto a stadium of over 16,000 employees.Bill NyeFavorite artists:Frank Sinatra, Tommy Dorsey, Fred AstaireBill Nyemight be a Science Guy, but he’s certainly quite the music man as well.
In all but four episodes during his five-year run on PBS, Nye featured educational spoofs of pop songs in his show.
He’s evenmade a song with Steve Aokiand the theme song for his new Netflix showBill Nye Saves the Worldiswritten by Tyler, the Creator.In 2014 KCRW had Bill Nyeas their guest DJ, and Nye selected the following songs to play: Frank Sinatra’s “I’ve Got The World On A String,” Tommy Dorsey’s “Song of India,” Fred Astaire’s “The Carioca,” Ronny & The Daytonas’ “GTO” and Golden Earring “Radar Love.” In the episode, Nye says that music, from his understanding, “stimulates the same pleasure center that you get from drugs and being in love and gambling.” He evendedicated an entire episodeof his show to the science behind music.Bill GatesFavorite artists:David Bowie, Willie Nelson, The BeatlesWhile Steve Jobs wasmuch more outspokenabout his favorite musicians and songs,Bill Gateshad once revealed eight songs he would take with him to a desert island in aninterview with Kirsty Young, host of BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs.
The songs are as follows: “Under Pressure” by David Bowie and Queen, “Blue Skies” by Willie Nelson, “Sing” by Ed Sheeran, “Are You Experienced” by Jimi Hendrix, “One” by U2, “Two of Us” by The Beatles,The Sound of Music‘s “How Can Love Survive” and “My Shot” from Hamilton.
Gates revealed that Beatle’s “Two of Us” is one of his favorites because it’s “kind of like this journey [he and Steve Jobs had] been on where we’d been competing and working together.” Gates reveal that his three children refresh his taste in music, and that Sheeran’s “Sing” is a favorite of his daughter Phoebe.Stephen HawkingFavorite artists:Rod Stewart, The Beatles, Francis PoulencDespite suffering from a degenerative motor-neuron disease since the age of 21,Stephen Hawkingraised three children in his two marriages, make breaking discoveries and has written several best-selling books.
Another thing that Hawking is able to enjoy even in the midst of his condition is music.
In July 2015, Hawking revealedin a Reddit AMAthat his favorite song is Rod Stewart’s “Have I Told You Lately.” In an article titled10 Questions for Stephen Hawking, the scientist said that one “ordinary” interest that he has that might surprise people is his enjoyment of all forms of music, including pop, classical and opera.
Like Gates, Hawkings oncepicked the eight recordshe would most like to be cast away with on BBC’s Desert Island Discs.
He has also once chosen thethree pieces of classical musicthat mean the most to him at 2006’s Cambridge Music Festival — Igor Stravinsky’sSymphony Of Psalms, Henryk Wieniawski’sViolin Concerto No.
1and Francis Poulenc’sGloria.Jeff BezosFavorite music:Zac Brown Band, country musicUnlike most of the great minds on this list,Jeff Bezoswas not a music lover.
In fact, it has been revealed that Bezos has “a lack of interest in music of any kind.” As a teenager, Jeff memorized the call letters of local radio stations so he could fake his knowledgeability to the music scene.
He let Steve Jobshire away his music editor, Keith Moerer,ultimately letting Moere and Jobs seize the lead in creating the iPod.
However, Bezos has not given up on music just yet; he revealed in an interview withBillboardin February that he believes voice-activated home devices like Amazon Echo is the “next gigantic growth area” for the music industry.
While he is definitely passionate about the potential of the music industry and streaming, not much is known about his actual taste in music other than that he’s a fan of “Americana,” the Amazon music station that his business partner Steve Boom is in charge of and that he’s a fan of the Zac Brown Band.Hans ZimmerFavorite artists:Ennio Morricone, Kraftwerk, Giorgio MoroderHans Zimmeris by far the most well-known film composer of today and he has all the Oscar and Grammy awards to prove it.
Zimmer is the mastermind behind the music of popular films such asThe Lion King,Gladiator,The Dark Knight,Pirates of the Caribbean,Inceptionand many more.
In an“interview withIGN, Zimmer revealed that his favorite scores of all time are Ennio Morricone’sOnce Upon A Time in America, Giorgio Moroder’sMidnight Expressand Vangelis’Blade Runner.
Herevealed in a Reddit AMAthat Beethoven would be the one composer from history that wants to go back and meet because of the ingenuity and simplicity of his 5th symphony.
He also revealed that he loves Kraftwerk and that growing up, he really looked up to Mozart, The Rolling Stones and American blues man Lightning Hopkins.Read Full ArticleText ByHP CheungShare this articleBarack ObamaBill GatesJeff BezosMark ZuckerbergElon MuskHans ZimmerGeorge R.

It symobilizes a website link url.Copy LinkRead in appRedeem nowAmazon CEO Jeff BezosREUTERS/Shannon StapletonThe music business haslost billions of dollars over the past few years, but Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is bullish about its future.One big reason: the wider use of voice-activated home devices, like Amazon's Echo.
At this point in the marriage of voice-activation technology with music, I can tell you it’s already working," Bezos said in a newinterview with Billboard.
The next gigantic growth area for the music industry is the home.
Bezos said voice-controlled devices like the Echo and its Alexa technology make the music-playing experience simple and "friction-free," allowing more people to listen to music more frequently.“If you make things easier, people do more of it," he said.To illustrate Bezos' point, Amazon Music's VP Steve Boom explained how voice-activated devices could shorten the time it typically takes to play music on personal devices from five minutes to just five seconds.For example, in the past, if you wanted to listen to U2 from the '80s, you had to manually search for U2 albums and then individually look for the albums released in the '80s.
That took a lot of time.
Now, with voice-activated devices, you simply have to ask, "Hey, can you play me U2 songs from the '80s?"
and within seconds, it automatically curates songs for you.
When you have nothing to look at, it’s liberating...and when you talk to Alexa, you ask for music in ways that would be difficult to do in a visual app," Boom said.Boom even claimed people are listening to "more music than ever" because of this, adding that it would lead to a renaissance period for the music industry.
We’re at the cusp of what I would call the Golden Age of the music industry," he said.Although Bezos or Boom didn't share any actual data on usage, they may have a point if devices like Echo end up becoming a more mainstream product.
According to a recent survey, playing music was picked as the second most popular feature on the Echo.StatistaSign up for notifications from Insider!

Both Bezos and Biden apparently find the rush of a little soft serve on the palate to be irresistible.
Fortunately for Bezos, if you have $180 billion or so laying around, you don’t need to listen for the ice cream truck.
You just get soft serve on tap.View this post on InstagramA post shared by CVT Soft Serve (@cvtsoftserve)Not a single question from Biden's handpicked reporters about his favorite ice cream flavor.
That tells you a lot.pic.twitter.com/0tNcm2XKXn— Paula Bolyard (@pbolyard)August 20, 2021Los Angeles based CVT Soft Serve took to Instagram to dish on Bezos’ new soft serve tap: “I don’t expect you to believe what I’m about to tell you, but it’s 100% true.I’m still trying to mentally process this.
I just an ice cream delivery to a guy that now has CVT on tap in his house 247.Thank you Jeff Bezos for being our first residential #CVTeeny client.
Bezos’ CVT machine will likely serve vanilla, chocolate or twist in the event he’s feeling wild.Though the price of the cool-treat tap wasn’t given, Bezos probably didn’t finance the goods.
His net worth is reportedly $185 billion.
But in the event he wanted to save a couple of bucks, he could’ve taken the elevator down to his basement (which I’ll assume is just a giant Amazon warehouse) and grabbed aVevor 2200wCommercial Soft Ice Cream Machine for just under $1,800 bones.Your move Elon Musk.AmazonCVT soft serveElon MuskJeff BezosPresident BidenWritten byAnthony Farris3 CommentsLeave a ReplySalty Saltinesays:August 21, 2021 at 2:14 pmWow AF if this is news scrapping the bottom of the barrelLog in to ReplyJarrod Wadesays:August 21, 2021 at 2:16 pmI bet you’re lots of fun at parties.Log in to ReplySalty Saltinesays:August 21, 2021 at 6:30 pmMaybeLog in to ReplyLeave a ReplyCancel replyYou must belogged into post a comment.More From:CultureHidden C-Bomb Gets Eco-Conscious Shirt Axed From Canadian Walmarts; Becomes Big Seller On AmazonMatt ReiglePaige Spiranac Gets Naked & Dives Into A Tub Of Golf Balls For The InternetJoe KinseyBiden Just Signed A Law Ending The Covid Emergency, And No – Djokovic Still Can’t Play HereMike GunzelmanMystery Creature Spotted In Texas, Men Lie About Size, Tua Rocks A ‘Stache, Steak & Eggs And Ugly Expensive FashionAmber HardingNewsletterGet the Daily OutKick and get smarter every day.Email address:Leave this field empty if you're human:You are agreeing to OutKick'sTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy, but don't worry we don't spam.Terms of UseUpdated Privacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesHelpAbout UsPressDISCLAIMER: This site is 100% for entertainment purposes only and does not involve real money betting.

Wondering why?
The reason is Jeff Bezos, the founder of e-commerce giant Amazon, who has recently bought and installed an unlimited soft-serve ice-cream machine at his residence.According to an Instagram post dated August 16, by ice cream firm CVT Soft Serve, they installed an ice cream machine at Jeff’s residence in LA.

I/m still trying to mentally process this.
I just did an ice cream delivery to a guy that now has CVT on tap in his house 24/7.⁣ Thank you Jeff Bezos for being our first residential #CVTeeny client."
The post included a photo of CVT Soft Serve founder, Joe Nicchi.For the uninitiated, the CVTeeny, which looks like a mini-truck, is a soft-serve ice cream machine by CVT Soft Serve.
The machine comes with a customized “license plate" on the front that looks like a food truck.
If we go by the company’s website, they serve chocolate, vanilla, and twist soft-serve.As per the grapevine, Bezos is a fan of soft-serve ice cream and he can’t resist it.Are you also a soft-serve ice cream fan?

In 2019, just days after his divorce from his wife of 25 years Mackenzie Scott was finalised, the Blue Origin boss was spotted treating himself and his children to ice-cream at New York's Milk Bar.Ice-cream cravings are a real thing - age, borders, time zones notwithstanding.
And while most of these cravings normally have to be satiated by a visit to the ice-cream parlour or waiting to hear the bell of the gelato truck/vendor out in the street, but not if you are the world's richest man.
Because then, you simply set up your own soft-serve machine right at home.Amazon founderJeff Bezos, having fulfilled his dream of going to space, is ensuring that Earthly 'any-time ice-cream' desires are met.
Bezos has used a part (a tiny part) of his $191.3 billion wealth to install anice-cream machineat home.Los Angeles-basedCVT Soft Serverevealed onInstagramthat they put one of theirCVTeenysoft serve machines in the billionaire's SoCal home.“I don't expect you to believe what I'm about to tell you, but it's 100% true.

I happily chowed down on all of themUnfortunately, they were out ofElon Musk.I’d traveled nearly two hours from my home in Upstate New York to Washington Square Park in Manhattan with a very clear mission: I was going to visit the viral “Eat the Rich” pop-up ice cream truck — which sells five different popsicles featuring the faces of famous billionaires — and eat one of each.
Then I was going to rank them according to how good they tasted.
But when the ice cream truck’s window opened for its third and final day in business, I discovered that not only wereallthe popsicles the same flavor — which makes a flavor ranking pointless — but also that theMuskversion was no longer available.My arrivalWhile I was disappointed, I made the most of things by ordering the four remaining popsicles — at $10 a piece — and began to stuff my face with them, beginning withMark Zuckerberg.The menuI chose to start withZuckerbergbecause I thought, of the five popsicles, his likeness was the best.
In fairness,allof them are pretty great, but there was something about the Zuckerberg popsicle that was downright uncanny.
Perhaps it’s because the man already looks like a popsicle?
I don’t know.
Seriously, just look at it — it’s astounding.Me, about to eat Mark ZuckerbergWhen I bit into his head,Mark Zuckerbergtasted quite good.
The popsicle kind of had a nondescript, vaguely vanilla sherbet-like flavor, but it was still sweet and satisfying.
Nikitas, the guy who was running the truck, told me that he also had detected a hint ofbananaflavor in there, which seemed about right.
Nikitas is a man who knows what he’s talking about too, as he’s an ice cream truck veteran and can clearly distinguish between the flavors ofSonic,SpongeBoband all the different character popsicles he normally sells.Nikitas, popsicle expertIn the hour I spent hanging around the ice cream truck, it never got too crowded.
At most, a line of maybe a half dozen people would form, then there would be a lull with nobody there at all (except a handful of other journalists, but I’m not counting them).
This gave me a chance to chat with Nikitas, who informed me that, thanks to the media attention over the past few days — in outlets like theNew York PostandTMZ— business had picked up steadily on the second day, and he expected even more on the truck’s final day.As for why it was only a three-day venture, Nikitas didn’t know, but when I spoke to the men behind the whole operation, they explained that three days was standard practice for this kind of thing, which they’ve donemanytimes.To that end,Eat the Rich Popsiclesis just the latest project of a Brooklyn-based organization calledMSCHF— pronounced “Mischief” — which artists and founding membersLukas BentelandKevin Wiesnerdescribe as an “art collective.” But, Wiesner admits, “We call it an [that] because no one really knows what that means.”In addition to Eat the Rich, MSCHF has been behind a wide variety of art projects that havecaptured headlines and gotten them into legal trouble.
Last year, they were sued by Nike for selling “satan shoes,” which were modified Nike Air Max 97s containing actual human blood.
Also last year, they mounted a paintball gun on a robotic police dog as a statement protesting the use of such robots by police.
That one earned them a formal rebuke by the company that makes the robots.
Rounding out 2021, last fall, they created a two-day pop-up store called 8-Twelve — a play on7-Eleven— which sold fake products that parodied real ones.Although Eat the Rich popsicles weren’t sold in 8-Twelve, Bentel and Wiesner tell me that the store featured a sign for aJeff Bezospopsicle that a lot of people seemed to like, so they eventually decided to pursue that idea with two genuine ice cream trucks — one in New York, one in L.A. — that offered popsicles that look like billionaires.
While Bentel and Wiesner gave a somewhat vague, artistic answer on the statement behind Eat the Rich — explaining that it was a comment on “American consumerism” — they made clear that this was inprotestof these uber-rich magantes, not in admiration of them.Speaking ofBezos, after finishing up myZuckerbergpopsicle, I next decided to try his popsicle, which waseasilythe number-one seller when I was there, given the absence of Musk.
He tasted much the same asZuckerberg, but there was something quite surprising about the popsicle.
Despite the fact that the packaging featuredblackgumball eyes, Bezos’ eyes were burning red.
When I mentioned this later to Bentel and Wiesner, they were completely shocked by this, too, as they’d designed him with black eyes.Note the piercing red eyes“He has the eyes of the devil,” Nikitas said to me, as he also explained thatallthe Jeff Bezos popsicles he’d seen were red-eyed.
Either way, it seemed to meet consumers where they were at, aseveryonewho bought Bezos popsicles hated the guy.
I don’t like him at all,” a customer named Tara told me.
Another customer named Miles added, “I got Jeff Bezos because he’s bald.
And I don’t like him very much.”Eyes of the devil indeed.I quickly gobbled Bezos up before he could consume my soul.As for the others on offer, when I bit into the gray hair ofBill Gates, I finally tasted something different, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on the flavor.
When talking to Bentel and Wiesner, they explained that the flavoring chosen for the popsicles had nothing to do with each billionaire.
Instead, it was about which flavors came standard in the colors they needed.
ForGates’ hair, they thought itmayhave been maple, but they couldn’t quite remember.
For the most part though, all the popsicles were primarily that peachy skin-tone color — which comes standard with vanilla flavor — so they did all taste pretty much the same.This also kind of looks like a Roger Ebert popsicle.Of all the billionaires offered, Gates seemed to garner theleastamount of animosity.
Bill Gates has at least done some charity work,” a customer named Rob told me as he was buying a Bezos head to munch on.
I also ran into a group of five guys from Seattle, four of which had selected Gates because he was from their hometown.
The fifth chose Jack Ma, but he didn’t really offer a reason.The guys from Seattle, eating Bill Gates out of hometown prideAfter I was around the truck for about 40 minutes, Jeff Bezos popsicles had completely sold out, and a few minutes after that, the Zuckerberg popsicles were all gone as well.
By the time I was leaving, Nikitas informed me that he was into the last box ofBill Gates, though he still had five boxes left of Jack Ma, who, I guess, people didn’t know as well.To be honest, I didn’t know much about him either, but I do now know that he makes for a pretty tasty popsicle.My Jack Ma came with a fucked-up face.
I guess it’s just as well.Finally, there’s the one that got away —Elon Musk.
While I guess, given his insatiable need for media attention, it’s not that surprising thatMuskwas the most popular popsicle, what surprised me aboutMuskwas that the people who came to the truck to eat him actuallylikehim.
He’s the coolest one they have,” I was told by a guy named Fausto.
And a couple named Vladimir and Julia said they were both fans ofElon Muskand were disappointed that he wasn’t available.Vladimir and Julia, who came for Musk, but left with Gates and Zuckerberg.I guess the silver lining for Musk is, if self-driving cars, brain chips and commercial space travel don’t work out or he does have to fork over a court-mandated $44 billion for Twitter, there’s always the popsicle business.Brian VanHookerBrian VanHooker is a staff writer at MEL specializing in pop culture, food (especially pizza) and long form oral histories.

20 Inspirational Books That Jeff Bezos Recommends Reading - BrooksySkip to contentBrooksyAn Enlightened SocietyBrooksyAn Enlightened SocietyBillionairesExecutivesBooksDay TradingTravelShopContactSearch …BooksReading Lists20 Inspirational Books That Jeff Bezos Recommends ReadingNicholas DunehewJuly 27, 2021Book RecommendationsBooksJeff BezosJeff Bezos Book RecommendationsFor many reasons, self-made billionaire Jeff Bezos and books simply go hand in hand.
To begin with, he catapulted his way to becoming the richest man on Earth after founding what started as an online bookstore named Amazon.
Researching the origins of this harmonious relationship takes us to the small town where his grandfather lived – a place he often spent time during childhood summers – and a tiny little Andrew Carnegie-style library where all the books had been donated from local citizens.“This was a very small library, but it had an extensive science fiction collection, because it just so happened one of the residents of this 3,000-person town had been a science fiction fan, and donated their whole collection,”he says.
And that started a love affair for me with people like Heinlein and Asimov and all the well-known science fiction authors that persists to this day.”It goes without saying, since an early age, reading has played a profound role in shaping Jeff Bezos as a person, and furthermore, this favorite educational activity of his must have had something to do with the spirited – and profitable for that matter – approach he takes to life.Therefore, in order to get to the bottom of what inspired the world’s wealthiest man to the pinnacle of financial success, we’ve compiled a list of 20 books that Jeff Bezos has read himself and would certainly recommend to others as well.This guide to Jeff Bezos’ favorite books was created with the help of interviews, articles, and really one book in particular calledThe Everything Storeby Brad Stone.
In his definitive biography of the Amazon company, Stone shares a list of books whose knowledge Jeff Bezos leaned on during the forming of Amazon.
With that being said, Stone’s well-studied comments are commonly cited throughout our list, along with a number of other sources.We give you, 20 inspirational books that Jeff Bezos recommends reading.Built to Lastby Jim CollinsDrawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies and studied each in direct comparison to one of its top competitors.
They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day – as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations.
Throughout, the authors asked: “What makes the truly exceptional companies different from the comparison companies and what were the common practices these enduringly great companies followed throughout their history?”Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels,Built to Lastprovides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the 21st century and beyond.Source:“My favorite business book isBuilt to Last,” Bezos revealed toFast Companyduring an interview.
As Brad Stone puts it,this famous management read explains how companies that succeed build environments where employees who embrace the central mission flourish.Creationby Steve GrandWorking mostly alone, almost single-handedly writing 250,000 lines of computer code, Steve Grand producedCreatures, a revolutionary computer game that allowed players to create living beings complete with brains, genes, and hormonal systems – creatures that would live and breathe and breed in real time on an ordinary desktop computer.Enormously successful, the game inevitably raises the question: What is artificial life?
And in this book – a chance for the devoted fan and the simply curious onlooker to see the world from the perspective of an original philosopher-engineer and intellectual maverick – Steve Grand proposes an answer.From the composition of the brains and bodies of artificial life forms to the philosophical guidelines and computational frameworks that define them,Creationplumbs the practical, social, and ethical aspects and implications of the state of the art.
But more than that, the book gives readers access to the insights Grand acquired in writingCreatures –insights that yield a view of the world that is surprisingly antireductionist, antimaterialist, and (to a degree) antimechanistic, a view that sees matter, life, mind, and society as simply different levels of the same thing.
Such a hierarchy, Grand suggests, can be mirrored by an equivalent one that exists inside a parallel universe called cyberspace.Source:“A video game designer argues that intelligent systems can be created from the bottom up if one devises a set of primitive building blocks,”Stone writes.
The book was influential in the creation of Amazon Web Services, or AWS, the service that popularized the notion of the cloud.”Reworkby Jason Fried and David Heinemeier HanssonFrom the founders of the trailblazing software company 37signals, here is a different kind of business book one that explores a new reality.
Today, anyone can be in business.
Tools that used to be out of reach are now easily accessible.
Technology that cost thousands is now just a few bucks or even free.
Stuff that was impossible just a few years ago is now simple.
That means anyone can start a business.
And you can do it without working miserable 80-hour weeks or depleting your life savings.
You can start it on the side while your day job provides all the cash flow you need.
Forget about business plans, meetings, office space you don’t need them.With its straightforward language and easy-is-better approach,Reworkis the perfect playbook for anyone who’s ever dreamed of doing it on their own.
Hardcore entrepreneurs, small-business owners, people stuck in day jobs who want to get out, and artists who don’t want to starve anymore will all find valuable inspiration and guidance in these pages.
It’s time to rework work.Source:“Unperturbed by conventional wisdom, Jason and David start fresh and rewrite the rules of business.
Their approach turns out to be as successful as it is counter-intuitive,”Jeff Bezos remarkedafter reading the book.The Black Swanby Nassim Nicholas TalebA black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was.
The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11.
For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur?
Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities.
We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don’t know.
We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the “impossible.”For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do.
We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world.
In this revelatory book, Taleb will change the way you look at the world, and this second edition features a new philosophical and empirical essay, “On Robustness and Fragility,” which offers tools to navigate and exploit a Black Swan world.Source:“The scholar argues that people are wired to see patterns in chaos while remaining blind to unpredictable events, with massive consequences.
Experimentation and empiricism trumps the easy and obvious narrative,” Stone says.The Innovator’s Dilemmaby Clayton M. ChristensenThe bestselling classic on disruptive innovation, by renowned author Clayton M. Christensen.
His work is cited by the world’s best-known thought leaders, from Steve Jobs to Malcolm Gladwell.
In this classic bestseller – one of the most influential business books of all time – innovation expert Clayton Christensen shows how even the most outstanding companies can do everything right – yet still lose market leadership.Christensen explains why most companies miss out on new waves of innovation.
No matter the industry, he says, a successful company with established productswillget pushed aside unless managers know how and when to abandon traditional business practices.Offering both successes and failures from leading companies as a guide,The Innovator’s Dilemmagives you a set of rules for capitalizing on the phenomenon of disruptive innovation.Source:Dilemma,Stone says, helped spur on the creation of the Kindle and Amazon Web Services – two product lines that are quite far from Amazon’s original business.
Why would they do such a thing?
Some companies are reluctant to embrace disruptive technology because it might alienate customers and undermine their core business,” he adds.
but Christensen argues that ignoring potential disruption is even costlier.”Sam Walton: Made in AmericabySam WaltonMeet a genuine American folk hero cut from the homespun cloth of America’s heartland: Sam Walton, who parlayed a single dime store in a hardscrabble cotton town into Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world.
The undisputed merchant king of the late twentieth century, Sam never lost the common touch.

Sam shares his thinking in a candid, straight-from-the-shoulder style.In a story rich with anecdotes and the “rules of the road” of both Main Street and Wall Street, Sam Walton chronicles the inspiration, heart, and optimism that propelled him to lasso the American Dream.Source:“In his autobiography, Walmart’s founder expounds on the principles of discount retailing and discusses his core values of frugality and a bias for action – a willingness to try a lot of things and make many mistakes,” Stone writes.

So is his marriage.
He has ninety days to save his plant – or it will be closed by corporate HQ, with hundreds of job losses.
It takes a chance meeting with a professor from student days – Jonah – to help him break out of conventional ways of thinking to see what needs to be done.
The story of Alex’s fight to save his plant is more than compulsive reading.
It contains a serious message for all managers in industry and explains the ideas, which underline the Theory of Constraints (TOC), developed by Eli Goldratt.One of Eli Goldratt’s convictions was that the goal of an individual or an organization should not be defined in absolute terms.
A good definition of a goal is one that sets us on a path of ongoing improvement.Pursuing such a goal necessitates more than one breakthrough.
In fact it requires many.
To be in a position to identify these breakthroughs we should have a deep understanding of the underlying rules of our environment.Source:“An exposition of the science of manufacturing written in the guise of the novel, the book encourages companies to identify the biggest constraints in their operations,” Stone explains.
And then structure their organizations to get the most out of those constraints.”Lean Thinkingby James P. Womack and Daniel T. JonesThis bestselling business classic by two internationally renowned management analysts describes a business system for the twenty-first century that supersedes the mass production system of Ford, the financial control system of Sloan, and the strategic system of Welch and GE.
It is based on the Toyota (lean) model, which combines operational excellence with value-based strategies to produce steady growth through a wide range of economic conditions.In contrast with the crash-and-burn performance of companies trumpeted by business gurus in the 1990s, the firms profiled inLean Thinking– from tiny Lantech to midsized Wiremold to niche producer Porsche to gigantic Pratt & Whitney – have kept on keeping on, largely unnoticed, along a steady upward path through the market turbulence and crushed dreams of the early twenty-first century.
Meanwhile, the leader in lean thinking – Toyota – has set its sights on leadership of the global motor vehicle industry in this decade.Instead of constantly reinventing business models, lean thinkers go back to basics by asking what the customer really perceives asvalue.
It’s often not at all what existing organizations and assets would suggest.)
The next step is to line up value-creating activities for a specific product along avalue streamwhile eliminating activities (usually the majority) that don’t add value.
Then the lean thinker creates aflowcondition in which the design and the product advance smoothly and rapidly at thepullof the customer (rather than the push of the producer).
Finally, as flow and pull are implemented, the lean thinker speeds up the cycle of improvement in pursuit ofperfection.Source:Noted in CNBC’slist of 12 booksthat shaped the way Jeff Bezos, now the world’s richest man, thinks about success.Good to Greatby Jim CollinsBuilt to Last,the defining management study of the nineties, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the very beginning.But what about the company that is not born with great DNA?
How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness?For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins.
Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority?
And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great?Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years.
How great?
After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world’s greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck.The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great.
What was different?
Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good?Over five years, the team analyzed the histories of all twenty-eight companies in the study.
After sifting through mountains of data and thousands of pages of interviews, Collins and his crew discovered the key determinants of greatness – why some companies make the leap and others don’t.Source:Back in 2001, Amazon was just four years old – struggling to get its footing after the dot-com bust.
Looking to Collins for advice, Bezos phoned the author and eventually invited him over to visit the Amazon campus,Inc.

Stevens, at the end of three decades of service at Darlington Hall, spending a day on a country drive, embarks as well on a journey through the past in an effort to reassure himself that he has served humanity by serving the “great gentleman,” Lord Darlington.
But lurking in his memory are doubts about the true nature of Lord Darlington’s “greatness,” and much graver doubts about the nature of his own life.Source:“My favorite novel isThe Remains of the Day,” Bezos revealed toFast Company.Memos from the Chairmanby Alan GreenbergAlan C.

With a blend of software engineering facts and thought-provoking opinions, Fred Brooks offers insight for anyone managing complex projects.
These essays draw from his experience as project manager for the IBM System/360 computer family and then for OS/360, its massive software system.
Now, 20 years after the initial publication of his book, Brooks has revisited his original ideas and added new thoughts and advice, both for readers already familiar with his work and for readers discovering it for the first time.Source:Amazon is ruled by slices: that is, there’s aTwo Pizza Rulethat governs the size of teams – none should be bigger than what could be fed by two pizzas, acknowledgesFast Company.This lunch-sized heuristic draws from the work of National Medal of Technology-winning software engineer Frederick P.

Data-driven marketing improves efficiency and effectiveness of marketing expenditures across the spectrum of marketing activities from branding and awareness, trail and loyalty, to new product launch and Internet marketing.
Based on new research from the Kellogg School of Management, this book is a clear and convincing guide to using a more rigorous, data-driven strategic approach to deliver significant performance gains from your marketing.Source:“[This is] a guide to using data to measure everything from customer satisfaction to the effectiveness of marketing,” Stone writes.
Amazon employees must support all assertions with data, and if the data has a weakness, they must point it out or their colleagues will do it for them.”The Effective Executiveby Peter DruckerThe measure of the executive, Peter F. Drucker reminds us, is the ability to “get the right things done.” This usually involves doing what other people have overlooked as well as avoiding what is unproductive.
Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge may all be wasted in an executive job without the acquired habits of mind that mold them into results.Drucker identifies five practices essential to business effectiveness that can, and must, be learned: managing time, choosing what to contribute to the organization, knowing where and how to mobilize strength for best effect, setting the right priorities, and knitting all of them together with effective decision-making.Ranging widely through the annals of business and government, Peter F. Drucker demonstrates the distinctive skill of the executive and offers fresh insights into old and seemingly obvious business situations.Source:In an interview thataired on CNBC, a topic of discussion was books Jeff Bezos has recommended to Amazon’s top executives.The Innovator’s Solutionby Clayton ChristensenInThe Innovator’s Solution, Clayton Christensen and Michael Raynor expand on the idea of disruption, explaining how companies can and should become disruptors themselves.
This classic work shows just how timely and relevant these ideas continue to be in today’s hyper-accelerated business environment.Christensen and Raynor give advice on the business decisions crucial to achieving truly disruptive growth and propose guidelines for developing your own disruptive growth engine.
The authors identify the forces that cause managers to make bad decisions as they package and shape new ideas – and offer new frameworks to help create the right conditions, at the right time, for a disruption to succeed.

If natural selection can be said to play the role of a watchmaker in nature, it is a blind one – working without foresight or purpose.In an eloquent, uniquely persuasive account of the theory of natural selection, Dawkins illustrates how simple organisms slowly change over time to create a world of enormous complexity, diversity, and beauty.Source:Bezos delivered a message of utmost importance in the last paragraphs ofhis final letter to Amazon shareholders, which was released just a few months before he stepped down as CEO.

BanksThe Culture series is a science fiction series written by Scottish author Iain M. Banks, which was released from 1987 through 2012.
The stories center on The Culture, a utopian, post-scarcity space society of humanoid aliens, and advanced superintelligent artificial intelligences living in artificial habitats spread across the Milky Way galaxy.InExcession, Diplomat Byr Genar-Hofoen has been selected by the Culture to undertake a delicate and dangerous mission.
The Department of Special Circumstances – the Culture’s espionage and dirty tricks section – has sent him off to investigate a 2,500-year-old mystery: the sudden disappearance of a star fifty times older than the universe itself.
But in seeking the secret of the lost sun, Byr risks losing himself.There is only one way to break the silence of millennia: steal the soul of the long-dead starship captain who first encountered the star, and convince her to be reborn.
And in accepting this mission, Byr will be swept into a vast conspiracy that could lead the universe into an age of peace or to the brink of annihilation.Source:“Happy to announce that Amazon Studios is adapting Iain M. Banks’ amazing Culture series – a huge personal favorite – as a TV series.

Spanning a range of topics across business and public policy, from innovation and customer obsession to climate change and outer space, this book provides a rare glimpse into how Bezos thinks about the world and where the future might take us.Written in a direct, down-to-earth style,Invent and Wanderoffers readers a master class in business values, strategy, and execution: the importance of a Day 1 mindset, why “it’s all about the long term,” what itreallymeans to be customer-obsessed, how to start new businesses and create significant organic growth in an already successful company, why culture is imperative, and how a willingness to fail is closely connected to innovation.Each insight offers new ways of thinking through today’s challenges – and more importantly, tomorrow’s – and the never-ending urgency of striving ahead, never resting on one’s laurels.

From tension in Belarus, to Derek Chauvin's trial.TENSION IN BELARUSBY GUSTAVO REGO '23During a routine flight from Athens, Greece to Vilnius, Lithuania, passengers of the Ryanair flight found themselves being redirected to the capital of Belarus, Minsk.
They were escorted there by a Belarusian fighter jet, under the pretense of a bomb threat by the Palestinian organisation Hamas.
Upon touching down in Minsk, a search of the plane found that no bomb was on board, and the flight was cleared to continue to Vilnius.
However, Belarusian journalist and critic of the government Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend stayed behind.
They were arrested as soon as the plane had touched down.Protasevich was until recently the editor of Nexta, a Telegram channel that was strongly against the government of Belarus.
Nexta has been used for organizing anti-government protests, leading to Protasevich being considered a terrorist by the Belarusian government.
Because of this, he is facing up to 15 years in prison.
He has also written articles condemning the leader of Belarus, President Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994.As this is still very much a developing story, there are many details that are unclear.
The government of Belarus still maintains their claim that a bomb threat was made towards the flight, going as far as saying that the threat was sent by a member of Hamas, a Palestinian military group that has featured prominently in the news recently, for completely unrelated reasons.
Hamas denies that they had anything to do with it.
Meanwhile, Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary has expressed his belief that there were KGB agents on board the flight, which Belarus has denied.
In addition, a video was released on May 24th showing Protasevich confessing to the crimes that he was accused of, but many are suspecting that this confession was coerced or even tortured out of him.Many people suspect that he has been rigging elections, as well as using violence to suppress any protests against him.This has led to some countries placing sanctions on or cutting ties with Belarus.The international response to this particular incident has been widespread and intense, with Polish Prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki calling it an “ unprecedented act of state terrorism.
 A joint statement made by 8 countries refers to it asYet another blatant attempt by the Belarusian authorities to silence all opposition voices.The EU recommended that planes avoid flying over Belarus, and both the EU and UK banned Belarusian airlines from their airspace.
In response to this, Russia, who is an ally of Belarus, started rejecting flight plans that avoided Belarusian airspace.
The United States also imposed sanctions on Belarus, on top of issuing a warning asking U.S citizens to avoid traveling to Belarus.As this story develops, it has the potential to be a crucial tipping point.
It adds even more tension between the West, Russia and Belarus.
As investigations continue to reveal details about what actually happened, this tension could increase even further.
If Belarus decides to not release Protasevich, that will increase the tension yet again.
This situation is very delicate, and the way that it plays out over the coming weeks could be very important for people all around the world.DEREK CHAUVIN'S TRIALBY LOUISE GUTBROD '23On May 25, 2020, George Floyd was murdered by Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, who pressed his knee to George Floyd's neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds while Mr. Floyd was handcuffed face down in the street.
It is most likely that by now we all heard about this brutal incident.
It was all over the media and had an impartible effect on the world.
After the video footage went viral it spread like a beacon of light, sparking worldwide protests against racism and excessive use of force by police.
This was only one of the many events in which people of colour were treated with injustice by the American police and will not be the last.
The Black Lives Matter movement of people protesting and giving awareness to a social problem that is carved so deeply into America’s history and is still present in the lives of people of colour every day, was a historical moment.
In cities all over the world, people were kneeling for George Floyd and every black person that was ever placed under injustice.After the emotional racking, Derek Chavin’s trial went on for months, and he was found guilty on three charges: seconddegree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter on the 20th April 2021.
The sensational trial became one of the most closely watched ones in decades.
Some activists claim that justice has been served and that they would feel as if a weight has been taken from their shoulders.It is a milestone in the history of police brutality against black citizens, and the decision is a huge win for activists advocating for policing reform.
For America, a country whose justice system barely keeps police officers accountable for killing on the job, particularly where the victims are Black citizens, the event was a landmark moment.
The conclusion may be seen as an indication that Mr. Floyd's death has shifted the country toward greater responsibility for police abuses and greater equity under the law.
How much will it change?The American police department has been ignoring the problem of racism among their system for centuries and because of one public incident, will it all change?
The answer to this is not easy and change is not guaranteed, but people’s awareness is awakened and they want to change.
A step towards change however is ‘The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, ’ which was passed by the white house on the 3rd March 2021.
It cites Mr. Floyd's legacy as a case to make specific improvements to core police practices, such as prohibiting chokeholds and no-knock warrants, ending qualified immunity for officers, and making it possible to hold police responsible for violations.Nonetheless, sentencing is not spoken yet.
Throughout the emotional trial, both the defence and the prosecution had heavy weighting arguments that influenced the jury and are to be taken into perspective by judging the result of this trial.
The prosecution by Steve Schleicher pleads with the emotions of the jury by portraying moments from George Floyd’s life and describes his struggle under Chauvin's knee.“Imagining a police officer committing a crime might be the most difficult thing you have to set aside because that’s just not the way we think about police officers, ” Mr Schleicher told the 12 jurors who will decide the verdict.
What the defendant did was not policing.
What the defendant did was an assault.On the other hand, The main strategy of Mr Chauvin defence led by the lawyer Eric Nelson was to raise doubts about George Floyds cause of death and to present Chauvin as a “ reasonable officer.
 The defence also stated that one of the most possible ways to appeal is the extensive attention provided to the prosecution that may have swayed the jurors.Throughout the trial, the jury heard from 45 witnesses and saw several hours of surveillance recording.
Eyewitnesses provided some of the most compelling evidence.
Several people sobbed as they watched the gruesome video of the incident and described feeling "helpless" as events unfolded.
Mr. Floyd's three-year partner and his younger brother have testified.
Expert witnesses for the state testified that Mr. Floyd died from a lack of oxygen as a result of the restraint technique used by Chauvin and his colleagues.
A big question during the trial was if Chauvin himself will testify or not.
In the end, Chauvin opted not to testify, citing his right not to incriminate himself with his answers.
Regardless of the try of the defence in the end Derek Chauvil was found guilty and is now in custody awaiting his sentence.
This was one of the first times a white police man was proven guilty for murder during service.
It’s marking a watershading moment, and together with the public awareness, we might bring change to the American Legal System.Human beings make decisions in highly stressful situations that they believe to be right in the very moment it is occurring, ” - Mr NelsonUNPRINCELY PRINCEBY MUSKAN BONINGER '23“If I were reincarnated, I would wish to be returned to earth as a killer virus to lower human population levels.
 His wish came true when his life came to an end.
The Duke of Edinburgh, also known as Prince Philip, died on April 9th at the age of 99, at rather an inconvenient moment.
The Royal Family was accused of racism by Prince Harry's wife, the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Marcle.Can the Duke's death cause more scandal than he has caused alive?
Now that Philip's legacy is being recounted, many people start to notice his comments through another point of view.
He is no longer accompanied by his british humor, because that lies in the ground with the prince, but with racism, sexism, and ignorance.Prince Philip was known to have made comments such as, "I don't think a prostitute is more moral than a wife, but they are doing the same thing. "
People laughed or agreed with this remark.
Now, people actually start to notice that this is a sexist comment, and that a wife is someone more than a woman used for sexual pleasure.Back in 2001, Philip told a boy to “lose weight” if he wished to become an astronaut.lose weight "I don 't think a prostitute is more moral than a wife, but they are doing the same thing.
This was considered a hilarious joke to everyone at the time, but the child’s feelings were definitely hurt.
Since we were toddlers we were taught to not judge and point out anyone.
We were taught to not hurt others’ feelings purposely, yet there he was using his noble title to make cruel comments.Only one year later, the lovely Duke told a 14 year old asian boy that he looked like he was on drugs, after asking who else was on them.
Not only did he make presumptuous comments, but he also told the president of Nigeria that his traditional robe looked like he was “ ready for bed, ” and compared Ethiopian art to "The kind of thing my daughter would bring back from school art lessons.He made racist comments even in China, telling a group of british students in China,During a meeting he said,“If it has got four legs and it is not a chair, if it has got two wings and it flies but is not an aeroplane, and if it swims and it is not a submarine, the Cantonese will eat it.
 Some say this is the unique british humor of the prince while others say this is blunt racism.
If these comments are funny, should we teach our friends to talk like this just to have a humorous moment, or is this just proof of lack of respect and racism in the Prince?
Despite his snarky remarks, he was loved and idealised by his subjects.
He made racist comments even in China, telling a group of british students in China,If you stay here much longer you 'll all be slittyeyed.
I don 't think a prostitute is more moral than a wife, but they are doing the same thing.The duke was called rude, racist, sexist and plain insensitive.
Prince Philip, now deceased, became well known for his long record of inappropriate or awkward gaffes.
A monarch has power, but power means responsibility.
Even if you have no power, even if it's a futile title, it means that certain comments must be filtered, and certain actions must be avoided.
Being married to The Queen of England, makes him someone people look up to, so he should have set examples for others.
Yet, what he taught us was that having “Prince” as a title does not necessarily mean that you act like one, and that his actions never had a consequence.
Those are just the perks of being a Prince of Britain.BIDEN'S FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICEBY SOPHIA LOVALO '22Joe Biden completed his 100th day in office on Wednesday, April 29 and is leading the country in a direction that most Americans are feeling optimistic about.
Considering the severity of the pandemic and the divided political climate of the US when President Biden was inaugurated, critics say has done a rather good job of managing the situation.
Biden made a variety of promises during his campaign, some of which he followed through with and others which are still in the works, but one thing he has done is remain under the radar.
The director for the center of Presidential History at Southern Methodist University described Biden's approach: “People aren't paying that much attention to Biden because he's not doing anything as crazy as the last guy ” .
So, what exactly has Biden been up to these past three months?One of Biden's main priorities seems to be counseling the country through the remainder of the pandemic.
One of his biggest promises was to have 100 million Americans vaccinated by the end of his first one hundred days in office.
This promise was doubled in March to 200 million and is currently considered one of the biggest successes of his presidency thus far.
The seven day rolling average for vaccines given has also heavily increased, starting at 770,000 when Biden took office and now approaching over 3 million.
In addition, as of Biden's 100th day in office over 80% of the senior population has received at least one shot, and 25% of the total American adult population was fully vaccinated.
In relation to the pandemic situation, Biden's 1.9 trillion dollar Covid Relief Bill would probably be considered his greatest achievement.
The bill is referred to as the American Rescue Plan, and aims to dedicate funds to fighting the virus, as well as providing economic relief to many Americans such as stimulus payments and unemployment insurance.
During his presidential address, Biden described his hopes for the Covid 19 situation: “This country will be vaccinated soon, our economy will be on the mend, and our kids will be back in school.
 Though these ideas seem to be realistic, some argue that Biden’s progress regarding the pandemic was bound to happen regardless of who was president.
Though this might be partly true, the steps he has taken, such as increasing vaccine production and vaccine distribution sites have indisputably contributed to significant improvement regarding the health crisis.Biden's second priority seems to be undoing most of the executive orders that were put into place under president Trump.
Among the many controversial actions of his predecessor were a handful of executive orders including a ban on transgender military members, construction of a new boarder wall (separating Mexico from the United States), and the decision to leave the Paris Climate Agreement.
All of these were removed and belong to the forty plus executive orders that Biden has put into place so far.
President Biden was praised for removing many of Trump's most controversial policies, but has also been heavily criticised for the volume of orders.
Tennessee senator Marsha Blackburn, a republican, took to twitter regarding the situation saying, “You can't govern with a pen and a phone, ” but Democrats continue to defend Biden as working to end the burden and suffering that the current health crisis has brought upon Americans.
For the first time in eight years, climate change has finally been made a national priority.
Biden has been described as busy without making much noise, and this definitely applies to his approach towards the climate crisis.
In April, before the mark of his first 100 days in office, Biden committed to his promise of holding a global climate summit among other world leaders.
During the summit, Biden discussed goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the US by 50% by 2030 as part of the Paris Climate agreement which the US rejoined in February of 2021.Biden has had a relatively successful first few months in office, but there are still a few things that the administration is struggling with; one of the most prominent is the immigration problem.
During Trump's time in office, the immigration crisis at the United States Southern Border was one of the most badly handled and controversial situations.
Even under Biden's desire for a more neutral approach, this remains a difficult and prevalent issue.
The Biden administration has yet to make any promising announcements regarding the issue and has asked the American people for patience while they try to find a more humanitarian solution.
Gun violence has been another area of criticism for President Biden.
After a string of mass shootings in the past few weeks this issue has been brought back into the spotlight and remains a highly disputed topic in congress.
Unfortunately, despite some action on this issue, Biden is relying on definitive long term legislation to facilitate the large scale changes, and these remain up to congress and out of his authority.S C I E N C ESPACEX VS. BLUE ORIGIN: THE BILLIONAIRE SPACE RACE COMMENCESBY CARLO VITALE '22The race for the moon has started, and this time it is being fueled by none other than the world’s leading billionaires, each commanding their own company, constantly trying to win over the eyes and attention of NASA.
Elon Musk, founder of companies such as Tesla, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, leads the race with his company known as SpaceX.
SpaceX was founded in 2002 with the plan to turn the United States’ attention to Mars, as well as to create reusable rockets that would lower the cost of space related operations.
It has made various strides in this direction and has even picked up some achievements, such as being the first private company to send an aircraft to the international space station (ISS), along with being the first to send humans to the ISS as well.
On the other side of the ring stands Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.inc, along with his company: Blue Origin.
Similarly to Musk, Blue Origin was founded in the early 2000s with the same goal of making cheaper and reusable rockets.
Although Blue Origin focuses more on the touristic side of space, with their new sightseeing rocket planning to launch on July 20th, they have also been competing with SpaceX’s goal of exploration with their rover called the “Blue Moon” .
Although both companies seem to both be making significant advancements in both of their departments, their competition arises when NASA can only support one of the two companies.
Last year, NASA declared that they would fund one of the new and uprising space exploration related companies to build them a lander to bring astronauts back to the moon.
For the past few months they have been analyzing each company ’s lunar designs and studying them vigorously.
SpaceX proposed adapting a giant rocket named the Starship which would be the one used to travel to Mars as well.
Blue Origin’s proposal was a collaboration of three experienced aerospace companies, to be called the National Team.Towards the end of last month, NASA picked their winner, SpaceX, giving them a 2.9 billion dollar contract for them to carry out their work.
This, as expected, didn’t sit well with the losers of the competition.
Bezos has filed a 50 page protest towards the federal Government Accountability Office challenging the contract given to SpaceX.
Bezos claims that their success shouldn’t be based on jousting for government contracts, along with the claim that NASA made a mistake in picking SpaceX.
Bob Smith, chief-executive of Blue Origin, believes that their proposal was the clear superior of the two and that NASA had to “address their errors” .
Smith also adds that NASA should have stuck to their initial proposal of supporting both companies.NASA had in fact originally planned to support more than one company, as they had put much emphasis on the importance of competition.
In various interviews, NASA representatives have stated that competition is necessary for their success in space as it drives each company to push further beyond and for NASA not to rely on just one source of success.
However, this is far from what is happening today.This is most likely due to Congress only providing them with 850 million dollars, a quarter of what they expected.
Smith also calls out NASA by saying that Blue Origin had placed a much higher bid than SpaceX, but NASA had gone back and renegotiated with SpaceX - an opportunity that none of the other competitors had.
Smith says, “We didn’t get a chance to revise, and that is fundamentally unfair ” .Although the decision might change in the near future, as the Governmental Accountability Office has 100 days to respond to the protest, it seems that SpaceX will come out on top this time.
However, this does not mean that all hope is lost for Blue Origin.
NASA has already declared another competition in which all the losing competitors will have a chance to “ win” and advance their projects.
This will hopefully give Blue Origin the support they need so we can see Musk and Bezos go head to head once again and push each other towards new heights and successes.More articles from this publisher:from'Tuskan Times Volume 9 Issue 5'IS THERE LIFE AFTER DEATH?

Amazon.com boss Jeff Bezos' plan to fund preschools in poor communities puts him in the company of America's richest people who have dedicated some of their wealth to education, a legacy that has long challenged the role of poverty and capitalism in philanthropy.Elaine Thompson/APShare articleRemoveSave to favoritesSave to favoritesPrintEmailFacebookLinkedInTwitterCopy URLSeattleFrom Jeff Bezos’ free preschools to Andrew Carnegie’s public libraries, education stands out as a favorite cause among America’s wealthiest people.And as the rich get richer, and apparently more generous, this legacy of so-called investment philanthropy has shaped government priorities and driven policy changes.
But with such high-profile giving fueled by both capitalism and poverty, critics have thrust that dichotomy into the spotlight, challenging how the system that allowed these philanthropists to amass their fortunes ultimately contributes to the social problems they’re trying to address.Bezos announced this fall he’sdedicating half of his new $2 billion Bezos Day One Fund toward creating free preschoolsin low-income communities nationwide, which could make him the top philanthropic funder of early education.It’s unknown if Bezos considers this seed money or a fixed endowment, but the tech titan, newspaper owner, and space entrepreneur is clear he wants to disrupt the status quo in the same way his Amazon.com company has changed retail, declaring his preschoolers are “the customer.”It marks Bezos’ firmest foray into philanthropy so far, though his representatives declined to comment further.The Amazon founder and CEO in 2018 became the first $100 billion mogul to top Forbes’ annual rankings of the world’s richest people.
Forbes’ calculations overall say the world now has more than 2,200 billionaires with a combined fortune of $9.1 trillion, up 18 percent from the previous year.And that coincides with a record-breaking amount of charitable giving in 2017, according to the annual Giving USA report written by Indiana University.
With $410.02 billion in contributions, the total given to education causes across the U.S. was second only to the amount of money given to churches and religious groups.Larry Lieberman of the nonprofit watchdog Charity Navigator said schools, children, and learning have near-universal appeal among the wealthiest philanthropists, who often credit their own success to the opportunities and power of education.
And much like faith-based organizations, many well-funded educational institutions are dependent on, and therefore masterful at, fundraising.Yet for as long as education philanthropy has existed, so has criticism about one man’s funding priorities and what role capitalism, wealth distribution, and poverty play in it.Fundamentally, philanthropy expert David Callahan said, those philanthropists are also advancing the idea that meritocracy can solve the inequality, without affecting the system of capitalism that produces it.“It’s the myth of the American Dream.
The American Dream is that anyone who can work hard enough and improves themselves will succeed,” Callahan said.
Pretty much everyone buys into it at some level, and a lot of philanthropy reflects it.”America’s leading philanthropists have long favored grander ideas that promise seismic shifts rather than contributing to fixed costs that may better the existing systems of public goods.
While approaches have evolved, high-end philanthropy has been successful in leveraging the might of their private, often tax-exempt dollars to push government investment and policy changes in their pursuits.And whereas some philanthropy amounts to writing blank checks left in presumably capable hands and modestly outlined directives, the wealthiest have personified “venture” or “investment” philanthropy, which hinges on the expectation that the grants prove specific results.Bezos said he’s building a nonprofit organization to open and operate the free preschools,using the teaching philosophy of Maria Montessori.
Bezos himself attended a Montessori school, which generally focuses on individual learning and social-emotional development.Industrialist Andrew Carnegie built libraries where local governments pledged to fund their operations in the 1900s.
The namesake foundation of Sam Walton of the Walmart retail empire has been the largest supporter of privately run, publicly funded charter schools that have become politically polarizing.
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has reigned as the pre-eminent funder for widespread changes in America’s public school systems for more than a decade, deeply influencing policy, advocacy and research over what kids learn and how teachers teach.Including Bezos, all four have been crowned the world’s richest man and spent significantly on education philanthropy.
While Carnegie, the steel tycoon, built physical educational facilities like the libraries, concert hall, and university that still bear his name, Gates as the leader of the computing revolution is known for piloting data-driven school system changes.Carnegie, as the founding father of big-ticket, full-time philanthropy, was already outspoken about giving away his vast wealth by the time he retired from his steel empire.
His manifesto is seen as the prelude to Gates’ “The Giving Pledge,” which urges the rich to give away most of their money.
Bezos hasn’t committed to doing the same.Meanwhile, the low-wage workforce integral to Carnegie’s fortune also bitterly criticized his approach, as he believed “paying” back all of society with learning institutions was a far better use of the profits than allowing individual workers more money for inconsequential personal gains such as more meat and alcohol consumption, said Professor David Nasaw, a Carnegie historian.Parallel to that Carnegie-era criticism, Nasaw said, is the other half of Bezos’ new philanthropy work in combatting homelessness.Bezos in November announced his first set of grants, with $97.5 million in donations to 24 local organizations helping homeless families across the country.
But earlier this year, Bezos’ company as Seattle’s largest private employer intensely fought the city council’s proposed business tax intended to fund more services for the region’s growing homelessness crisis, forcing city leaders to quickly retreat.“Philanthropy is the least democratic institution on earth,” Nasaw said.
It’s rich men deciding what to do.”The Associated PressFollowUnfollowWire ServiceRelated Tags:Foundations/PhilanthropyCopyright 2018 Associated Press.

Here’s How.The Amazon and Blue Origin founder graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with a bachelor's in electrical engineering and computer science.
The rest is history.byAnne DennonAnne DennonRead Full BioWriterAnne Dennon covers higher education trends, policy, and student issues for BestColleges.

But behind his mythic origins is a journey that shows the power of education to inform and inspire.The importance of education was instilled in Bezos from a young age.Bezos was born to a single teen momwho completed high school and later brought her baby along when she attended night classes.
Growing up, Bezos attended publicschools in Texasand Florida.In high school, Bezos worked thebreakfast shift at McDonald'sas a short-order cook.
He was a high-achieving student, becoming aNational Merit Scholarand a member of the honor societyPhi Beta Kappa.Likewise, while still in high school, Bezos participated in the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida.
In hisvaledictorian speech, he talked about colonizing space as a way to save the Earth.Where Did Jeff Bezos Go to College?When Bezos enrolled atPrinceton University, he set out to study space as a physics major.Inspired by Stephen Hawking, he dreamt of becoming a theoretical physicist and ran the Princeton chapter of Students for the Exploration and Development of Space.However, it wasn't long beforeBezos realizedhe would never be at the top of his field in physics.
He wanted to go where he could "make a contribution," so he switched to double majoring inelectrical engineeringand computer science.
Bezos was elected to Tau Beta Pi — the engineering honor society — and graduated in 1986 summa cum laude.Bezos fielded job offers from Intel and Bell Labs, but opted to work for a fintech startup.
After that, Bezos joined a nascent hedge fund experimenting with mathematical modeling.In late 1993, 30-year-old Bezos left his position as a senior vice president of the firm.
He took $300,000 in seed money from his parents, made a cross-country road trip to Seattle, andstarted Amazon.comout of his garage.Bezos never returned to academia, but received an honorary doctorate in science and technology fromCarnegie Mellon Universityin 2008.
A decade later, Bezos was elected to theNational Academy of Engineering.Bezos' Goals Stem From Princeton Physics ProfessorAmazon expanded beyond books to other consumer goods, and then began to grow into increasingly diverse industries.
Once upon a time Amazon nearly went bankrupt, but soonrebounded to twice its former strength.
Today, the tech giant shows no signs of flagging.
Although the average household debt in the U.S. has risen dramatically since early 2020,Bezos' wealth has grownby 70% since the beginning of the pandemic.Amazon's success funds Bezos' real ambitions — the space missions he fixated on as a student but put aside when he switched majors.In 1976, four years before Bezos arrived on campus, Princeton physicist Gerard K. O'Neill published a book detailing plans to move into space — "The High Frontier."
Bezosattended some of O'Neill's seminars.
Through Blue Origin, Bezos' space flight company, he's taking steps toward realizing O'Neill's vision.While Bezos controls huge swathes of e-commerce, book sales, and video streaming, it's his forays into cloud-computing, artificial intelligence, and space travel that receive most of his attention.
In July, Bezos stepped down as CEO of Amazon tofocus on his passions, including his newspaper The Washington Post, prolonging life, and going to space.His last letter to shareholdersquoted geneticist Richard Dawkins: "Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at...
If living things don't actively work to prevent it, they would eventually merge with their surroundings and cease to exist as autonomous beings.
That is what happens when they die.
Bezos recently helped launchAltos Labs, a biotechnology company looking to develop therapy to reprogram aging cells.
Bezos is also a major investor inUnity Biotechnology, a life-extension research firm exploring how to slow or stop aging.Criticized for Business Practices, Bezos Invests in EducationBezos' reputation as aruthless bosshas far-reaching implications that impact the working class on a large scale.
For example, the nonprofit group New Food Economy found that one-third of Amazon workers in Arizona, as well as one-tenth of Amazon workers in Pennsylvania and Ohio,rely on food stamps.In 2018, Senator Bernie Sanders introduced theStop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies(Stop BEZOS) Act, which would have required major employers like Amazon to reimburse the government for the food stamps and other federal benefits that their workers receive.
While president,Donald Trump accused Bezosof sales tax avoidance.Around the same time thatBezos dropped offthe Harvard Business Review's rankings of best-performing CEOs — due to "working conditions and employment policies, data security, and antitrust issues" — Bezos made his first major forays into philanthropy.In January 2018, Bezos made a$33 million donation to TheDream.US, a college scholarship fund for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.

Today, Amazon is an ecommerce behemoth worth $1.8 trillion, and that company has made him the richest person in the world with a fortune worth over$200 billion.Over Bezos' roughly 27 years as CEO, he's regularly shared advice and lessons learned in interviews and his annual letters to Amazon shareholders.Here are some of the best examples of what Bezos, 57, has shared over the years.Take risks"When you think about the things that you will regret when you're 80, they're almost always the things that you did not do.
They're acts of omission.
Very rarely are you going to regret something that you did that failed and didn't work or whatever," Bezos said in a2018 interview.That philosophy helped shape Bezos' life before he even launched Amazon.
When he was just 30 years old, Bezos had a Wall Street job at hedge fund D. E. Shaw, but he saw promise in the future of the internet economy and got the idea to build a bookstore online.
Bezos' boss agreed the idea had potential, but he still tried to convince Bezos that it would be less of a risk to keep the job he had.
I pictured myself [at] 80 years old, thinking back on my life in a quiet moment of reflection," Bezos said of that moment in his life during a2020 fireside chat in India.
Would I regret leaving this company in the middle of the year?
And walking away from my annual bonus?
Of course, Bezos decided to go for it, and he moved across the country to start Amazon out ofa garage in the Seattle suburbsin the summer of 1994.
The website went live a year later, onJuly 16, 1995.
I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing.
And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all,"Bezos saidin 2018.
So he "took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.
Picturing yourself as an 80-year-old looking back on your life and the choices you might regret also works for personal decisions, Bezos added.
I'm not just talking about business things," he said.
It's like, 'I love that person and I never told them,' and you know, 50 years later you're like, 'Why didn't I tell her?
Why didn't I go after it?
So that's the kind of life regret that is very hard to be happy about when you're telling yourself, in a private moment, that story of your life.
VIDEO15:1615:16How I built Blavity, a media empire for Black millennialsMake ItMake good decisions — fastBezos believesthat the key to maintaining an innovative business is to make "high-quality,high-velocitydecisions.
In his2015 letter to Amazon shareholders, Bezos wrote about the importance of speed and "nimbleness" in making Amazon "a large company that's also an invention machine."
While he admits that some decisions are "irreversible or nearly irreversible," most are not.
Most decisions ... are changeable, reversible – they're two-way doors," he wrote.
In those cases, when you make a decision that is "suboptimal," according to Bezos, "you don't have to live with the consequences for that long.
You can reopen the door and go back through.
Those types of decisions should be made "quickly," according to Bezos.
Otherwise, he wrote, people or companies that spend too much time deliberating over reversible decisions risk being subject to "slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention.
All of my best decisions in business and in life have been made with heart, intuition, guts — not [with] analysis,"Bezos saidin an interview at the Economic Club Washington D.C. in 2018.Finding your callingFiguring out your passion in life is a central point in the advice that Bezos says he most often gives to his younger employees, as well as his four children, the billionairesaidat the George W. Bush Presidential Center's Forum on Leadership in 2018.
You can have a job, or you can have a career, or you can have a calling," Bezos said.
And if you can somehow figure out how to have a calling, you have hit the jackpot, because that's the big deal.
In other words, finding a way to make a career out of your passion is Bezos' idea of true success.
And, he believes that everyone has a passion.
You don't choose your passions, your passions choose you," he said at the time.
All of us are gifted with certain passions, and the people who are lucky are the ones who get to follow those things.
While Bezos has said he followed his passion as a "garage inventor" when he launched Amazon, in recent years the billionaire admitted that his real lifelong passion has been space.
Ever since I was 5 years old — that's when Neil Armstrong stepped onto the surface of the moon — I've been passionate about space, rockets, rocket engines, space travel,"he saidin 2019.
Bezos' high school graduation speecheven mentioned his plans to one day build space colonies.
Bezos hasspent billions of dollarsfunding his space company, Blue Origin, and one of his first orders of business after stepping down as Amazon CEO will be to fly on the company'sfirst passenger spaceflightwith his brother on July 20.Embrace the inefficiency of wanderingIn his2018 letter to Amazon shareholders, Bezos included a section titled, "Intuition, curiosity, and the power of wandering."
In that section, the Amazon CEO wrote about the importance of setting aside time to explore your curiosity in order to come up with new, innovative solutions to challenges.Amazon's business may depend on efficiency, with customers ordering almost any product and expecting it delivered to their door within a few days or less.
But, Bezos believes thata healthy dose of inefficiencyis necessary to succeed.
In the letter, he describes this as "wandering," or exploring and experimenting even if it means taking a roundabout path to a solution.
Wandering is an essential counter-balance to efficiency," he said.
You need to employ both.
Sometimes (often actually) in business, you do know where you're going, and when you do, you can be efficient.
Put in place a plan and execute," Bezos wrote in the letter.
In contrast, wandering in business is not efficient … but it's also not random," he continued.
It's guided — by hunch, gut, intuition, curiosity, and powered by a deep conviction that the prize for customers is big enough that it's worth being a little messy and tangential to find our way there.
According to Bezos, one of the lessons he'd learned building Amazon was "that success can come through iteration: invent, launch, reinvent, relaunch, start over, rinse, repeat, again and again," he wrote, adding that "the path to success is anything but straight.
Don't lose your distinctivenessIn April, in hisfinal letter to shareholdersas Amazon's CEO,Bezos wroteabout the importance of holding onto your "originality.
We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable," Bezos wrote.
We are all taught to 'be yourself.'
What I'm really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness.
The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways, it pulls at you.
Don't let it happen.
Bezos went on to say that "it's worth it" to maintain your distinctiveness, even though it requires "continuous hard work.
The fairy tale version of [the advice] 'be yourself' is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine.
That version is misleading.
Being yourself is worth it, but don't expect it to be easy or free," Bezos wrote.Since stepping down as CEO, Bezos transitioned to be executive chairman of Amazon's board and has said he is moving on to focus on projects like Blue Origin.
On Tuesday, July 20,Bezos will even make his first trip to spaceaboard Blue Origin's first-ever passenger spaceflight.Sign up now:Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss:Jeff Bezos steps down as Amazon CEO — look inside the Seattle house where he started the companyValedictorian Jeff Bezos said he wanted to build 'space hotels and colonies' in his 1982 high school graduation speechVIDEO12:0612:06Why more men are becoming stay-at-home dadsMake ItStay in the loopGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inboxSign UpAbout UsLearn more about the world of CNBC Make ItLearn MoreFollow UsCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel©2023CNBC LLC.

We tried all sorts of things ... Mandarin lessons, the Singapore math program, and lots of clubs and sports with other neighborhood kids,"MacKenzie Bezos told Vogue.Learning a second languagehas been found to have educational benefits, and team activities help create well-adjusted kids.
But what exactly is the Singapore math program?Singapore math, also known as the "mastery approach," is a method of teaching mathematics that's most prevalent in Shanghai, China, and Singapore.Under the mastery approach, students learn a specific concept before moving on to more complex ideas, in a rigidly linear progression,Alexei Vernitski, a senior lecturer at the University of Essex,wrote in The Conversation.In Shanghai schools that use the method, students aren't grouped by their perceived intellectual abilities.
Instead, all students perform the same work at the same time before mastering the concept and advancing to the next one together.By contrast, US schools teach math using the "mindset approach," which aims to teach students a more intuitive understanding of math concepts by starting with a broader concept before breaking down a problem into the specific steps for solving.For example, "a mindset-approach teacher can introduce addition via joining two heaps of cardboard counters (or other props) together, explore properties of addition via activities, and only then break the process of adding numbers into procedural steps,"Vernitski wrote.Story continuesA 2015 study of 140 schools in the UK by theUCL Institute of Education and Cambridge Universityfound that the mastery approach improved the speed at which students learned math skills.And on the2015 PISA— a worldwide exam that tests 15-year-olds' math, science, and reading skills — Singapore was the top-performing country in each subject.NOW WATCH:How Lyft's president went from taking no salary for 3 years to running a giant startup worth $11 billionSee Also:The Air Force's 'rods from god' could hit with the force of a nuclear weapon — with no falloutHow your tax bracket could change under Trump's tax plan, in one chartInside the mind of world's richest man and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who hates multitasking and had a unique method for choosing a wifeSEE ALSO:Billionaires and royals are rushing to teach their kids MandarinRecommended StoriesSheKnowsDonald Trump Reportedly Made This Very Specific Plea to Melania Following His ArrestDonald Trump needs some help, and he doesn’t want to do it alone.

They’ve got an X-factor that sets them apart from the general population.
In search of that X-factor, we look everywhere.
We analyze their morning routines.
We marvel at how much (or, more often, how little) they sleep.
We get confused when we find out they like to eat ice cream sundaes for breakfast.To put a unique spin on a familiar saying—most successful people eat just like the rest of us: one bite at a time.
There’s one thing most of them have in common, though: they’re laser-focused on health.
How each person defines a good diet, though, can vary wildly.
Some eat fruits and veggies, others subsist on Utz potato sticks.
We took a quick look at the eating habit landscape among the most successful businesspeople in recent history.
Here’s what we learned.1.
Power to the veggiesSteve Jobs wasknown for his tendencyto eat one food for weeks at a time—causing the Apple visionary’s skin to develop an orange tint when he was on a carrot streak.
The late CEO also experimented with “fruitarianism,” an extreme vegan diet that consisted of fruits, nuts, seeds, vegetables, and grains.
Jobs was also known to fast, believing it would bring him feelings of euphoria and ecstasy, though this may have been a result of his body being deprived of glucose.Sir Richard Branson sayshe balances his partying with plenty of fresh fruit and veggies—and he doesn’t smoke.
In 2014, the 60-year-old billionaire entrepreneur cut beef out of his diet, saying that “eating less red meat can be healthier, better for the environment and … really easy to do.” Since the Virgin Atlantic founder has changed his diet, he’s said that hefeels healthier and more active.2.
It’s all about balance.Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, isnot a morning person—so he has a leisurely breakfast with his wife and children every morning.
He also highly recommends getting a full night’s sleep.Like Bezos, Arianna Huffington also encourages getting a full eight hours of sleep.
The media mogul keeps her eatinghabits simple and veggie-focused, though she’s admitted to skipping breakfast more often than not.
She prefers simple grilled fish and vegetables, and gave up refined sugar years ago—and she’s said she doesn’t miss it at all.
Huffington rarely drinks alcohol other than an occasional glass of sommelier-recommended red wine.
Her cheat food?
Cheese, cappuccino, and “the occasional fabulous dessert.”3.
Quality food is the futureIn 2011,Mark Zuckerberg challenged himselfto eat only animals that he killed himself.
Because this was such a challenge for the Facebook entrepreneur, he said that he “basically became a vegetarian … I’m eating a lot healthier foods and I’ve learned a lot about sustainable farming and raising of animals.” He’s since moved away from this hunter-gatherer mentality.In 2013, Bill Gates invested a substantial amount of money invegan-friendly products.
While the Microsoft founder isn’t a vegan himself, he believes in the potential of alternatives and supports sustainable farming and food production.4.
Eat to stay young at heartWarren Buffett self-describes his diet asthat of a six-year-old.
The legendary business tycoon is a fan of Original and Cherry Coke (he drinks at least five cans a day), enjoys ice cream for breakfast, and is an avid lover of Utz potato sticks.
Nutritionists would probably agree that Buffett fans should take his investment advice rather than follow in his diet footsteps.
When the 84-year-old was asked to explain his high-sugar, high-salt diet, he reportedly said that “the lowest death rate is among six-year-olds.
So I decided to eat like a six-year-old.”5.
Be particularly preciseHoward Hughes is known for his eccentric personality, whether he was obsessing over the size of peas at dinnertime, or on a strict chocolate and chicken diet.
The business tycoon and aircraft engineer was also a total germophobe, probably stemming from his OCD.
Whenever he needed a spoon, it had to bewrapped in tissue papersealed with cellophane, and then wrapped in tissue paper again.
He kept an unusually strict menu, which consisted of a medium-rare butterfly steak with 12 peas of the same size.
If the peas were mismatched, he’d refuse to eat them.Looking for the best of something?

Jobs also would fast for periods of time, sometimes weeks or days, and he stuck to these eating patterns even while his health began to decline, according to Walter Isaacson's biography, "Steve Jobs.
Kutcher said Jobs was interested in the "healing properties" of fruit, and according to Isaacson's book, the Apple co-founder was turned on to the fruit diet in college after reading the book "Mucusless Diet Healing System" by Arnold Ehret.Sometimes, Jobs would stick to eating a few specific fruits at a time, such as apples and carrots, according to Isaacson's book.
Kutcher heard that Jobs drank a lot of Odwalla carrot juice, specifically, even to the point where his skin developed an orange hue.
And Isaacson writes that Jobs stocked the Macintosh offices with Odwalla organic orange and carrot juices.
Odwalla did not respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.
So, I started just drinking carrot juice nonstop all day long," Kutcher told "Hot Ones.
Then one night, Kutcher felt a shooting pain in his back, and had to go to the hospital.
He says he was diagnosed withpancreatitis, which is inflammation of the pancreas, and put on a pain killer medication.
My pancreas was like crazy out of whack," Kutcher said.
The pancreas is a gland that's responsible for controlling blood glucose levels, plus releasing insulin and other enzymes that help with the digestion of food.
Then I'm getting freaked out like, 'Oh my god I've become Steve Jobs.'"
Jobsdied of pancreatic cancerin 2011,but eating excessive amounts of fruit does not cause pancreatic cancer.
While fruit contains vitamins, nutrients and antioxidants that arebeneficial for your health, experts warn against such restrictive diets — a diet of only fruit can putindividuals at risk for nutrient deficiencies, such as essential fatty acids, as well as vitamin and minerals, Jeannine B.
Mills, board-certified dietitian in oncology nutrition and member of the scientific and medical advisory board for thePancreatic Cancer Action Network, tellsCNBC Make It.
This can lead to an array of health consequences, she adds.
And an "overabundance of certain micronutrients from a concentrated intake of a select few foods" can lead to toxicity, she says.It's unclear why Kutcher got pancreatitis, and other important lifestyle factors beyond diet that can impact a person's health, such as medications and underlying health conditions, Mills says.
She advises against going on any sort of self-imposed diet without first discussing it with your doctor and a registered dietitian.While it's been years since Jobs died, and the biopic premiered, fruitarianism has maintained its popularity among people in the vegan community.But Kutcher has some advice from his experience: "Don't drink too much carrot juice," Kutcher said.
That's the moral of the story.

The book, called"Amazon Jeff's Big Discovery,"tells the story of a deer named Jeff who lives in the rainforest.
He wants to find a new challenge, and becomes a postman delivering packages to the forest.
The book is told in rhymes, and ends with a message about both Jeff the deer and Jeff the billionaire Amazon founder:"Ever since, everyone in the forest knows,Packages delivered as quick as Jeff goes!
Shapira told Business Insider that he wrote the book for the "joy of young children's self-discovery."
Shapira sees Bezos as someone for children to emulate, and he wrote in an email that his book is aimed at helping kids "become great achievers and also find their true ability, just like the people of our generation admire pioneers such as the richest living man on the planet, Jeff Bezos of Amazon."
Bezos isworth nearly $109 billion, even after hisdivorcefrom MacKenzie Bezos last year.Bill Gatessurpassed him in November, becoming the richest person with a net worth of $110 billion.Jeff's Big DiscoveryShapira told Business Insider about his inspiration for writing this book.

He wrote that his dream is to inspire children "to dare to dream big without being afraid to fail, to give them the opportunity of self-discovery and self-fulfilment.
When he was first writing the book, Shapira said that he actually wasn't thinking of Bezos, he was just trying to write a story about searching for meaning in life.
Near the end of the writing process, he realized his story fit "like a glove to Jeff Bezos - The man who left his stable job at the '90s for an adventure of delivering books to people which ended by being the most successful entrepreneur of our times.

There’s not enough organic food produced.
After buying Whole Foods, Amazon’s (AMZN) Jeff Bezos may have to fix thatThe A.V.

And withhis purchase of Whole Foods Marketearlier this month, he’ll have even more reason to try and convince US farmers to join him.The meteoric growth of Whole Foods over the last several decades has been a testament to the growing popularity of natural and organic foods in America.
The Organic Trade Association estimates those foods now account for 5% of total food sales, or $47 billion.
That’s still a tiny sliver of food sales.
But even before the Amazon acquisition, people in the industry were saying that number wouldjump to about 10%in coming years.
Now that Amazon—with a much broader consumer base than Whole Foods—has officially picked up the natural-and organic-foods mantle, previous growth estimates might actually be conservative.AdvertisementBut there’s a problem for Bezos if he wants to make organic food as ubiquitous as an Amazon-branded delivery box.
As demand for organic fruits and vegetables has grown, the number of acres used to farm those crops has remained about the same.One of the reasons is that it’s particularly onerous for farmers to switch from conventional farming techniques to organic.
The government requires they create a three-year plan for how they will transition to accommodate more rigorous standards.
The idea is that it takes about three years for conventional soil to contain the nutrient levels needed for organic certification.
Organic crops must be rotated, and farmers must follow stricter standards for pest management and erosion control, among other things.During that three-year transition period, farmers essentially go through the motions required for growing organic foods, but they have to sell it as conventional food at conventional prices.
But if Amazon manages to give more people cheaper access to organic foods, there will be an incentive to push more farmers to go through that process, says Maggie Monast, a sustainable sourcing expert at the Environmental Defense Fund.Advertisement“Most people have computers but they might not have access to a Whole Foods,” Monast tells Quartz.
But if this acquisition does increase demand for organic, there will be serious challenges in terms of scaling up.”For now, the US has relied on importing organic vegetables and fruits from other countries to make up the difference—something some expertsremain dubious about(paywall) when there are instances of imports of so-called organic corn and soy from China, for example, that have been found to be fraudulent.Can Bezos overcome the challenges of producing more organic food the way that he overcame the books trade and then pretty much every bricks-and-mortar retailer?

Although, the original design, essentially a modified trumpet, is not the same as what we have today.At that time, it had another name, the sackbut.
Unlike the modern trombone, the sackbut had a narrower bore and a much smaller flare.It also lacks a water key, bell curve tuning slide, and slide lock.Although both musical instruments are similar, you can’t play the traditional sackbut repertoire on the modern trombone.The first time a trombone was played publicly was at a wedding.In 1468, the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, married Princess Margaret of England.During the banquet, they had the musicians dress up asanimals.
The trombone player dressed up as a he-goat!Beethoven changed the fate of the trombone.Churches, military bands, and the courts of aristocrats were the only places you could hear the trombone in the early 18th century.
It was mainly reserved for serious occasions but rarely for secular events.Composers of that era saw the trombone as a sacred instrument and treated it as such.
That’s untilBeethovenchanged the narrative.He included the trombone in a secular symphony,Symphony No.
5 in C minor,Op.
67 (Fate), for the first time in 1808.Other times Beethoven used the trombone includeSymphony No.
9 in D minor,Op.
125 “(The Choral)andSymphony No.
6 in F major,Op.
68″ (Pastoral Symphony).Therefore, the trombone took center stage in the 19th century thanks to his influence.The trombone is sometimes called “the voice of God.”Beethoven and other composers frequently refer to the trombone as the voice of God because of its perfect tone.Carlos Chavez, a 20th-century South American composer, said the trombone exerted significant influence over the entire orchestra.The trombone can sing like a human.The trombone has an incredible range similar to the human voice.Even now, modern composers highlight this similarity to the human voice.
To achieve this effect, they may use a plunger mite in Jazz.Want to hear it yourself?
Check out thePeanutscartoon series.
The “Wah-Wah” sounds from adults, such as Charlie’s parents and teachers, in the series were made using a trombone.The trombone isn’t left-hand friendly.Left-handed trombonists have to play the trombone the same way as their right-handed counterparts.
While it may not be easy initially, it gets better with practice.Some left-handed trombone players may place it over their right shoulder to move the slide with their left hand.It may look a little awkward if you’ve never seen it done before.
Ever seen someone play the trombone left-handed?Jazz trombonist Locksley Wellington (Slide) Hampton did.
He was right-handed but played with his left hand because his first trombone was configured for left-handed play.Its name is derived from Italian.The word trombone originated from the 18th-century Italian word for trumpet, Tromba.The suffix “-one” means large.
Therefore the word trombone directly translates to large trumpet.It’s the only brass instrument with a slide.Brass instruments, such as the tuba, French horn, and cornet, have one thing in common – valves.You press them down for a new pitch on the instrument.
Not the trombone, however.Instead of valves, it has a seven-position slide.
Sliding from one position to the next changes its pitch.The oldest surviving trombone is roughly 472 years old.The Schnitzer family was one of the most respected makers of musical instruments of the 16th century.Its family members were musicians and made several instruments, such as trumpets and trombones.The Germanisches National Museum in Nuremberg contains tenor trombones by Erasmus Schnitzer from 1551.Trombones can be pricey.Modern plastic trombones come in all colors and wouldn’t leave you with a dent in your pocket.
In general, you can pick one up for around $100 – 200.On the other hand, high-end musical instruments may cost you a pretty penny, and you could easily pay over $10,000 for one.Well, some may say it’s the price you pay if you’re after outstanding craftsmanship!The trombone’s known for its unique way of standing out in a band.
It adds that flair to any song that it’s a part of.It’s a versatile musical instrument that fits anywhere, including bands and orchestras.The brass instrument, often regarded as the backbone of the marching band, deserves all the love it gets.Load MoreShare This10 SourcesWill KimballThe Open UniversityVenturedBritannicaYamahaJazzProfilesLysatorHistoric Brass SocietyDigital TrendsOnline Etymology DictionaryPrevious Article15 Notable Facts About UtahNext ArticleWhy Do We Eat Cake On Our Birthdays?Related Posts5 Underrated Facts About The Triangle InstrumentTop 10 Unusual Ukulele Facts5 Booming Facts About Bongo Drums5 Facts About Wind ChimesAbout The AuthorJennifer AnyabuineJennifer Anyabuine is a med student and freelance writer.

I helped fix windmills, vaccinate cattle, and do other chores.
We also watched soap operas every afternoon, especially "Days of our Lives."
My grandparents belonged to a Caravan Club, a group of Airstream trailer owners who travel together around the U.S. and Canada.
And every few summers, we'd join the caravan.
We'd hitch up the Airstream trailer to my grandfather's car, and off we'd go, in a line with 300 other Airstream adventurers.
I loved and worshipped my grandparents and I really looked forward to these trips.
On one particular trip, I was about 10 years old.
I was rolling around in the big bench seat in the back of the car.
My grandfather was driving.
And my grandmother had the passenger seat.
She smoked throughout these trips, and I hated the smell.At that age, I'd take any excuse to make estimates and do minor arithmetic.
I'd calculate our gas mileage -- figure out useless statistics on things like grocery spending.
I'd been hearing an ad campaign about smoking.
I can't remember the details, but basically the ad said, every puff of a cigarette takes some number of minutes off of your life: I think it might have been two minutes per puff.
At any rate, I decided to do the math for my grandmother.
I estimated the number of cigarettes per days, estimated the number of puffs per cigarette and so on.
When I was satisfied that I'd come up with a reasonable number, I poked my head into the front of the car, tapped my grandmother on the shoulder, and proudly proclaimed, "At two minutes per puff, you've taken nine years off your life!
I have a vivid memory of what happened, and it was not what I expected.
I expected to be applauded for my cleverness and arithmetic skills.
Jeff, you're so smart.
You had to have made some tricky estimates, figure out the number of minutes in a year and do some division."
That's not what happened.
Instead, my grandmother burst into tears.
I sat in the backseat and did not know what to do.
While my grandmother sat crying, my grandfather, who had been driving in silence, pulled over onto the shoulder of the highway.
He got out of the car and came around and opened my door and waited for me to follow.
Was I in trouble?
My grandfather was a highly intelligent, quiet man.
He had never said a harsh word to me, and maybe this was to be the first time?
Or maybe he would ask that I get back in the car and apologize to my grandmother.
I had no experience in this realm with my grandparents and no way to gauge what the consequences might be.
We stopped beside the trailer.
My grandfather looked at me, and after a bit of silence, he gently and calmly said, "Jeff, one day you'll understand that it's harder to be kind than clever.
What I want to talk to you about today is the difference between gifts and choices.
Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice.
Gifts are easy -- they're given after all.
Choices can be hard.
You can seduce yourself with your gifts if you're not careful, and if you do, it'll probably be to the detriment of your choices.This is a group with many gifts.
I'm sure one of your gifts is the gift of a smart and capable brain.
I'm confident that's the case because admission is competitive and if there weren't some signs that you're clever, the dean of admission wouldn't have let you in.Your smarts will come in handy because you will travel in a land of marvels.
We humans -- plodding as we are -- will astonish ourselves.
We'll invent ways to generate clean energy and a lot of it.
Atom by atom, we'll assemble tiny machines that will enter cell walls and make repairs.
This month comes the extraordinary but also inevitable news that we've synthesized life.
In the coming years, we'll not only synthesize it, but we'll engineer it to specifications.
I believe you'll even see us understand the human brain.
Jules Verne, Mark Twain, Galileo, Newton -- all the curious from the ages would have wanted to be alive most of all right now.
As a civilization, we will have so many gifts, just as you as individuals have so many individual gifts as you sit before me.How will you use these gifts?
And will you take pride in your gifts or pride in your choices?I got the idea to start Amazon 16 years ago.
I came across the fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year.
I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles -- something that simply couldn't exist in the physical world -- was very exciting to me.
I had just turned 30 years old, and I'd been married for a year.
I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go do this crazy thing that probably wouldn't work since most startups don't, and I wasn't sure what would happen after that.
MacKenzie (also a Princeton grad and sitting here in the second row) told me I should go for it.
As a young boy, I'd been a garage inventor.
I'd invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker that didn't work very well out of an umbrella and tinfoil, baking-pan alarms to entrap my siblings.
I'd always wanted to be an inventor, and she wanted me to follow my passion.I was working at a financial firm in New York City with a bunch of very smart people, and I had a brilliant boss that I much admired.
I went to my boss and told him I wanted to start a company selling books on the Internet.
He took me on a long walk in Central Park, listened carefully to me, and finally said, "That sounds like a really good idea, but it would be an even better idea for someone who didn't already have a good job."
That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision.
Seen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot.
I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing.
And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all.
After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.Tomorrow, in a very real sense, your life -- the life you author from scratch on your own -- begins.How will you use your gifts?
What choices will you make?Will inertia be your guide, or will you follow your passions?Will you follow dogma, or will you be original?Will you choose a life of ease, or a life of service and adventure?Will you wilt under criticism, or will you follow your convictions?Will you bluff it out when you're wrong, or will you apologize?Will you guard your heart against rejection, or will you act when you fall in love?Will you play it safe, or will you be a little bit swashbuckling?When it's tough, will you give up, or will you be relentless?Will you be a cynic, or will you be a builder?Will you be clever at the expense of others, or will you be kind?I will hazard a prediction.
When you are 80 years old, and in a quiet moment of reflection narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your life story, the telling that will be most compact and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made.
In the end, we are our choices.
Build yourself a great story.

He would, however, be a lot less rich – today, the average salary for a software programmer is around $92,000 per year, according to Glassdoor.Bill GatesNet worth:$112.1 billionWhat he studied:pre-lawGates attended Harvard University for two years before hedropped outin 1975to co-found Microsoftwith classmate Paul Allen.
While at Harvard, he studied law, but alsoenrolled inmathematics and graduate level computer science courses.Thirty years after dropping out, Harvard awarded Gates withan honorary law degree.However, if he were to enroll now, Gates said he would study adifferent subject: "I would go into software, which today that means going into artificial intelligence," he said duringa Q&A with Harvard studentsin 2018.Gates has alsorecommendedstudyingscience, engineering and economics during a2016 interviewwith LinkedIn editor in chiefDaniel Roth.Mark CubanNet worth:$4.1 billionWhat he studied:management and administrationMark Cuban on ABC's "Shark Tank"Jessica BrooksAfter attendingnight classesat the University of Pittsburgh during his junior year of high school, Mark Cuban was able to graduate a year early, according to podcast "Your Turn with Corby Davidson," and start his freshman year at the University of Pittsburgh at 17.After a year, Cuban transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington, because it had thecheapesttuition among the top 10 business programs at the time.
Cubangraduatedfrom its Kelley School of Business with a bachelor's degree in management and administration.Although Cuban supports getting a college degree, "I am not a fanof getting MBAs," he said at aTurning Point USA eventin 2018.
There are so many online ways to learn and I think you can get far more experience in the workforce and learn more and be in a better position to succeed," he said.
T]here are so many online MBA equivalents that if you are disciplined enough, you can do it for a lot less money and still get a quality education.
Sara BlakelyNet worth:$1.1 billionWhat she studied:legal communicationsSpanx founder and CEO Sara Blakely studied legal communications at Florida State University.After receiving her bachelor's degree in 1993, Blakely wanted tofollow in her father's footstepsand become a trial attorney — but things didn't go as planned.
Blakely took the LSAT exam twice but scored poorly both times, despite studying her "a-- off," according to"Getting There: A Book of Mentors.
Warren BuffettNet worth:$89.8 billionWhat he studied:business administration and economicsWarren Buffett originally enrolled at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania at age 16 and studied business, but he transferred to the University of Nebraska to finish his undergraduate degree in three years.
Ididn't want to goto college," Buffetttold Bloombergin 2016.
After the first year [at Wharton] I wanted to quit and go into business.
My dad said, 'Well, give it one more year.'
So I went the second year, and I said 'I still want to quit.
Buffett graduated and has spoken highly of his time at Nebraska:″[T]here wasn't a class that disappointed me," he said in a 2001 article inNebraska Business magazine.After beingrejectedby Harvard Business School,Buffett attendedColumbia Universityand received a master's degree in economics.
If you are interested in business, or likely to be in business, an MBA is very useful," he said in 2001.Ray DalioNet worth:$18.7 billionWhat he studied:accountingBefore founding Bridgewater Associates, theworld's largest hedge fund, Dalio attended Long Island University and studied accounting.
He then received his master's in business administration from Harvard Business School in 1973.But his advice for college students isn't all about what to study: "Party like crazy and don't make the grades your highest priority," Dalio said onRedditin 2019.
Make the friendships and your experiences most important.
Mark ZuckerbergNet worth:$77.6 billionWhat he studied:computer science and psychologyZuckerberg studied computer science and psychology at Harvard University beforedropping outto pursue Facebook.And the CEO had an interest in computers from an early age.
At around 12-years-old, Zuckerberg codedZucknet,a messaging program for his father's dental office, he said onthe Masters of Scalepodcast in 2017.As a high school student at the Phillips Exeter Academy, Zuckerberg and his friend, Adam D'Angelo, createdSynapse, an MP3 player "that would keep track of every song the user played on a computer" and make targeted playlists, according to The Harvard Crimson.Huge companies, including Microsoft, wanted to buy the online MP3 player, but Zuckerberg and D'Angelo declined.
The two wanted to go to college.Oprah WinfreyNet worth:$2.7 billionWhat she studied:speech communications and performing artsWinfrey earned afull scholarshipto Tennessee State University, where she studied speech communications and performing arts before graduating in 1986.Winfrey's advice to other graduates is that "the truth is, success is a process," and life is about making decisions, she said in a commencement speech to theColorado College Class of 2019in May.She also advised graduates to get a job that"pays your rent.
You do need a job.
And may I say,it doesn't have to be your life's mission, or your greatest passion, but a job that pays your rent and lets you move out of your parents house — because yes, they are tired of taking care of you, and they're hoping this education will pay off," she said.
And it will in ways that you can't imagine.

                                  as well as other partner offers and accept ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy.Jeff Bezos may be the richest person in the world, but that doesn't necessarily mean everyone in the world knows who he is.Bezos made a surprise appearance on Monday in a computer-science class at a high school in Washington, DC.
The class is offered thanks to Amazon'sFuture Engineer program, which funds thousands of computer-science courses around the country.According to the Washingtonian, the class was hosting a public event to showcase what students have been able to do with Amazon's help.
A few Amazon programmers were there to mentor students, and a gaggle of reporters were taking photos.Then Bezos himself walked in.
His entrancewas captured in a videofrom NBC Washington's Caroline Tucker.Tucker's video is noteworthy not because of Bezos but because of the students in the class.
As Bezos chats with the teacher, a student in the forefront of the video turns around in his seat to ask the person behind him — perhaps another student, or one of the reporters gathered in the room — about the man in front.The student is clearly seen saying, twice, "Who's Jeff Bezos?
When the person tells the student that Bezos is the CEO of Amazon, the student's reaction suggests he's less than impressed.
Take a look at the video for yourself:—Caroline Tucker  (@CTuckerNews)October 21, 2019The Washingtonian said the class' teacher, Ramona Hutchins, estimated that only about three of her 15 or so students recognized Bezos.The CEOs of tech companies don't have the same instant recognition of celebrities and other public figures.
In a2016 Morning Consult survey, people were asked about their opinions of various tech CEOs, and about half said they hadn't heard of Bezos or had no opinion of him.
That put him behind Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (31%) and Apple CEO Tim Cook (44%) but ahead of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella (59%).Sign up for notifications from Insider!

At least that's what Bezos thought as a college student.Before Bezos ever sold a single book online, he was a physics major at Princeton University in the 1980s.
And despite being one of the top 25 students in his honors program, Bezos believed he wasn't smart enough to compete.So he changed his major to electrical engineering and computer science, according toWired, and it changed the course of his life.
I looked around the room and it was clear to me that there were three people in the class who were much, much better at [physics] than I was, and it was much, much easier for them," Bezos told Wired in 1999.
It was really sort of a startling insight, that there were these people whose brains were wired differently," he said.Bezos had this epiphany after unsuccessfully struggling to solve a math problem for hours.
I can't solve this partial differential equation," he told theEconomic Club of Washingtonin September 2018.
It's really really hard.
I'm studying with my roommate, Joe, who is also really good at math.
The two of us worked on this one homework problem for three hours and got nowhere.
He and his roommate finally asked a friend, Yasantha Rajakarunanayake, for help.
We show him this problem, and he looks at it, stares at it for a while, and says 'Cosine, that's the answer.'
And i'm like 'That's the answer?'
And he's like 'Yes, let me show you,'" Bezos said.
He brings us into his room, he sits us down, he writes out three pages of detailed algebra, everything crosses out, and the answer is cosine.
I said, 'Did you just do that in your head?'
And he said, 'No, that would be impossible.
Three years ago, I solved a very similar problem.
I was able to map this problem onto that problem, and then it was immediately obvious that the answer was cosine.
According to Bezos, that was the moment he realized he should pursue a different career.
That was an important moment for me, because that was the very moment when I realized I was never going to be a great theoretical physicist," he said at the Economic Club.
I started doing some soul searching.
In most occupations, if you're in the 90th percentile, you're going to contribute.
In theoretical physics, you gotta be one of the top 50 people in the world, or you're really not helping out much.
Bezos changed his major and "committed to starting and running his own business," according to Wired.Bezos graduated from Princeton in 1986 with a degree inelectrical engineering and computer science.In 1994 while working at a hedge fund, Bezos found a staggering statistic  theweb was growingat 2,300% per year, which inspired him to launch Amazon as an online bookseller in 1995.
Today the so-called "everything store," has amarket capitalizationof over $1 trillion.
I saw the writing on the wall, and I changed my major very quickly to electrical engineering and computer science," Bezos said at the Economic Club.Like this story?Subscribe to CNBC Make It on YouTube!Don't miss:Jeff Bezos looks for these 3 traits when hiring at AmazonJeff Bezos: This is the one Amazon leadership principle that 'surprises people' the mostThis employee's suggestion to Jeff Bezos doubled Amazon's productivity in its first monthVIDEO1:5001:50Suzy Welch: This simple question from Jeff Bezos changed the way I think about workGet To Work: With Suzy WelchStay in the loopGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inboxSign UpAbout UsLearn more about the world of CNBC Make ItLearn MoreFollow UsCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel©2023CNBC LLC.

Skip to: Start of Article.Author: Geek's Guide to the Galaxy.Geek's Guide to the GalaxyCultureDate of Publication: 01.26.19.01.26.19Time of Publication: 8:50 am.8:50 amHowStarTrekand Sci-Fi Influenced Jeff BezosJeff Bezos named his dog after aStar Trekcharacter.Franziska Krug/Getty ImagesJeff Bezos is a lifelong science fiction fan.
As a child the Amazon founder spent his summers reading Asimov and Heinlein, and according to Christian Davenport, who profiled Bezos in his bookThe Space Barons, he’s a hardcoreStar Trekfan.“He named his dog Kamala, after one of the characters, and one of his holding companies is Zefram LLC, named for the character inStar Trekwho created the warp drive,” Davenport says in Episode 345 of theGeek’s Guide to the Galaxypodcast.
He even had a cameo in one of theStar Trekfilms.
So that’s obviously a huge influence on him.”Podcasthttps://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/geeksguide345final.mp3RSSiTunesDownloadScience fiction also played a role in the creation ofBlue Origin, the rocket company that Bezos founded in 2000.
The year before, Bezos had watched the movieOctober Sky, about NASA engineer Homer Hickam, with science fiction authorNeal Stephenson.
Afterward they were discussing the film.“[Jeff] says to Neal Stephenson, ‘I’ve always wanted to start a rocket company, that’s always been my dream,'” Davenport says.
And Neal Stephenson just said, ‘Do it.
Do it today.’ And soon thereafter, he did.”Despite his busy schedule, Bezos still makes time to read new science fiction from writers such as Alastair Reynolds, Ernest Cline, and Andy Weir.
I got the sense that that’s important to him, to sort of nourish his mind,” Davenport says.
So he definitely tries to keep up on that stuff.”Bezos has also moved to acquire more science fiction for Amazon’s streaming service.
Novels by Iain Banks, Larry Niven, and Neal Stephenson are all in development, and last spring Amazon savedThe Expanseafter it was canceled by Syfy.“Something that [Jeff] wants to do is not just to have success in space—to make rockets that are reusable—but to reinvigorate interest in space,” Davenport says.
And I thought savingThe Expansewas a great way to do that.”Listen to the complete interview with Christian Davenport in Episode 345 ofGeek’s Guide to the Galaxy(above).
And check out some highlights from the discussion below.Christian Davenport on interviewing Jeff Bezos:“What I found in the archives was the press release from when Jeff’s grandfather left ARPA to go back to work at the Atomic Energy Commission, and the press release had a picture of his grandfather on it—a very big picture.
And so I saw him a few months later and handed him the press release, which he had never seen—and I could see the expression on his face—and I just said, ‘I’m putting my cards on the table.
I’m writing this book, and I’m just really trying to impress you with the level of research I’m doing.’ And then I thought I had him, and he said, ‘I’m inclined to participate.’ Then it took another couple of months of working with his people to get on the schedule, but then I did.”Related StoriesGeek's Guide to the GalaxyBeing a Hollywood Science Consultant Isn’t Exactly GlamorousGeek's Guide to the GalaxyDoctorWhoIs Reaching a Whole New AudienceGeek's Guide to the GalaxySci-Fi Writers Are Grappling With a Post-Trump RealityChristian Davenport on the future:“[Jeff] gives this stump speech about how we shouldgo out to space to preserve Earth, and today the line he says is, ‘Earth should be zoned residential,’ that Earth is this really magnificent place, with waterfalls and palm trees and snow and bacon and wine and whiskey, and all these wonderful things, and that other planets—like Mars, for example—which is whereElon Muskwants to go, are really desolate, and hard places to live.
 So that’s what he talks about today, but when he was 18 years old and giving a speech at his high school, it was virtually the same speech, but instead of saying ‘Earth should be zoned residential’ he said ‘Earth should be preserved as a National Park.’ So obviously this is something he’s been thinking about for a very long time.”Christian Davenport on Blue Origin:“[Jeff] turned to me and he said, ‘Do you know how a bullwhip works?’ And I was like, ‘What do you mean?’ And he said, ‘Well, that crack, there’s a mini sonic boom in there.
You can get the whip to go faster than the speed of sound just with your arm, and the way that works is that momentum is mass times velocity, and so as your mass decreases—toward the end of the whip—your velocity has to increase.’ And so I’m digesting that and letting it sink in, and then I’m like, ‘So you were going to bullwhip people into space?’ And he’s like, ‘Well, no, no, no.
Not people.
But maybe satellites or cargo, and things like that.’ But they could see that this was an idea that wasn’t going to work.”Christian Davenport on the space industry:“What I’ve noticed, just in reporting this over the last five years, is how the investment community is becoming more interested in space.
I think early on space investors were the space geeks, they were the enthusiasts, they were more interested in the dream than they were perhaps in the return on investment.
But now you’ve seen more players get into this.
I mean, the fact that Google and Fidelity invested a billion dollars intoSpaceXshould tell you something, and the fact that companies like Morgan Stanley are talking about it.
Whereas they used to say, ‘The quickest way to become a millionaire in space is to start out as a billionaire,’ now I think people are starting to believe that you can actually make money in space.”More Great WIRED StoriesWeedmaps’ grip on the high-flying Californiapot marketHave phones become boring?

He’s loved writing his entire life, from creating picture books when he was seven to learning how to write copy, scripts, audio stories for radio and more in college.
The Hollywood Insider’s dedication to combining deft storytelling and positivity made him realize that this had to be his next step forward.
Some of his hobbies include traveling, tv shows, and movies.
His favorite show is Avatar: The Last Airbender.
As of right now, he’s a charity fundraiser in Cincinnati.Feb 28, 2023Table of ContentsWith a Little Help from His ParentsJeff Bezos is ComplicatedWhat Makes Jeff More Than a SymbolAuthor‘Bezos: the Beginning’is a made-for-television movie now available for streaming onAmazon Primeand Google Play.
It details the rise, trials, and tribulations ofBezos’early life in his attempt to start his now titanic e-commerce company.
We witness Bezos (played byArmando Gutierez) start out as an endearing yet unconfident VP of a hedge fund company, then transition to creating an entirely online startup for purchasing books, then the polishing and repolishing of the idea ofAmazonuntil it bears some semblance of how we know it today.I was surprised that a biopic about his life hadn’t been made yet.
To any given American citizen, Bezos is a wealth of mysteries and secrets.
He represents our current economic system at its most extreme, and is as famous as any other famous tech giant (Bill Gates,Mark Zuckerberg,Jack Dorsey).
Surely someone would have tried to make a film about him in the same vein as‘The Social Network’.
Somehow, not until now.
Overall, it’s a fairly watered-down interpretation of the controversial tech giant’s early life, sticking to the basic facts and not too much more.
The book the movie is based on,‘Jeff Bezos-Zero to Hero’,  provides a fairly neutral if not more positive image of Bezos.
We occasionally see him get into fights with his two other employees, and an increasingly fraught relationship with his (now ex) wifeMacKenzie Scott(played byAlex Mitchell).
Still, there are things that an average person might not know about Jeff Bezos that were explored well in this story.
Like the book, the movie tries to make room for moments that give a more complete and whole picture into who Jeff Bezos was and is as a person.Things to do:Subscribe toThe Hollywood Insider’sYouTube Channel, by clicking here.Limited Time Offer – FREE Subscription toThe Hollywood InsiderClick here to read more onThe Hollywood Insider’svision, values and mission statement here – Media has the responsibility to better our world –The Hollywood Insiderfully focuses on substance and meaningful entertainment, against gossip and scandal, by combining entertainment, education, and philanthropy.With a Little Help from His ParentsOne part of Bezos’ life that adds a lot to who he is that the movie touches on early in the story is the role his parents played in his life and career trajectory.
After Jeff and MacKenzie decide to quit their jobs and begin their start-up, the first thing they do is ask around for loans.
They drive toBezos’ parentshouse, and he asks them for an enormous loan, to which they ultimately agree to the next day.
To say this is generous is an understatement.
It’s an incredible opportunity that his parents give him at this moment, and it’s not baseless either.
The movie notes that Bezos’ parents care deeply about their son, and would do almost anything to help their son succeed.This definitely adds an important layer to Bezos and his life story.
For obvious reasons, the interaction plays a huge part in defining the entrepreneur: namely, his resourcefulness and his luck.
He showed determination in taking the first step by trying to find money, which can be difficult for many reasons.
The scene also becomes a commentary on the nature of what a person may or may not need when starting a business in our country.
Three hundred thousand dollars is an enormous amount, but in terms of getting a business as ambitious as Jeff’s off the ground, it’s probably closer to what it would really take.Related video:EVOLUTION: Every Tom Cruise Role From 1981 to 2021, All Performances Exceptionally PoignantRelated video:EVOLUTION: Every Johnny Depp Role From 1984 to 2020, All Performances Exceptionally PoignantJeff Bezos is ComplicatedOne area this movie succeeded in when it did touch on it was the moodier side of Bezos.
At times, the man comes across as mild-mannered, unwilling to step over other people to achieve his dreams.
However, there are a few instances where a completely different aspect of him comes out.
His relationship with MacKenzie starts out very supportive and without ego, but soon sours as complications pile up.
While he’s kind to his employees’ faces most of the time, it’s also revealed that he’d purposely left out details of the plan he priorly discussed withShel Kaphanthat would’ve helped his career and finances.To be honest, the movie could have expanded a little more on this part of his life.
Some of the most important moments would arguably be Bezos’ early decisions that negatively affected the people around him and their greater implications.
His competitors, his employees, and his wife are occasionally mistreated.
The darker side of Bezos is mainly relegated to the end of the movie, when he tells one of his smartest and hardest-working employees that he should’ve cared about his future more instead of giving the employee the kind of share he had asked for.Related article:MUST WATCH –The Hollywood Insider’sCEO Pritan Ambroase’s Love Letter to Black Lives Matter – VIDEORelated article:Why Queen Elizabeth II Is One Of The Greatest Monarchs | Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of United Queendom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland (Video Insight)Related article:All Best Actor/Actress Speeches From The Beginning Of Oscars 1929-2019 | Hollywood InsiderWhat Makes Jeff More Than a SymbolLast but not least, this movie also attempted to flesh out Bezos’ specific relationships with the people around him.
For instance, one of the most important relationships he has is with his wife, MacKenzie Scott.
MacKenzie worked at the same company he did at the beginning, and both are very ambitious people being spiritually crushed by their mindless hedge fund jobs.
Bezos had a drive to do something more innovative, and MacKenzie was extremely creative with larger writing aspirations.
Another defining relationship Bezos had is with his future competitor and founder of Barnes and Noble,Len Riggio.
Riggio is incredibly skeptical and mocking Bezos’ idea, and this skepticism climaxes to anger when he threatens to sue Bezos over calling his e-commerce store the largest bookstore.The way the movie portrays how Bezos handles these interactions and their increasing hostility and disappointment is one of the most interesting parts of the story, and are defining moments that will shape the rest of his emotional life.
At first, Bezos and his wife give each other grace when they make mistakes.
This is true for his employees as well.
Then, things take downturns when various obstacles come up: when funding is hard to come by, when no one else seems to like the idea, and so on.
Once this stuff starts happening, Bezos struggles to balance the stress with handling his relationships with care.
One helpful way to learn more about a person is how they treat others around them.
How he handles this facet of life in all its complexity gives off a fairly nuanced understanding of Bezos’ strengths and weaknesses as an adult.‘Bezos: the Beginning’ has its moments that make it worth watching.
It delivers on expanding on Bezos’ early personal life, and how it intermingled (for better and for worse) with his professional life.
In doing so, the movie successfully paints Bezos as more than just a character worth studying.
He becomes a real person, with real problems and strengths and neuroses like anyone else.
Bezos: the Beginning’ is out streaming on Amazon Prime, Google Play, Vudu, and as a YouTube rental.Director: Khoa LeaWriters: Allison Burnett, Tashena EbanksCast: Armando Gutierrez, Kevin Sorbo, Alex Mitchell, Sasha AndreevBy Zachary DePioreClick here to readThe Hollywood Insider’sCEO Pritan Ambroase’s love letter to Cinema, TV and Media.
An excerpt from the love letter:The Hollywood Insider’sCEO/editor-in-chiefPritan Ambroaseaffirms,“We have the space and time for all your stories, no matter who/what/where you are.
Media/Cinema/TV have a responsibility to better the world andThe Hollywood Insiderwill continue to do so.Talent, diversity and authenticity matter in Cinema/TV, media and storytelling.
In fact, I reckon that we should announce “talent-diversity-authenticity-storytelling-Cinema-Oscars-Academy-Awards” as synonyms of each other.
We show respect to talent and stories regardless of their skin color, race, gender, sexuality, religion, nationality, etc., thus allowing authenticity into this system just by something as simple as accepting and showing respect to the human species’ factual diversity.
We become greater just by respecting and appreciating talent in all its shapes, sizes, and forms.
Award winners, which includes nominees, must be chosen on the greatness of their talent ALONE.I am sure I am speaking for a multitude of Cinema lovers all over the world when I speak of the following sentiments that this medium of art has blessed me with.
Cinema taught me about our world, at times in English and at times through the beautiful one-inch bar of subtitles.
I learned from the stories in the global movies that we are all alike across all borders.
Remember that one of the best symbols of many great civilizations and their prosperity has been the art they have left behind.
This art can be in the form of paintings, sculptures, architecture, writings, inventions, etc.
For our modern society, Cinema happens to be one of them.
Cinema is more than just a form of entertainment, it is an integral part of society.
I love the world uniting, be it for Cinema, TV, media, art, fashion, sport, etc.
Please keep this going full speed.”More Interesting Stories FromTheHollywood Insider–Want GUARANTEED SUCCESS?

However, it is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team.In an exclusive interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas this weekend, the billionaire businessman was asked if he was seeking to buy the team.“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smirk.Bezos pointed out that he “grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid.”“It is my favorite sport,” he said in the interview.
So we’ll just have to wait and see.”A House Oversight Committee investigating Snyder accused the current Commanders owner of fostering a “toxic workplace” and conducting “a shadow investigation to target his accusers, pin the blame on others, and influence the NFL’s own internal review.” Snyder has denied the accusations but isconsidering a sale of the team.The NFL fined the Commanders $10 million following an internal investigation by attorney Beth Wilkinson last year.Jeff Bezos and Lauren SanchezCNNExclusive: Jeff Bezos says he will give most of his money to charityWhy would Bezos want to own the Commanders?
The team is one of the most notable franchises in one of the most popular sports leagues in the world.
The Commanders have won three Super Bowls (in 1983, 1988 and 1992) and is located in the giant Washington, DC, market.The NFL is the biggest ratings powerhouse on American TV andhas been a hit for Amazon Prime Video, which is the exclusive home to “Thursday Night Football.”Jay Marine, Prime Video’s head of sports, wrote in an internal memo in September that the debut “exceeded all of our expectations for viewership” and led to “the biggest three hours for US Prime sign ups ever in the history of Amazon.”– CNN’s Chloe Melas and David Close contributed to this report.RelatedAd FeedbackMore from CNN BusinessLucy Nicholson/ReutersCommercial real estate is in trouble.

The franchise that has caught Bezos’ eye is reportedly the Washington Commanders.
Bezos owns The Washington Post, so his interest in the Commanders makes sense.When current Washington ownerDaniel Snyder recently hired Bank of America to “explore potential transactions,” the Bezos rumors went into overdrive.Jay Glazer of FOX Sports reported Snyder’s intentionis a complete sale of the franchise.In a recent interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas, Bezos was asked about the buzz of potentially adding NFL owner to his resume.“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said while laughing.
Bezos’ partner, Lauren Sanchez spoke up and said, “I do like football.
I am just going to throw that out there for everyone,” she said.Bezos laughed and offered the following response.“There’s not much I can say about that right now, but she does like football.”Melas then asked Bezos if owning a professional sports team was always a part of his dream.“Well, I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid,” Bezos said.
It is my favorite sport; we’ll just have to wait and see.”After Bezos spoke, Sanchez chimed in again, “Once again, I do like football.”Will@JeffBezosbuy the Washington@Commanders?He was asked about it during a@cnninterview.pic.twitter.com/RDzWMWlNwx— Scott Abraham (@Scott7news)November 14, 2022Bezos is one of the multiple names with a reported interest in the Commanders.
There is a rumored partnership with millionaire music mogul Jay-Z as the two prepare a bid for the Washington NFL franchise.You can say a lot without saying a thing.
And that’s what Bezos did in this interview.
His words — or lack of words —combined with Sanchez’s “love” of football, tell you he plans to make a serious run at buying the Commanders.Story originally appeared on Commanders WireTRENDING1.Kyle Anderson says he and Rudy Gobert have 'hashed it out' after fight during timeout2.NFL Draft hopeful Michael Jefferson seriously injured in fatal Alabama car crash3.

Just in the last year, Amazonacquired Whole Foods, began allowing Amazon Prime membersto watch its movies and TV showson Apple TV,created a camerathat can help you pick out nicer outfits, was granted patents for delivery droneswith wings and legsandmuch more.But back in 1994, when a 30-year-old, newly married Bezos quit his Wall Street job tostart Amazon, the business was pretty simple.
It sold books.
When we opened our doors, we had 10 employees," Bezos tellstechnology blog GeekWire.
I was driving the packages to the post office myself in my 1987 Chevy Blazer and dreaming one day that we might have a forklift.
Only three years later, in 1997,Amazon went publicand Bezos' wealth catapulted to over$12 billion, according to Bloomberg.But you wouldn't have known it by the newly minted billionaire's car.
Despite his windfall, Bezos swapped out his 1987 Chevy Blazer for only a modest upgrade — a Honda Accord.That's according to a profile CBS's Bob Simondid of Bezos in 1999for "60 Minutes," recentlyresurfaced by Geekwire, showing Bezos sporting khakis, a button-down and driving the car.
What's with the Honda?"
Simon asks Bezos.After a laugh, Bezos, who according to The New York Times owned roughly$10 billionin Amazon stock in 1999, responds, "This is a perfectly good car.
During the interview, Simon also discovered Amazon's then-headquarters in Seattle shared a street address withpawn shop, a heroin-needle exchange and a "porno parlor."
And inside, Bezos' desk was made out of a re-purposed wooden door and two-by-four pieces of wood.
In fact, the entire company used desks made of doors as deliberate message,according to the Times.Why so frugal?
It's a symbol of spending money on things that matter to customers and not spending money on things that don't," Bezos explains to Simon.By 2004, Amazon employees werestill using door desks, notes Fast Company.
And in 2013, Bezos was still driving a Honda, though a slightly bigger model, according to Brad Stone's book, "The Everything Store.
Today, Amazon has a $620 billion market cap and reported$43.7 billionin revenue during its third quarter in 2017 alone, a 34 percent increase from the same quarter in 2016.Bezos has somebigger extravagances, like multiple homes, a private jet and Blue Origin.Yet "frugality" remains one of Amazon'score principlesand the company sticks by Bezos' early mentality.
Amazon even gives out an accolade called the "Door Desk Award" to employees who come up with ideas that save money.According to Amazon: "Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention.
