Obama has expressed his passion for music and illustrated that he’s hip to today’s rising talent in many ways, from inviting musical guests to nearly every White House event — his Fourth of July Barbeque, the final White House State Dinner and more — to hosting the first ever South by South Lawn music festival.RelatedPresident Obama Welcomes Common, Leonardo DiCaprio & The Lumineers to His Backyard for Inaugural…10/04/2016On Friday (Oct. 28), Obama called in to share who his favorite rappers are on the radio showSway in the Morning, which airs onEminem‘s SiriusXM channel Shade 45.
When hostSway Callowayasked, “Who are the top rappers in the game, in your opinion?” Obama was quick to reply.“KendrickandChanceare doing amazing work,” he said — two artists who frequent the White House.
Obama also said, “I love Drake, and the girls loveDrake, so he’s commercially just doing great and [is] unbelievably talented.” Obama went on to say he and Chance have been “family for a while,” as he first met the now-famous artist when he was only 8 years old back in Chicago.RelatedChance the Rapper & Frank Ocean Bring Parents to White House State Dinner10/18/2016Elsewhere, Obama mentionedKanyeand “the king”Jay Z, though he said in terms of who’s breaking new ground, “Kendrick and Chance; those guys are doing amazing work and are wonderful young men.”Listen to the full conversation below.Get weekly rundowns straight to your inboxSubscribeRead More AboutObamaSway CallowayWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?Get in the know onVisit Billboard Pro for music business newsTrendingHoward Stern Is ‘Dumbfounded’ Over Kid Rock & Travis Tritt’s TransphobiaTed Nugent Calls Anheuser-Busch’s Dylan Mulvaney Partnership ‘the Epitome of Cultural Deprivation’Dee Snider on Letting Gun Control Advocates Use ‘We’re Not Gonna Take It’: ‘Sometimes You Have to Say Enough is Enough’Millie Bobby Brown Quotes Taylor Swift’s ‘Lover’ Lyrics in Apparent Engagement AnnouncementIam Tongi Delivers ‘Showstopping’ Performance on ‘American Idol’: WatchThe DailyA daily briefing on what matters in the music industryEmail AddressSign UpSign UpBy subscribing, I agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.

Here are some of my favorites,” he wrote on social media (adding, in true Eric Alper Twitter mass-engagement fashion, “Are there any songs or artists I should check out?”).Obama’s list hits some of the biggest releases of the year in wisely disparate genres, including the Latin music of Bad Bunny, with the song “Titi Me Pregunto,” and country, with the blockbuster new artistZach Bryanand his left-field streaming smash “Something in the Orange.”There isn’t a huge amount of overlap between Obama’s picks and the top Grammy nominees, although three of the candidates for record of the year did make the ex-president’s list: “Break My Soul,” “About Damn Time” and Kendrick Lamar’s “The Heart Part 5.”Best new artist Grammy nominee Omar Apollo made it onto Obama’s list with “Tamaoatchi.” Latin music favorite Rosalia, who topped many critics’ year-end lists even though she had a lesser presence than expected in the Grammy nods, was recognized by Obama for her song “Saoko.”Sometimes he went with an artist’s second-biggest hit, as when he favored “Sunshine” by Steve Lacy (featuring Foushee) over Lacy’s bigger breakout smash, “Bad Habit.”View this post on InstagramA post shared by Barack Obama (@barackobama)In the case of Ethel Cain and her “American Teenager,” he picked an artist who picked up some critical acclaim for her debut album, “Preacher’s Daughter,” which deals with heavy subject matter like religion and domestic violence, but whose songs have not charted at all.
Since Cain didn’t make enough of an impression to show up on many critics’ polls, either, Obama’s imprimatur may give her a big boost in visibility.
Haitian-American artist Leyla McCalla, a member of Our Native Daughters, can also count on getting further attention for her under-heard solo album.Sudan Archives’ “Home Maker” might count as nearly as unpredictable a choice, although, in lieu of charting positions, her album was at least being well represented on year-end critics’ lists.
Problem With It” also counts as an extremely deep cut, coming from the little-heard duo Plains, a collaboration between Jess Williamson and Waxahatchee’s Katie Crutchfield.SZA’s “Shirt” is a very of-the-moment pick, from the album that became a No.
1 bestseller upon its mid-December release, although the song itself has been out since October.Obama also publishes a summer playlist, which includes both topical songs and oldies, but only a half-dozen of the artists he included from his mid-year favorites list made it to his end-of-2022 roundup (sorry, Wet Leg and Harry Styles).As always, music fans will be admiring his taste, while wondering how he comes across all his picks.

This bipartisan measure
reauthorizes the 50-year-old Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), the nation’s national education law and longstanding commitment to equal opportunity for all
students.The new law builds on key areas of progress in recent years, made possible by the efforts of educators, communities, parents, and students across the country.For example, today, high school graduation rates are at all-time highs.
Dropout rates are at historic lows.
And more students are going to college than ever before.
These achievements provide a firm foundation for further work to expand educational opportunity and improve student outcomes under ESSA.The previous version of the law, the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, was enacted in 2002.
NCLB represented a significant step forward for our nation’s children in
many respects, particularly as it shined a light on where students were making progress and where they needed additional support, regardless of race, income, zip code,
disability, home language, or background.
The law was scheduled for revision in 2007, and, over time, NCLB’s prescriptive requirements became increasingly unworkable
for schools and educators.
Recognizing this fact, in 2010, the Obama administration joined a call from educators and families to create a better law that focused on the
clear goal of fully preparing all students for success in college and careers.Congress has now responded to that call.The Every Student Succeeds Act reflects many of the priorities of this administration.ESSA HighlightsPresident Obama signs the Every Student Succeeds Act into law on December 10, 2015.ESSA includes provisions that will help to ensure success for students and schools.
Below are just a few.
The law:Advances equity by upholding critical protections for America's disadvantaged and high-need students.Requires—for the first time—that all students in America be taught to high academic standards that will prepare them to succeed in college and careers.Ensures that vital information is provided to educators, families, students, and communities through annual statewide assessments that measure students'
progress toward those high standards.Helps to support and grow local innovations—including evidence-based and place-based interventions developed by local leaders and educators—consistent with
ourInvesting in InnovationandPromise NeighborhoodsSustains and expands this administration's historic investments in increasing access to high-qualitypreschool.Maintains an expectation that there will be accountability and action to effect positive change in our lowest-performing schools, where groups of students
are not making progress, and where graduation rates are low over extended periods of time.History of ESEAThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was signed into law in 1965 by President Lyndon Baines Johnson, who believed that "full educational opportunity"
should be "our first national goal."
From its inception, ESEA was a civil rights law.ESEA offered new grants to districts serving low-income students, federal grants for textbooks and library books, funding for special education centers, and
scholarships for low-income college students.
Additionally, the law provided federal grants to state educational agencies to improve the quality of elementary and
secondary education.NCLB and AccountabilityNCLB put in place measures that exposed achievement gaps among traditionally underserved students and their peers and spurred an important national dialogue on
education improvement.
This focus on accountability has been critical in ensuring a quality education for all children, yet also revealed challenges in the effective
implementation of this goal.Parents, educators, and elected officials across the country recognized that a strong, updated law was necessary to expand opportunity to all students; support
schools, teachers, and principals; and to strengthen our education system and economy.In 2012, the Obama administration began granting flexibility to states regarding specific requirements of NCLB in exchange for rigorous and comprehensive state-
developed plans designed to close achievement gaps, increase equity, improve the quality of instruction, and increase outcomes for all students.What's Next?Over the next few weeks, the U.S. Department of Education will work with states and districts to begin implementing the new law.

Inauguration day temperature: Can Obama keep warmer weather pledge?

Will he — or Mother Nature — deliver?It’s looking like an uncomfortably close call — the emphasis on the word uncomfortable for people who will be outside on what’s predicted to be a downright chilly day.In September, campaigning in Colorado, Obama was talking to a potential voter who mentioned he had been one of the hundreds of thousands of people outdoors at Obama’s bone-chilling first inaugural when the noontime temperature was an unseasonable chilly 28 degrees.
Obama promised: “This one is going to be warmer.”Scientifically, the president doesn’t have control of day-to-day weather.
While his policies can lessen or worsen future projected global warming on a large scale, they cannot do anything about Washington’s daily temperature on Jan. 21.Still, it’s a promise that for a long time looked close to a sure thing.
The history of local weather was on Obama’s side.
On average, the normal high is 43 degrees and the normal low is 28 but that’s just around dawn.
There have been 19 traditional January inaugurations and only two were colder: Ronald Reagan’s second in 1985 was a frigid 7 with subzero wind chills and John F. Kennedy’s in 1961 was a snowy 22.
Jimmy Carter’s 1977 inauguration also was 28.And then there was the general warming trend Washington had been stuck in.
The last time the nation’s capital stayed below freezing all day was Jan. 22, 2011.
The city has gone a record more than 700 days since it had two or more inches of snow.So a dozen days before Inauguration Day, when asked if it this inauguration would be warmer than in 2009, Mike Halpert, deputy director of the federal Climate Prediction Center said: “Sure, that would be something I’d bet on.
Now looking at the (long-range computer forecast) models, I’d definitely bet on it.
It’s very very likely be warmer than it was four years ago.”That was more than a week ago.
The forecast changed.
An Arctic cold front looks to be racing toward the mid-Atlantic, so it will be cooler than normal, but probably not cooler than 2009, said Christopher Strong, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Sterling, Va., that oversees forecasts for the capital area.Look for highs that day in the upper 30s with noon temperatures in the “middle 30s,” Strong said.
That would keep Obama’s pledge.“That’s certainly below normal,” Strong said.
It’s not as cold as it can be.”The weather would be closer to normal for Cleveland rather than Washington, Strong said.
And there’s a 30 percent chance of light snow showers.But that Arctic front could move in faster than expected with even cooler temperatures, Strong said.
So he put the chance of the noon temperature being colder than 2009’s 28 degrees at 20 percent.Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the private service Weather Underground, said he thinks there’s a 30 percent chance that Obama’s promise won’t be kept.Another factor is that earlier this month cold air suddenly appeared in the uppermost atmosphere and that often means considerably colder weather for America’s East coast for several weeks and it appears to be starting, said Climate Prediction Center forecaster Anthony Artusa.Extreme cold on Inauguration Day, folklore says, can be a killer.In 1841, newly elected president William Henry Harrison stood outside without a coat or hat as he spoke for an hour and 40 minutes.
He caught a cold that day and it became pneumonia and he died one month after being sworn in.
Twelve years later, outgoing first lady Abigail Fillmore got sick from sitting outside on a cold wet platform as Franklin Pierce was inaugurated and she died of pneumonia at the end of the month.
Doctors now know that pneumonia is caused by germs, but prolonged exposure to extreme cold weather may hurt the airways and make someone more susceptible to getting sick.And there’s one thing Washington’s history shows.
Bad weather generally creates bad traffic jams.
John F. Kennedy found that out in his 1961 inauguration when 8 inches of snow fell overnight and crippled the city for what at that time was Washington’s worst traffic jam.
Thousands of cars were abandoned in the snow.Filed under:Barack Obama,Inauguration 2013POLITICOLink CopiedAbout UsAdvertisingBreaking News AlertsCareersCredit Card PaymentsDigital EditionFAQFeedbackHeadlinesPhotosPOWERJobsPressPrint SubscriptionsRequest A CorrectionWrite For UsRSSSite MapTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyDo not sell my infoNotice to California Residents© 2023 POLITICO LLC

As part of this, we’re creating what we’re calling a “Solar Ready Vets” program that’s modeled after some successful pilot initiatives that have already been established over the last several years.
It's going to train transitioning military personnel for careers in this growing industry at 10 bases — including right here at Hill.
And as part of this effort, we’re also going to work with states to enable more veterans to use the Post-9/11 GI Bill for solar job training.
And it’s one of the many steps that we’re taking to help nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a job.
In fact, about 30 percent of the federal workforce is now made up of veterans.
I’ve said it before, and I think employers are starting to catch on, if you really want to get the job done, hire a veteran.

The result was the Paris Agreement.
Last month, the United States and China -- the world’s two largest economies and largest emitters -- formally joined that agreement together.
And today, the world has officially crossed the threshold for the Paris Agreement to take effect.
Today, the world meets the moment.
And if we follow through on the commitments that this agreement embodies, history may well judge it as a turning point for our planet.

Here are their key points on the work ahead to protect the environment and address climate change.Leading the Global Community in Fighting Climate Change“We can build on the foundation of Paris by helping ensure countries take action in a manner that supports their development and the U.S. economy, and we can lead the world in developing and deploying the clean technologies that will create jobs and drive major investment over the coming decades.
The international community expects nothing less – and will react in a highly unfavorable manner if we abdicate our responsibility.”—Secretary KerryReducing Harmful Emissions“To continue to reduce air pollution, the agency will need to address a myriad of environmental concerns.
This includes addressing emerging air quality challenges related to diesel emissions and the various forms of transportation used in and around our marine ports.
In the years ahead, there will be a continued focus on technological approaches to address vehicle emissions—manufacturers and the market will continue to trend toward greater utilization of electric and zero-emission vehicles.
And as the world changes and evolves, we must be prepared to participate in future conversations about carbon markets and emissions trading programs.”—Administrator McCarthyTransitioning to a Clean Energy Economy“To achieve the deep decarbonization necessary later in the century, we need an economy-wide approach that focuses on each of the major sectors that use energy: electricity, buildings, transportation, and industry, along with large scale carbon management.
An approach that combines significantly increased investment in innovation with smartly-designed public policies will accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy, promote American leadership in clean energy technology development and export markets, and create new U.S. jobs.”—Secretary MonizManaging our Nation’s Energy Resources“The Department [of the Interior] must continue to manage our nation’s energy resources with taxpayers, climate change, the environment, and communities all in mind.
This mandate includes devoting resources and expertise to ensure the coal program review is comprehensive, on time, and provides answers to complex questions – while also working across the government to provide assistance to coal communities.
This includes extending similar analysis and reforms to other fossil fuels.
This includes ensuring American taxpayers are getting the maximum benefit from development of their resources by continuing to take a hard look at royalty rates.
And it includes picking up the mantle on bonding requirements for industry, ensuring that companies can’t walk away from their reclamation obligations.
With high-level engagement and additional resources, the Department will be well-equipped to continue our progress toward a sustainable and self-reliant energy future.”—Secretary JewellProtecting and Conserving our Sacred Natural Resources“As we look to the next 100 years of conservation, we face immense challenges.
Climate change threatens our lands and waters in existential ways.
A growing population, coupled with stretched budgets, puts more demand on our natural, cultural, and human resources.
We have laid a solid foundation to meet these challenges, and encourage our successors to continue to ensure the sustainability of our land, water, and wildlife for the next century and beyond.”—Secretary JewellShare this list of President Obama's achievements:Share on FacebookShare on TwitterTwitterInstagramFacebookGoogle+YoutubeMore ways to engageContact UsEmailHomeBriefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest NewsShare-WorthyPhotosVideo GalleryLive EventsMusic & Arts PerformancesFrom the Press OfficeYour Weekly AddressSpeeches & RemarksPress BriefingsStatements & ReleasesWhite House SchedulePresidential ActionsLegislationNominations & AppointmentsDisclosuresIssuesPopular TopicsThe RecordCabinet Exit MemosCriminal Justice ReformCubaSee AllTop IssuesCivil RightsClimate ChangeEconomyEducationForeign PolicyHealth CareIran DealImmigration ActionMoreDefenseDisabilitiesEthicsEqual PayHomeland SecurityReducing Gun ViolenceRuralServiceMoreSeniors & Social SecurityTaxesTechnologyTradeUrban and Economic MobilityVeteransWomenThe AdministrationPeoplePresident Barack ObamaVice President Joe BidenFirst Lady Michelle ObamaDr.

But in fact, the president will have been sworn in officially the day before in a small, private ceremony.
That's because this year, Jan. 20 – Inauguration Day, as mandated by the Constitution – is a Sunday, and by tradition, whenever Inauguration Day lands on a Sunday, the festivities take place the next day.This year, the president's public swearing-in falls on the federal holiday honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., branding the occasion with another layer of historical significance.Monday'sInauguration Day forecastcalls for high temperatures in the low to mid 40s with a moderate southerly breeze.
Tune in to The Weather Channel Saturday, Sunday and Monday for live coverage of the Presidential Inauguration.
Here's how weather played a role in past inaugurations.
Library of Congress)March 4 to Jan. 20Before the 20th Amendment was enacted, Inauguration Day was March 4, the day of the year on which the first Congress convened after the Constitution took effect in 1789.
The last inauguration to take place on March 4 wasFranklin D. Roosevelt'sfirst one in 1933.
He was also the first president to take office on Jan. 20.
When he took his fourth oath of office, above, Roosevelt, who was ill, didn't wear an overcoat even though it was 33 degrees.
Getty Images)Warmest Inauguration, 1981The warmest Jan. 20 Inauguration Day came in 1981 whenRonald Reaganwas sworn into office under mostly cloudy skies.
The temperature at noon was 55 degrees.
Library of Congress)Snowiest Inauguration, 1909In 1909,William H. Taftwas sworn into office on a day nearly 10 inches of snow fell, a record for Inauguration Day.
The snow and wind began the day before, with strong winds toppling trees and telephone poles.
Trains were stalled and city streets clogged.
All activity was brought to a standstill.
Sanitation workers shoveled sand and snow through half the night.
It took 6,000 men and 500 wagons to clear 58,000 tons of snow and slush from the parade route.
AP Photo)Snow on the Ground?Historically speaking on Jan. 20 in Washington, D.C., there is about a 30 percent chance snow will be on the ground from a previous snowfall.
However, there will be no snow on the ground on this year.
Getty Images)JFK's Inauguration, 1961On the eve ofJohn F. Kennedy'sinauguration in 1961, 8 inches of snow fell causing the most crippling traffic jam of its time.
Hundreds of cars were stranded and abandoned.
The president-elect had to cancel dinner plans and, in a struggle to keep other commitments, is reported to have had only 4 hours of sleep.
Former PresidentHerbert Hooverwas unable to fly into Washington National Airport because of the weather and missed the swearing-in ceremony.
By sunrise, the snowfall had ended and the skies cleared but the day remained bitterly cold.An army of men worked all night to clear Pennsylvania Avenue, and despite the cold, a large crowd turned out for the swearing-in ceremony and inaugural parade.
At noon, the temperature was only 22 degrees with the wind blowing from the northwest at 19 mph making it feel like the temperature was just 7 degrees.
Getty Images)Washington AveragesA typical mid-January day in Washington, D.C., during the noon hour consists of partly cloudy skies, a temperature around 37 degrees and wind speeds of just 10 mph.
Getty Images)Washington RecordsThe record high for Jan. 20 in Washington, D.C., is 70 degrees set in 1951.
The record low is -2 degrees set in 1985.
The average high on Jan. 20 is 42 degrees.
The average low is 26 degrees.The record snowfall for Jan. 20 in Washington, D.C., was 3.8 inches set in 1975.
The snowiest Jan. 21 was in 1982 when 3.5 inches of snow fell.
Library of Congress)Fatal Effect, 1841AdvertisementWeather's greatest impact on Inauguration Day came in 1841 whenWilliam Henry Harrisondecided to brave the elements and deliver the longest inauguration speech ever, an oration lasting an hour, 40 minutes.
It was a cloudy, cold and blustery day, and Harrison, who wore neither hat nor overcoat, rode a horse to and from the Capitol ceremony.
He subsequently caught a cold that developed into pneumonia.
A month later, Harrison died.
Library of Congress)Fatal Effect, 1853In 1853,President Franklin Piercewas sworn into office on a cold, snowy day.
Pierce awoke to heavy snow in the morning, which continued until about a half an hour before the ceremony.
Skies looked to be brightening by noon.
However, shortly after Pierce took his oath of office snow began again.
The heavy snow dispersed much of the crowd and ruined plans for the parade.
Abigail Fillmore, first lady to the outgoing PresidentMillard Fillmore, caught a cold as she sat on the cold, wet, exposed platform during Pierce's swearing-in ceremony.
The cold developed into pneumonia and she died at the end of the month.
Getty Images)A Soaker, 1845On Inauguration Day in 1845, a thunderstorm struck Washington, D.C., during the early morning hours.
Rain continued throughout the day.
Total rainfall was 0.40 inches.
PresidentJames K. Polktook his oath of office under an umbrella in heavy rain.
The crowd witnessing the ceremony was a sea of umbrellas with people standing ankle deep in mud.
Library of Congress)Rainiest Inauguration, 1937The first inauguration to be held on Jan. 20 –Franklin D. Roosevelt'ssecond in 1937 – was also a record-setting day.
Some 200,000 visitors came to Washington for the event, though several thousand never got farther than Union Station.
It was a cold and rainy day.
Some sleet and freezing rain was reported in the morning.
Between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., nearly three-quarters of an inch of rain fell.
The ceremony began at 12:23 p.m. with a temperature just over the freezing mark, Roosevelt insisted on riding back to the White House in an open car with a half an inch of water on the floor.
Later, he stood for an hour and a half in an exposed viewing stand watching the inaugural parade splash by in the deluge.
Total rainfall for the day was 1.77 inches and this amount remains as the record rainfall for Jan.
20.
Getty Images)Coldest January Inauguration, 1985The coldest inauguration came in 1985 – also on Jan. 21 – whenRonald Reaganwas greeted by extreme cold and wind.
The morning low was -4 degrees with the temperature reaching only 7 degrees by noon.
The daytime high reached 17 degrees, but wind chills in the afternoon were 10-20 degrees below zero.
The swearing-in ceremony had to be held indoors and the parade was canceled.
Getty Images)Coldest March Inauguration, 1873The coldest March 4 ceremony was held in 1873 whenUlysses S. Grantwas sworn into office for his second term.
The temperature at noon was 16 degrees after a record overnight low for the month of March of just 4 degrees.
Even with sunny skies during the ceremony, the temperature remained bitterly cold.
Getty Images)Obama's First Inauguration, 2009Skies were clear and the high hit 30 degrees forBarack Obama'sfirst inauguration on Jan. 20, 2009.
It was breezy.
Winds averaged 12.6 mph in Washington that day.
The inauguration marked the largest attendance of any event in the history of Washington, D.C.(Getty Images)Bush Inauguration, 2005During PresidentGeorge W. Bush'ssecond inauguration in 2005, it was mostly cloudy with some breaks of sunshine with a northwest wind of 14 mph.
About 1 inch of snow lay on the ground.
Library of Congress)First Outdoor Oath, 1817James Madisonwas the first president to take the oath of office outdoors on March 4, 1817, a day described as warm and sunny with a temperature at noon estimated to be 50 degrees.
Getty Images)First Parade, 1805Thomas Jefferson– Jefferson Memorial, above – was the first president to complete his inauguration with a parade.
Since Jefferson's second inauguration on March 4, 1805, it has become tradition for the president to parade down Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House.
Library of Congress)Two Non-Consecutive TermsGrover Clevelandis the only American president to attend two inaugurations as the outgoing president, enjoying the claim of being the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms.
After four years as the nation's 22nd president, Cleveland was beaten in the election of 1888 by Benjamin Harrison, and attended Harrison's inauguration in March of 1889.Upon leaving the White House, Frances Cleveland told a staff member to "take good care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, when we come back again."
When asked when she planned to return, she said, "We are coming back four years from today."
And she was right.
In the election of 1892, Cleveland was re-elected in a rematch against Harrison, and after four more years in office he attended the 1897 inauguration ofWilliam McKinley, who had defeated Williams Jennings Bryan.

With President’s Day afoot, we’re looking at five other leaders who could not only hold their own in the Oval Office but also hold a tune.

KingBarack ObamaSee latest videos, charts and newsBarack ObamaWith the ease of social media, Obama may go down as the most recognized musical leader of them all.
Our 44th President’s brief rendition (just a line) of Al Green’s “Let’s Stay Together” back at a January 2012 fundraiser has racked up millions of views on YouTube.
The viral sensation led to blues legend Buddy Guy calling him up on stage to perform hometown anthem “Sweet Home Chicago” alongside Guy, B.B.
King, Mick Jagger and more.

King & Mick JaggerBill ClintonThe 42nd president of the United States (1993-2001) had so much early success with his music (winning first chair in the Arkansas state band saxophone section) that he considered a career in it.
In his autobiography, Clinton pondered a life dedicated to the tenor sax, but set those hopes aside, admitting, “I knew I would never be John Coltrane or Stan Getz.” After winning the presidency, he made a defining career move when he performed Elvis’ “Heartbreak Hotel” on the “Arsenio Hall Show” — a move that proved him to be a president for the MTV generation.
Clinton’s appreciation was further proven with a 1993 White House celebration of the Newport Jazz Festival’s 40th anniversary, where he jammed onstage alongside jazz sax legends.Richard NixonBefore his career became overshadowed in controversy, our 37th president (1969-1974) proved to be one of the most musical.
While his accordion skills were far from hidden, Nixon was also quite the accomplished pianist.
He wrote his own concerto, aptly titled “Richard Nixon Piano Concerto #1,” which he played on primetime TV’s “Jack Paar Program” in 1963.
Nixon also showcased his piano chops at various events including playing “God Bless America” on the Grand Ole Opry stage and accompanying singer Pearl Bailey in a performance at the White House.Dwight D. EisenhowerDid our 34th president (1953-1961) start the music compilation trend?
Perhaps.
In 1956, Eisenhower released an album titled “The President’s Favorite Music: Dwight D. Eisenhower” with the cover featuring him and first lady Mamie.
While the duo was no brand like Sonny and Cher, the album did see the White House using music in a fun, interesting way, a laObama’s 2012 Spotify playlist.
Thestill available Eisenhower LPfeatured classical favorites like Bach, Beethoven and Strauss alongside more contemporary tracks like those from “Porgy and Bess” and Marian Anderson’s rendition of “He’s Got The Whole World In His Hands.”Thomas JeffersonOur third president (1801-1809) was quoted saying that music “is the favorite passion of my soul,” and apparently the man meant it.
His granddaughter, Ellen Wayles Coolidge, lived above his bedroom and said that Jefferson was “always singing when ridin’ or walkin’.” Meanwhile, his plantation overseer, Edmund Bacon, noted, “he was nearly always humming some tune, or singing in a low tone to himself.” No shy singing here!
Plus Jefferson, whose favorite composer was Joseph Haydn, reportedly played cello, clavichord and violin.Get weekly rundowns straight to your inboxSubscribeWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?Get in the know onVisit Billboard Pro for music business newsTrendingHoward Stern Is ‘Dumbfounded’ Over Kid Rock & Travis Tritt’s TransphobiaTed Nugent Calls Anheuser-Busch’s Dylan Mulvaney Partnership ‘the Epitome of Cultural Deprivation’Dee Snider on Letting Gun Control Advocates Use ‘We’re Not Gonna Take It’: ‘Sometimes You Have to Say Enough is Enough’Millie Bobby Brown Quotes Taylor Swift’s ‘Lover’ Lyrics in Apparent Engagement AnnouncementIam Tongi Delivers ‘Showstopping’ Performance on ‘American Idol’: WatchThe DailyA daily briefing on what matters in the music industryEmail AddressSign UpSign UpBy subscribing, I agree to theTerms of UseandPrivacy Policy.

But he has a very diverse taste in music, as I recall he is quite familiar with Jazz and jazz history, Billie Holiday seemed to come up quite a bit i think.Marley23January 29, 2009,  6:02am5I’m pretty sure he never mentioned playing an instrument in either of his books.Cider_DepotJanuary 29, 2009,  6:49am6This is interesting, as a slight hijack.

We’ve analysed the evidence.Al Green - Let’s Stay TogetherThis is perhaps the first time the world realised that Barack Obama might just have a singing voice in there somewhere.
This speech, back in 2012, was attended by The Reverend Al Green, soul legend and owner of one of the most iconic voices in history.So the former-POTUS decided this would be the time to pay small tribute to a legend, by singing the opening line of ‘Let’s Stay Together’.
Obama shows total ease with a high tenor line, sensitive and very much in tune.
Even more impressive, he’s actually singing in the exactly correct key of the original recording, suggesting there might be something resembling perfect pitch (or at least great intuition) in Obama's musical arsenal.Listen to both and compare:Happy BirthdayAfter a promising Al Green impersonation, however, comes this slightly duff rendition of Happy Birthday.
Not that Happy Birthday is often a barometer of great singing, but still.
This impromptu performance suffers from Obama starting so high that when he reaches the climax he has to duck out and let the crowd take over.
Nice sentiment, flawed execution.Happy Birthday againWow, Obama really loves singing Happy Birthday.
This time, it’s for his daughter, Malia, and unfortunately the song still proves a bit of a stumbling block.
He finally manages to slide up that huge octave leap at the end, but it’s a bit hairy.Gospel call & responseAt this White House tribute to the great Ray Charles, the former President takes the stage to kick off a Gospel singalong with a simple call and response refrain.
His ‘Hey’ and his ‘Ho’ are perhaps missing the gusto of previous performances, but they’re smack in the comfort zone of his tenor range and, therefore, perfectly adequate to get the party started:Amazing GracePerhaps his most poignant performance, this rendition of ‘Amazing Grace’ came at a difficult and emotional time for the USA and for Obama himself - the memorial service of Clementa Pinckney, one of the victims of the 2015 Charleston shootings.Undaunted but clearly emotional, Obama opens the song up to huge cheers.
But notice how he tweaks the major third in the opening phrase to give it that gospel swagger - this is the technique of someone who clearly knows how to manipulate music for specific effect.

Does Barack Obama's Favorite Music Make Him More Interesting?ServicesBIGG SolutionsJoin Our CommunityFollow Our PodcastAboutContactMenuMenuBlogDoes Barack Obama’s Favorite Music Make Him More Interesting?June 27, 2008/inProfessional Development/byGeorge Krueger & Mary-Lynn FosterRolling Stone interviewed Barack Obama recently.
He revealed his iPod play list, which included songs by:Earth, Wind & FireElton JohnThe Rolling StonesSheryl CrowYo-Yo MaJay-ZBob DylanStevie WonderHe said Stevie Wonder is his musical hero.
We learn more about him because he shared his musical taste.
He’s in touch with the classics and brilliant musicians.
He shows his age, yet he’s still in touch with artists of today.http://media.libsyn.com/media/biggsuccess/00165-062708.mp3Subscribe:Apple Podcasts|Google Podcasts|Spotify|RSS|MoreMary-Lynn says …When I think of Bob Dylan, I think of music with a message … that sense of activism.When I think of Yo-Yo Ma or Stevie Wonder, I think of great musicianship.And I think of the song, I Wish.
How when I was working in radio, I was always excited when that song was coming up.
I’d crank it when it was on and do my own boogie!George replies …When I think of Stevie Wonder, I think about the Saturday Night Live skit where he was playing tennis!
He got hit by a lot of balls!Seriously, I think of Ebony and Ivory.
I’m a lyrics guy.
I can picture the keyboard with its ebony and ivory keys.
And Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder singing it.
It’s powerful!Sharing opens up the conversationSo you see what’s happening here.
Barack Obama revealed things about himself.
Now we’re revealing things about ourselves.
When you share, you open up the conversation because the other person finds things to be interested in.
So they find you more interesting and get to know you better.
And you connect with them.So let’s take a page from the politician’s playbook – they look for every single way they can to connect with people.George’s example:I’m a husband, a business owner, a professor, a blogger, a podcaster, an alum of the best university in the world … the University of Illinois.
And the list goes on.
Kind of like Sonny & Cher’s beat!It’s how people can relate to you, by finding things in common with you.The more you share, the more you connectThat’s why one of our friends says that you should fill out your profile completely on social networking sites, when you join an organization, and at every opportunity.
Share as much about yourself and your interests as you feel comfortable sharing.We can learn a lesson from politicians on this – the more you share, the more you connect!Mary-Lynn says …As we prepared for this show, one of the things we talked about is how neither one of us has been listening to much music lately.
This really surprises me about myself because I was a musician and a music disc jockey for many years.
So music has been an integral part of my life.George replied …That begs the question, Mary-Lynn.
Why aren’t you listening to more music now?And I think I know the answer – you get to hear me sing in the shower!
What more could you possibly need?Mary-Lynn’s retort …That’s not music to my ears, George!I work at my computer a lot and whenever I am in the car they’re always playing the same songs on the radio.
So I just flip to talk.Connect with yourselfMusic is an opportunity to connect with others, but more importantly, it lets you connect with yourself.
So make time for things that touch you deeply – in your mind, your heart, and your soul.Whether that be music or something else.What do you do to connect to others and yourself?
Is there something you used to do that you need to reconnect with?Related posts462]98]34]32]260](Image byrollingstone.com)Share this entryShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare on PinterestShare on LinkedInShare on TumblrShare on RedditShare by Mailhttps://biggsuccess.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bigg-success_stacked-1080.png10801080George Krueger & Mary-Lynn Fosterhttps://biggsuccess.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BIGG-Success-Nurturing-Your-Inner-Entreprener.jpgGeorge Krueger & Mary-Lynn Foster2008-06-27 00:30:282015-06-14 15:58:18Does Barack Obama’s Favorite Music Make Him More Interesting?You might also likeWhy You Should Never Retire But Do It Soon1,000 Podcast Episodes of The BIGG Success ShowTake Control of Your Life with a Garden Hose11 + 11 + 11 Ways to Be a SuccessBusting Into A NicheA Short Pencil is Better than a Long MemoryAbout George & Mary-LynnGeorge is a serial business owner who also teaches entrepreneurship at the University of Illinois.Read more.Mary-Lynn is a veteran radio show host turned entrepreneur.

According to the listing agent Nancy Morton, this is the only single-family house Obama lived in while in Hawaii and she said his family rented the house during their time there.
The property has often been used as a rental since it is in a coveted area of the Manoa neighborhood within walking distance of public schools and plenty of stores.
The homeis asking $2.2 millionafter selling in 2006 for $1.3 million, according to property records.There are only about two dozen homes for sale in the neighborhood and this one is the fourth most expensive for what is on the market at the moment.
A$3 million homewith six bedrooms and five bathrooms is at the top of the market and at the other end isa two-bed, two-bath condoasking half a million.
All the single-family homes start around $1 million.Living RoomCBI Residential ServicesThe main house on the quarter-acre lot is just under 2,000 square feet with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.
A second one-bedroom, one-bath dwelling about 300 square feet sits at the back of the lot with driving access to the quieter street behind the property.
If the new owners wanted to turn the [entry] direction of the main house to be on the cottage side they could,” said Morton, referring to the high-traffic nature of the main road in front of the lot.The current owner is a church located on the street behind the property that has used the main house as a rental, most frequently for professors or other members of the university community, for around $3,700 per month (per its latest rent price).
The small cottage has been used as housing for the church pastor, but now the church is selling the entire parcel to raise money for an expansion.MORE FOR YOUThe Inside Story Of Papa John's Toxic CultureShares Of Weight Watchers Parent Surge 60% After Pivot To OzempicWhy Does The Bud Light Backlash Feel So Desperate?PorchCBI Residential ServicesWith hardwood floors and main rooms full of floor-to-ceiling windows, the home still has a rustic feel.
It was built in the 1940s, as were many of the homes in this neighborhood, but had significant renovations in the 1960s, including upgrading the windows to keep out traffic noise, said Morton.
Above is a close-up of the porch, which has a large setback from the steps to provide shade.

14, 2008, 7:07 AM UTC/Source:The Associated PressA perplexing new chapter is unfolding in Barack Obama's racial saga: Many people insist that "the first black president" is actually not black.Debate over whether to call this son of a white Kansan and a black Kenyan biracial, African-American, mixed-race, half-and-half, multiracial — or, in Obama's own words, a "mutt" — has reached a crescendo since Obama's election shattered assumptions about race.Obama has said, "I identify as African-American — that's how I'm treated and that's how I'm viewed.
I'm proud of it."
In other words, the world gave Obama no choice but to be black, and he was happy to oblige.But the world has changed since the young Obama found his place in it.Intermarriage and the decline of racism are dissolving ancient definitions.
The candidate Obama, in achieving what many thought impossible, was treated differently from previous black generations.
And many white and mixed-race people now view President-elect Obama as something other than black.So what now for racial categories born of a time when those from far-off lands were property rather than people, or enemy instead of family?
They're falling apart," said Marty Favor, a Dartmouth professor of African and African-American studies and author of the book "Authentic Blackness.
In 1903, W.E.B.
DuBois said the question of the 20th century is the question of the color line, which is a simplistic black-white thing," said Favor, who is biracial.
This is the moment in the 21st century when we're stepping across that.
Obama is whatever people project onto him'Rebecca Walker, a 38-year-old writer with light brown skin who is of Russian, African, Irish, Scottish and Native American descent, said she used to identify herself as "human," which upset people of all backgrounds.
So she went back to multiracial or biracial, "but only because there has yet to be a way of breaking through the need to racially identify and be identified by the culture at large.
Of course Obama is black.
And he's not black, too," Walker said.
He's white, and he's not white, too.
Obama is whatever people project onto him ... he's a lot of things, and neither of them necessarily exclude the other.
But U.S. Rep. G. K. Butterfield, a black man who by all appearances is white, feels differently.Butterfield, 61, grew up in a prominent black family in Wilson, N.C.
Both of his parents had white forebears, "and those genes came together to produce me."
He grew up on the black side of town, led civil rights marches as a young man, and to this day goes out of his way to inform people that he is certainly not white.Butterfield has made his choice; he says let Obama do the same.
Obama has chosen the heritage he feels comfortable with," he said.
His physical appearance is black.
I don't know how he could have chosen to be any other race.
Let's just say he decided to be white — people would have laughed at him.
You are a product of your experience.
I'm a U.S. congressman, and I feel some degree of discomfort when I'm in an all-white group.
We don't have the same view of the world, our experiences have been different.
One-drop' ruleThe entire issue balances precariously on the "one-drop" rule, which sprang from the slaveowner habit of dropping by the slave quarters and producing brown babies.
One drop of black blood meant that person, and his or her descendants, could never be a full citizen.Today, the spectrum of skin tones among African-Americans — even those with two black parents — is evidence of widespread white ancestry.
Also, since blacks were often light enough to pass for white, unknown numbers of white Americans today have blacks hidden in their family trees.One book, "Black People and their Place in World History," by Dr. Leroy Vaughn, even claims that five past presidents — Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge — had black ancestors, which would make Obama the sixth of his kind.Mix in a few centuries' worth of Central, South and Native Americans, plus Asians, and untold millions of today's U.S. citizens need a DNA test to decipher their true colors.
The melting pot is working.Yet the world has never been confronted with such powerful evidence as Obama.
So as soon as he was elected, the seeds of confusion began putting down roots.
Let's not forget that he is not only the first African-American president, but the first biracial candidate.
He was raised by a single white mother," a Fox News commentator said seven minutes after Obama was declared the winner.
We do not have our first black president," the author Christopher Hitchens said on the BBC program "Newsnight."
He is not black.
He is as black as he is white.
A Doonesbury comic strip that ran the day after the election showed several soldiers celebrating.
He's half-white, you know," says a white soldier.
You must be so proud," responds another.Pride is the center of racial identity, and some white people seem insulted by a perception that Obama is rejecting his white mother (even though her family was a centerpiece of his campaign image-making) or baffled by the notion that someone would choose to be black instead of half-white.
He can't be African-American.
With race, white claims 50 percent of him and black 50 percent of him.
Half a loaf is better than no loaf at all," Ron Wilson of Plantation, Fla., wrote in a letter to the Sun-Sentinel newspaper.Attempts to whiten Obama leave a bitter taste for many African-Americans, who feel that at their moment of triumph, the rules are being changed to steal what once was deemed worthless — blackness itself.
For some people it's honestly confusion," said Favor, the Dartmouth professor.
For others it's a ploy to sort of reclaim the presidency for whiteness, as though Obama's blackness is somehow mitigated by being biracial.
Then there are the questions remaining from Obama's entry into national politics, when some blacks were leery of this Hawaiian-born newcomer who did not share their history.Linda Bob, a black schoolteacher from Eustis, Fla., said that calling Obama black when he was raised in a white family and none of his ancestors experienced slavery could cause some to ignore or forget the history of racial injustice.
It just seems unfair to totally label him African-American without acknowledging that he was born to a white mother," she said.
It makes you feel like he doesn't have a class, a group.
There is at least one group eagerly waiting for Obama to embrace them.
To me, as to increasing numbers of mixed-race people, Barack Obama is not our first black president.
He is our first biracial, bicultural president ... a bridge between races, a living symbol of tolerance, a signal that strict racial categories must go," Marie Arana wrote in the Washington Post.He's a bridge between eras as well.
The multiracial category "wasn't there when I was growing up," said John McWhorter, a 43-year-old fellow at the Manhattan Institute's Center for Race and Ethnicity, who is black.
In the '70s and the '80s, if somebody had one white parent and one black parent, the idea was they were black and had better get used to it and develop this black identity.
That's now changing.
Transitional period'Latinos, whom the census identifies as an ethnic group and not a race, were not counted separately by the government until the 1970s.
After the 1990 census, many people complained that the four racial categories — white, black, Asian, and American Indian/Alaska native — did not fit them.
The government then allowed people to check more than one box.
It also added a fifth category, for Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders.
Six million people, or 2 percent of the population, now say they belong to more than one race, according to the most recent census figures.
Another 19 million people, or 6 percent of the population, identify themselves as "some other race" than the five available choices.The White House Office of Management and Budget, which oversees the census, specifically decided not to add a "multiracial" category, deeming it not a race in and of itself.
We are in a transitional period" regarding these labels, McWhorter said.
I think that in only 20 years, the notion that there are white people and there are black people and anyone in between has some explaining to do and an identity to come up with, that will all seem very old-fashioned.
The debate over Obama's identity is just the latest step in a journey he unflinchingly chronicled in his memoir, "Dreams from My Father.
As a teenager, grappling with the social separation of his white classmates, "I had no idea who my own self was," Obama wrote.No single definitionIn college in the 1970s, like millions of other dark-skinned Americans searching for self respect in a discriminatory nation, Obama found refuge in blackness.
Classmates who sidestepped the label "black" in favor of "multiracial" chafed at Obama's newfound pride: "They avoided black people," he wrote.
It wasn't a matter of conscious choice, necessarily, just a matter of gravitational pull, the way integration always worked, a one-way street.
The minority assimilated into the dominant culture, not the other way around.
Fast-forward 30 years, to the early stages of Obama's presidential campaign.
Minorities are on track to outnumber whites, to redefine the dominant American culture.
And the black political establishment, firmly rooted in the civil rights movement, questioned whether the outsider Obama was "black enough.
Then came the primary and general elections, when white voters were essential for victory.
Now I'm too black," Obama joked in July before an audience of minority journalists.
There is this sense of going back and forth depending on the time of day in terms of making assessments about my candidacy.
Today, it seems no single definition does justice to Obama — or to a nation where the revelation that Obama's eighth cousin is Dick Cheney, the white vice president from Wyoming, caused barely a ripple in the campaign.In his memoir, Obama says he was deeply affected by reading that Malcolm X, the black nationalist-turned-humanist, once wished his white blood could be expunged.
Traveling down the road to self-respect my own white blood would never recede into mere abstraction," Obama wrote.
I was left to wonder what else I would be severing if I left my mother and my grandparents at some uncharted border.

The former Illinois state senator’s election signaled a feeling of hope for the future even as the U.S. was undergoing its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
While working to improve the economy, Obama enacted the Affordable Care Act, extending health benefits to millions of previously uninsured Americans.
Overseas, he oversaw the drawdown of American troops in the Middle East—a force reduction that was controversially replaced with an expansion of drone and aviation strikes.
Though his mission to kill Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden was successful, his pledge to close the Guantanamo prison went unrealized.
Obama grew up in Hawaii, where he was one of only three black students at the Punahou School.
As a student, he became aware of what it meant to be African American—a realization he later brought with him to the White House.
After high school, Obama studied at Occidental College (Los Angeles) and graduated from Columbia University (New York City), where he earned a degree in political science in 1983.
After working in the business sector for two years, he moved to Chicago, where he ultimately met his wife, Michelle Robinson.
In Chicago, he worked in the impoverished South Side as a community organizer for low-income residents in the Roseland and the Altgeld Gardens communities.
Obama entered Harvard Law School in 1988, graduating magna cum laude in 1991.
While at Harvard, he was elected the first African American editor of the Harvard Law Review.
After law school, Obama returned to Chicago to practice as a civil rights lawyer with the firm of Miner, Barnhill & Galland.
He also taught constitutional law part-time at the University of Chicago Law School between 1992 and 2004—first as a lecturer and then as a professor—and helped organize voter registration drives during Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign.
Obama’s advocacy work led him to run for a seat in the Illinois State Senate, where he won the election as a Democrat in 1996.
During his years as a state senator, Obama worked with both Democrats and Republicans to draft legislation on ethics, as well as expand health care services and early childhood education programs for the poor.
In 2004, he joined the United States Senate after winning the largest electoral victory in Illinois history.
With this win, Obama became only the third African American elected to the U.S. Senate since Reconstruction.About the ArtistKehinde WileyBy placing contemporary figures in the guise of powerful historic figures, such as Napoleon or John D. Rockefeller, Kehinde Wiley applies the conventions of glorification, history, wealth, and prestige found in art historical portraiture to urban, contemporary black and brown male subjects.
Without shying away from potentially complicated socio-political histories, Wiley’s figurative paintings and sculptures reference historical sources and position young black men within the field of power.
Wiley’s larger than life figures often blur the boundaries between traditional and contemporary methods of representation.
President Obama said at the portrait unveiling: “What I was always struck by whenever I saw [Wiley’s] portraits was the degree to which they challenged our conventional views of power and privilege and the way that he would take extraordinary care and precision and vision in recognizing the beauty and the grace and the dignity of people who are so often invisible in our lives and put them on a grand stage, on a grand scale, and force us to look and see them in ways that so often they were not.”About the PaintingBarack Obama and Kehinde WileyThis near life-size portrait celebrates Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United States of America.
The former president is shown surrounded by nature and symbolic flowers that reflect both his personal and professional history.
The chrysanthemums, for example, reference the official flower of Chicago.
The jasmine evokes Hawaii, where he spent the majority of his childhood, and the African blue lilies stand in for his late Kenyan father.
The vibrant colors and casual pose of the portrait are decidedly modern, placing him firmly in the present day.
Rather than appropriate a past portrait and paint Obama in that individual’s position, as he typically does, Wiley and Obama together decided that this composition should be “wholly new,” reflecting Obama’s singular position in history.
While the painting does have echoes of past presidential portraiture, such as the National Portrait Gallery’s seated portrait of Abraham Lincoln, it is not a direct reference.Portrait Observation and Analysis• Look at the flowers (and leaves) in the background.

Our founders quarreled and compromised, and expected us to do the same.
But they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity—the idea that for all our outward differences, we are all in this together; that we rise or fall as one.” Consider two of our past presidents together and create a Venn diagram or craft a comparative essay detailing their similarities and differences.
Consider why it is important to find common ground, even when you disagree about something.America’s Presidents ExhibitionThe National Portrait Gallery’s America’s Presidents exhibition lies at the very heart of the museum’s mission to tell the American story through individuals who have shaped the country.
It showcases images of the past forty-four U.S. presidents, starting with George Washington and concluding with Barack Obama.
Six presidents are given expanded attention because of their significant impact on the office: George Washington, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan.
Over the past five decades, each of the National Portrait Gallery’s directors has made acquiring presidential images a priority, and consequently, the museum currently holds over 1,600 portraits of U.S. presidents in a variety of media.
Beginning with President George H. W. Bush, the National Portrait Gallery initiated a process by which the museum would commission a portrait of each president, and beginning with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, this process expanded to include a commissioned portrait of the first spouse.
The Portrait Gallery works closely with the White House to suggest the artists for these artworks and to obtain various approvals.
Usually, the portraits are created at the end of the president’s final term in office.
All are privately funded and are owned by the National Portrait Gallery.
The Portrait Gallery hopes to continue this initiative to ensure that the museum acquires formal portraits of every American president and first spouse for its permanent collection.Image credits:Barack Obama's portrait:Barack Obamaby Kehinde Wiley, oil on canvas, 2018.

Biden Jr.The biography for President Obama and past presidents is courtesy of the White House Historical Association.Barack Obama served as the 44th President of the United States.
His story is the American story — values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in service to others.When Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, he became the first African American to hold the office.
The framers of the Constitution always hoped that our leadership would not be limited to Americans of wealth or family connections.
Subject to the prejudices of their time—many of them owned slaves—most would not have foreseen an African American president.
Obama’s father, Barack Sr., a Kenyan economist, met his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, when both were students in Hawaii, where Barack was born on August 4, 1961.
They later divorced, and Barack’s mother married a man from Indonesia, where he spent his early childhood.
Before fifth grade, he returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents and attend Punahou School on scholarship.In his memoirDreams from My Father(1995), Obama describes the complexities of discovering his identity in adolescence.
After two years at Occidental College in Los Angeles, he transferred to Columbia University, where he studied political science and international relations.
Following graduation in 1983, Obama worked in New York City, then became a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago, coordinating with churches to improve housing conditions and set up job-training programs in a community hit hard by steel mill closures.
In 1988, he went to Harvard Law School, where he attracted national attention as the first African American president of theHarvard Law Review.
Returning to Chicago, he joined a small law firm specializing in civil rights.In 1992, Obama married Michelle Robinson, a lawyer who had also excelled at Harvard Law.
Their daughters, Malia and Sasha, were born in 1998 and 2001, respectively.
Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, and then to the U.S. Senate in 2004.
At the Democratic National Convention that summer, he delivered a much acclaimed keynote address.
Some pundits instantly pronounced him a future president, but most did not expect it to happen for some time.
Nevertheless, in 2008 he was elected over Arizona Senator John McCain by 365 to 173 electoral votes.As an incoming president, Obama faced many challenges—an economic collapse, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the continuing menace of terrorism.
Inaugurated before an estimated crowd of 1.8 million people, Obama proposed unprecedented federal spending to revive the economy and also hoped to renew America’s stature in the world.
During his first term he signed three signature bills: an omnibus bill to stimulate the economy, legislation making health care more accessible and affordable, and legislation reforming the nation’s financial institutions.
Obama also pressed for a fair pay act for women, financial reform legislation, and efforts for consumer protection.
In 2009, Obama became the fourth president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.In 2012, he was reelected over former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney by 332 to 206 electoral votes.
The Middle East remained a key foreign policy challenge.
Obama had overseen the killing of Osama bin Laden, but a new self-proclaimed Islamic State arose during a civil war in Syria and began inciting terrorist attacks.
Obama sought to manage a hostile Iran with a treaty that hindered its development of nuclear weapons.
The Obama administration also adopted a climate change agreement signed by 195 nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming.In the last year of his second term, Obama spoke at two events that clearly moved him—the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery, and the dedication of the National Museum of African American History and Culture.
Our union is not yet perfect, but we are getting closer,” he said in Selma.
And that’s why we celebrate,” he told those attending the museum opening in Washington, “mindful that our work is not yet done.”Learn more about Barack Obama’s spouse,Michelle Obama.President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama pose with their daughters, Malia and SashaStay ConnectedSign UpEmail Address*RequiredZIP CodePlease leave blank.We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.ShareShare this page on FacebookShare this page on Twitterhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/barack-obama/?utm_source=linkHomeThe AdministrationExecutive OfficesPrioritiesThe RecordBriefing RoomThe White HouseDisclosuresGet InvolvedEspañolContact UsPrivacy PolicyCopyright PolicyAccessibility StatementInstagramOpens in a new windowFacebookOpens in a new windowTwitterOpens in a new windowYouTubeOpens in a new windowThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave NWWashington, DC 20500WH.govScroll to TopScroll to TopTop

on Monday, as the former president tweeted his favorite songs of the year.
In the previous two days, he’d posted his favorite books andmovies, and we’re probably not getting a standalone TV list, since he already added a few shows to his movie list that he said he “considered as powerful as movies.” By now the annual tradition is expected, and in the replies to Obama’s tweets any number of expressions of longing for the return of his cool-guy tastes to the White House can be found.
Last week theNew York Timespublished anop-edtitled “In Praise of Barack Obama, Music Critic.”This year Obama seemed to signal his attunement to the diffuse state of popular music, where genre-agnosticism is often a virtue, by noting that his picks ranged “from hip-hop to country to The Boss.” He included American breakoutsLizzoandDaBaby,Nigerian artistsBurna BoyandRema,andRosalíaandJ Balvin’s"Con Altura," although he omitted Balvin’s credit on the song.
He said he was listening to this year’s folk rock darling Big Thief.
He was well aware of “Old Town Road,” a song at the center of all sorts of playlists, streaming records, and conversations this year but not quite as ubiquitous in the flurry of year-end lists.
And he even waited untilKaytranadareleased a new album on December 13 to solidify his choices.As ever, there’s the sourcing question.
What Spotify playlists, and which music advisers are involved here?
Obama’s book listraised some eyebrows, with its inclusion ofThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of PowerbyShoshana Zuboff,which, as the reporter and researcherAvi Ascher-Schapiropointed outon Twitter, “argues that the ‘revolving door of personnel who migrated between Google & the Obama admin’...helped ‘fortify’ the surveillance capitalism business model.”Or is it more of a family matter?
Back in Obama’s second term, it didn’t escape notice that his daughterMaliawore a Pro Era T-shirt.Whatever the case, there are some relatively under-the-radar picks and opportunities for discovery here.Angelica Garciaput on a quiet, wonderful show in New York a few months ago in a 250-capacity room.

Well, luckily for you it is available right here in Shenzhen.Email of the writer: adinglily@hotmail.comDo you want to eat the ice cream that former U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife had on their first date?
Well, luckily for you it is available right here in Shenzhen.The ice cream so favored by the Obamas as well as many other celebrities is none other than Baskin-Robbins.
There are two Baskin-Robbins in Shenzhen, one in Sea World in Nanshan District and the other in Coco City in Longhua District.Donson Zhan is the owner of the Baskin-Robbins in Sea World.
He got to know the brand for the first time in 2011 when he took a trip to Shanghai and his friends invited him to the ice cream shop.The exterior of the Shekou store.“When I looked at the dozens of flavors, I couldn’t decide what to have.
Fortunately, the waiter helped me by picking several flavors for me to try after consulting my preferences.
At last, I picked strawberry cheesecake, which is my favorite flavor even now,” Zhan said.After the unforgettable experience in Shanghai, Zhan became quite interested in Baskin-Robbins.“I went to the official website of Baskin-Robbins and found that the brand originated in California.
And that customers could try all the flavors in the shop until they found the one they loved.
However, among the introductions, the slogan ‘we make people happy’ left me with the deepest impression,” Zhan recalled.Touched by the idea that Baskin-Robbins brings happiness to their customers, Zhan decided to open his own ice cream shop so he could deliver happiness to his friends, customers as well as hardworking clerks.
And on Christmas day of 2013, his ice cream shop officially opened.One of Baskin-Robbins key ideologies is that people should be able to sample flavors until they find the one they want to buy.
And to the tune of that idea, the company has introduced more than 1,000 flavors since 1945.“A variety of ice cream flavors is one of the most evident features of our brand.
Our company is known for its ‘31 flavors’ slogan, with the idea that a customer could have a different flavor every day of any month.
We also designed special flavors for different groups of people, such as marshmallow-flavored ice cream for children and low-fat sugar-free ice cream for people who are concerned about their health,” Zhan expressed.On one of the shop’s walls they have the history of Baskin-Robbins displayed.
From 1945 until now, our brand has developed many classical flavors and we hope that the wall can enable our customers to know more about our history,” Zhan said.Baskin-Robbins is the world’s largest ice cream restaurant chain.
It has nearly 7,600 retail shops in 50 countries.
Based in Canton, Massachusetts, it was founded in 1945 by Burt Baskin and Irv Robbins in Glendale, California.Map

5, 2021  5:07 pm ESTImagine stopping in for a scoop of your favorite ice cream, or maybe a sundae or a waffle cone, and the smiling face behind the freezer display case looks a little familiar.
Now envision that person working at the ice cream shop resembling former PresidentBarack Obama.
It may be surprising and hard to believe that Obama would ever be the scooper behind your preferred frozen treat.
But, before becoming a community organizer turned senator in Chicago, the 44th president and "A Promised Land" author's first job was at popular ice cream chainBaskin-Robbins, according toDallas Morning News.
Prior to moving to Chicago, he worked at the chain's Honolulu location when he was just a teenager.After moving on from Baskin-Robbins and Hawaii, ice cream continued to be a part of Obama's journey.
According toWide Open Eats, Obama took then-girlfriend, Michelle Obama, to a local Baskin-Robbins.
And how's this for a treat?
The two shared their first kiss while sitting on the curb outside of the ice cream chain, perInstagram.
I kissed her, and it tasted like chocolate," Obama revealed toO, The Oprah Magazinein the February 2007 issue.Oh, in case you were wondering what Obama'sfavorite flavor of ice creamis, the answer might surprise you more than the thought of him working at Baskin-Robbins.Politiconotes he lost interest after eating so many free scoops.
But besides unlimited ice cream, what else did Obama gain from his first job experience?What former President Obama learned from working at Baskin-RobbinsShutterstockAccording toDallas Morning News, Obama described working at Baskin-Robbins as an unglamorous job.
Although it's true Obama wasn't exactly thrilled at the thought of scooping compromising his wrist flick for his favorite sport, the former president admitted he learned a few things from the experience.
So what were those valuable lessons?
Responsibility.
Hard work.
Balancing a job with friends, family, and school," Obama wrote, per Dallas Morning News.As reported byPolitico, Obama shared his backstory on working at Baskin-Robbins to promote the 2016 Summer Opportunity Project, an initiative that aided young adults in securing their first job and helping them with the transition from high school and college to a professional career.Even if the downside was sore wrists and disinterest in ice cream, it sounds like Obama took something away from the opportunity.
We can all agree that these lessons were beneficial to him in his presidency and in his personal life.
I'll never forget that job — or the people who gave me that opportunity — and how they helped me get to where I am today," he wrote, per Politico.Recommended

Did President Woodrow Wilson spot an ice cream cone or two in the crowd during his 1913 inauguration?
Did President John F. Kennedy reach for a bowl of chocolate ice cream during the tense negotiations of the Cuban Missile Crisis?
We may never know.
But we do know these 10 weird fun facts about US presidents and ice cream:George WashingtonYou know how theold sayinggoes: “First in war, first in peace, first to absolutely lose his mind over ice cream.” George Washington loved ice cream so much that he even brought a bunch of ice cream-making and -serving supplies to theWhite Housewith him.
He also reportedly spent$200on his favorite treat during the summer of 1790—which comes to about $5,000 today!
That probably puts your Half Baked obsession in perspective.Thomas JeffersonIt would be hard to top Washington’s passion for the stuff, butThomas Jeffersoncertainly left his mark as an ice cream fanatic.
In fact, he has been credited with writing down the first known ice creamrecipein American history!
You can trymakinghis vanilla yourself.
James MadisonAt 5’ 4” and barely 100 lb.,James Madisonwas not known as a voracious eater.
But he did apparently always have room for ice cream.
His wife,Dolley, the first truly trendsetting first lady, loved ice cream, and legend has it that she was responsible for popularizing the dessert in America.
Her favorite flavor?Oyster.
Yum?Abraham LincolnHonest Abe.
The Rail-Splitter.
The Great Emancipator.
Partier-in-Chief?
Maybe it’s time to reconsider the reputation of the 16thpresident, because few in Washington, DC, have ever partied like they partied at Lincoln’ssecond inaugural ball.
The, uh, festive crowd of 4,000 attacked the 250-feet-long buffet table and soon the “floor…was…sticky, pasty and oily with wasted confections, mashed cake, and debris of fowl and meat.” Why the carnage?
Perhaps the almonds in theburnt almondice cream were too burnt?
Or… were they not burnt enough?Gerald FordIn popular culture, Gerald Ford is best (some would argueunfairly) known for being a klutz.
If you dig a little deeper into his biography, however, you’ll find something else: a nearly heroic devotion tobutter pecan ice cream.
After the presidency, whenever he visited his hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan, his aides would make sure that some butter pecan would always be on hand.
Every night he’d say, “I’ll bet there is a little ice cream in the fridge, isn’t there?” And he’d be right.Ronald ReaganSay what you want about Ronald Reagan, but the man knew what he was talking about when it came to ice cream.
A “nutritious and wholesome food”?
Definitely.
With “a reputation as the perfect dessert and snack food”?
You bet!
Those words are taken from hisproclamationestablishing July as, wait for it, National Ice Cream Month.
Also boosting his ice cream cred: he named our ownBen and JerryUS Small Business Persons of the Year in 1988!Bill ClintonAs president, Bill Clinton was known as a man of great appetites, but in recent years he has made a few changes, including going vegan.

And we know that W. himself had a complicated relationship withpretzels, but what were his feelings about ice cream?
What was his favorite flavor?
Finally, at a campaign stop in 2006, we learned the unexpected answer:pralines and cream!
George W. Bush’s visit ensured that praline and cream flew over the counter at that Pennsylvania ice cream shop for weeks and weeks.Barack ObamaSo far as we’ve been able to determine, President Obama is the only president to have ever worked the counter at anice cream shop.
Scooping, scooping, and more scooping: that was his first job, back when he was 16 and living in Honolulu.…Joe BidenWe know, we know,Joe Bidenis a vice president, not a president, but we can’t allow a mere technicality like that to keep someonewho loves ice cream so muchfrom this list.

Trump was sworn in as the president of the United States in a peaceful transition of power.
The past eight years under President Barack Obama have been rocky at times, but whether you liked him or support his successor or not, his term has finally come to an end and the era of President Trump has officially begun.Ideologically, these two presidents couldn’t be more different, but their dissimilarities don’t stop at their political beliefs — they carry over to their dietary preferences.
Through the Affordable Care Act, the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, and the White House garden, Obama and former First Lady Michelle encouraged Americans to pay more attention to their diets.
Obama eats a variety of vegetables from the White House garden (or, well, he used to), along with fruits, nuts, salmon, and just the occasional cheeseburger.
According to his last physical, Obama is 6 feet tall, weighs 175 pounds, and is in excellent overall health.Trump’s diet, however, is more reflective of the way the general American public eats.
He has proudly articulated a love of fast food, especially McDonald’s, KFC, and Wendy’s, because he proclaims that these foods are guaranteed to be safe from any contaminants.
He has been conspicuously silent aboutChipotle.)
Trump also has a strange obsession with calories and carbs.
He’s been known to scrape off and eat the cheese and other toppings from his pizza and ignore the dough (how very un-New York of him), and he drinks a lot of Diet Coke.
A letter from his personal physician shows that Trump is on the border of being overweight and obese, but, despite this, his physician said “he would be the healthiest person ever elected president.”Here are the eating habits of Presidents Obama and Trump, compared.Obama’s Inauguration Menusnapzdc / FlickrObama’s 2009 inauguration lunch menu featured dishes inspired by the winter season and the bicentenary of Abraham Lincoln’s birth.
It includedstew of sea scallops, shrimp, lobster, and cod in a cream sauce, baked in a terrine covered with puff pastry; then came a winter vegetable medley and a  “brace of American birds,” such as duck and pheasant.
Dessert was a cinnamon-apple sponge cake.Trump’s Inauguration MenuGarry Knight / FlickrTrump’s inauguration menuembodies the new president with a selection of his personal favorite foods.
The full menu includes Maine lobster and gulf shrimp served with saffron sauce and peanut crumble; Angus beef with dark chocolate and juniper jus; and chocolate soufflé with cherry vanilla ice cream.Obama’s Favorite Meal: CheeseburgersSimon Doggett / FlickrIf he could have only one meal for the rest of his life it would probably be a Cheddar cheeseburger.
Obama tends to indulge in these guilty pleasures when he’s on the road, but when he’s home, wife Michelleswaps in a leaner turkey burger in place of a ground beef patty.Trump’s Favorite Meal: MeatloafYelp/Kashif K.On his birthday, Trump’s sister Maryanne makes his family’s special meatloaf.
He is a fan of all types of American-inspired diner fare, but meatloaf is his ultimate favorite.Obama’s Favorite Snacks: Apples and Trail MixGetty ImagesObama needed a steady stream of energy to stay focused during his eight years in the White House.
He kept a giant bowl of apples on the Oval Office coffee table to satisfy those late-afternoon munchies.
He also had mixed nuts on hand for when he got a snack craving.Trump’s Favorite Snacks: Oreos, Cherry-Vanilla Ice Cream, See’s CandiesAssociated PressWhile on the 2016 campaign trail, Trump indulged in a number of his favorite snacks such as Oreos, cherry-vanilla ice cream, and See’s candies.Obama’s Favorite Simple Pleasure: Hawaiian Shaved IceReutersA simple dish ofshaved ice and flavored syrup is a popular dessertin Obama’s home state of Hawaii.
His typical order would be shaved ice topped with melon, cherry, or lime syrup.Trump’s Favorite Simple Pleasure: Bacon and EggsFlickrTrump is not a breakfast guy, but when he does indulge in themost important meal of the day, he opts for a simple plate of bacon andwell-done eggs.Obama’s Favorite Vegetable: Broccolishomova / iStockIn 2013, Obama told a group of student journalists that his overall favorite food (and, therefore, also his favorite vegetable) was broccoli.
Though it’s hard to believe that anyone would choose a bowl of steamed broccoli over a cheeseburger and fries, he swore it was the truth.Trump’s Favorite Vegetable: Lettuce?liz west/FlickrThere is no interview, report, or footage documenting that Trump likes any vegetables, but since he likes Big Macs and taco bowls, we can only assume that his favorite vegetable is lettuce.Obama’s Favorite Drink: Black Forest Berry Honest TeaHonest Tea FacebookApparently, Obama can’t get enough of the stuff.
His staffers always had to keep a robust supply on hand.Trump’s Favorite Drink: Diet CokeShutterstockDespite all of his indulgent eating habits, Trump is kind of a stickler for calories.

The answer might surprise you.BySophie VershbowPublished: Apr 10, 2023Save ArticleAs a journalist covering the book-publishing industry, when an editor reaches out to me about a story, it’s usually because there’s something dark lurking under the cover.
The (now failed)Penguin Random House/Simon & Schustermerger was a messy game of corporate maneuvers with the potential to leave employees and authors in the dust.TheNew York Timesbest-seller listis calculated with a secret formula that authors and publishers regularly attempt to cheat.I usually have anonymous sources falling all over themselves to spill industry secrets, so you can imagine that when I was assigned to investigate the methodology behind Barack Obama’s annual lists of book recommendations, I set out to expose a secret apparatus of industry shenanigans.
What I found was much more shocking.President Barack Obama released his first official list of book recommendations in summer 2009, a few months after taking office.
He continued to share summer reading recommendations throughout his presidency, with the exception of 2012 and 2013, when one can imagine he was swept up in his day job.
In 2017, after leaving office and undoubtedly regaining some free time for leisure reading, the former president also began releasing a best-books-of-the-year list, alongside similar roundups for movies, television, and music.For some, Obama’s recommendations have become highly anticipated.
Julianne Buonocore, founder of the book and lifestyle blogThe Literary Lifestyle, said that she and her 800,000+ monthly readers eagerly await Obama’s book list each year.
First, it’s exciting to see which books you’ve read that a former president has read too, and second, he always offers an array of diverse reads, so you know you’re also bound to find something new and impactful to read next,” Buonocore said.Obama shopping at Politics and Prose, an independent bookseller in Washington, D.C.JIM WATSON//Getty ImagesAlthough the lists are generally well received among anyone not naturally inclined to hate Barack Obama for unrelated political reasons, not everyone believes the authenticity of his recommendations.
I do not think the list is entirely real, in that he actually sits down and reads all these books and then chooses his favorites,” said Grace Astrove,bookstagrammerand director of development at Magazzino Italian Art.
I think he does read, of course, but with his schedule and responsibilities, there’s just no way.
It seems more likely that the highly curated list is put together from his team’s suggestions, and then they all work to choose the best ones that correspond with his important agenda or other trends happening in the world.”For skeptics like Astrove, there’s the looming question of whose influence impacts Obama’s selections.
Sources I spoke to in the publishing industry were quick to distance themselves from the insinuation that they play any role in it.
When asked whether they pitch books to the former president’s team for consideration, Carisa Hays, vice president, director of publicity at Random House Publishing Group (and Obama’s in-house publicist for his own books), responded, “The books that he chooses for his annual reading list are all his personal choices, and as a publisher we don’t influence his choices.
His choices are his own.”Random House, as well as the other publishers I reached out to, declined to comment on whether or not they’ve ever pitched a book to Obama for consideration.
Still, it’s hard to imagine that any publicist with the opportunity to get their book into the hands of the former president doesn’t try.
Given the lucrative boost in sales and publicity that an Obama pick would no doubt confer, why wouldn't they?Eric Schultz, who was a senior advisor and deputy press secretary to President Obama, says that emails from book publicists have “no bearing on what he chooses to read and release as part of his reading list.” Rather, Obama’s taste “is a reflection of the inputs he has.” When pressed, Schultz was adamant that those who suspect the former president of outsourcing his recommendations are misguided.
While Schultz freely admits that staff members contribute to planning the announcements and creating promotional elements like social-media graphics, he said, “these lists come from him.
This is not a staff-led exercise, and I think if it was, it wouldn’t pass the smell test.
These lists wouldn’t be as salient or get as much traction if it wasn’t coming from him directly.”"This is not a staff-led exercise, and I think if it was, it wouldn’t pass the smell test.
According to Schultz, the richness of Obama’s reading recommendations are a reflection of the man himself and his community.
You don’t needThe New York Times Book Reviewor Susie from book club to get recommendations when you’re constantly surrounded by some of the most interesting people in the world.
As Schultz pointed out, “Being a former president, one of the perks is access to people and communities and stories from every corner of the planet, in every industry, in every sector, in every vector… Whether it’s people in business or sports or his daughter or other friends, these are all people that he hears about books from.”The titles that Obama selects are incredibly diverse both in subjects and in authors, varying widely from the boring political tomes written by old white men that you might imagine dwelling on the nightstands of former presidents.
Of the 13 titles included in Obama’sFavorite Books of 2022, there are nine works of fiction and four works of nonfiction, including books by eight women and eight BIPOC authors.
There’s a novel about a dystopian school for mothers; a graphic novel about labor and survival in Canada; a journey through the history, rituals, and landscapes of the American South; and a beautifully crafted short-story collection.
As someone who spent the better part  of a decade working in Big Five book publishing (the five largest publishing houses: Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster, Macmillan, and Hachette), I can tell you that the former president has impeccable taste.It’s easy to imagine certain celebrity-book-club teams setting representation quotas to avoid potential Internet backlash, but according to Schultz, Obama “releases lists that are not monolithic because his actual reading diet isn’t, either.
It’s simply a reflection of what he is reading and not necessarily a check-the-box exercise or anything like that.”No one I reached out to for this story had any information that would contradict Schultz’s assertions.According to the authors I spoke with whose books have appeared on Obama’s lists of summer and end-of-year recommendations, the news came as a huge surprise.Rumaan Alam, whose novelLeave the World Behindwas on the summer 2021 list, said that when he found out, his reaction was “disbelief.”Alamsaid, “I had no idea that my book would be on this list—I was at the beach with my kids and a friend texted me saying ‘Congratulations.’ I had no idea what he was referring to—but what a wonderful surprise.”View full post on InstagramForNew Yorkerstaff writer Patrick Radden Keefe, the shock of landing on Obama’s list has come not once but twice—a not uncommon occurrence among the former president’s presumed favorite authors, such asEmily St. John Mandel(author ofThe Glass Hotel,listed in 2020, andSea of Tranquility,listed in 2022) and Colson Whitehead (author ofThe Underground Railroad,listed in 2016, andHarlem Shuffle,listed in 2021).“I had no inkling in advance, either time,” said Radden Keefe.
WithSay Nothing, it hadn’t even occurred to me that the book might be on the list.
Then withEmpire of Pain, I assumed there was no chance it would make the Obama list becauseSay Nothinghad.” Radden Keefe has a hunch that “the lists aren’t made by committee; it’s one guy’s reading habits, albeit a guy who reads pretty widely, is an immensely gifted writer himself, and happens to be the former president of the United States.”Having previously run social media for a Big Five book publisher, I can add that we were never told of the president’s selections in advance—something that often happened for major celebrity-book-club announcements or awards, in order for us to prepare marketing and public-relations materials.The question of how the most powerful man on the planet found time to readFates and Furiesamid major world events like the Arab Spring and the killing of Osama bin Laden is a perfectly valid reason for skepticism—the guy was and is busy!—but Schultz says Obama found time to read because he sees reading as necessary, and he makes it a priority on his schedule.
He considered [reading] part of being a good leader, part of being a good president, part of being a good father, a good husband, and a good man,” Schultz said.Obama visiting the Prairie Lights bookstore in Iowa City, Iowa.SAUL LOEB//Getty ImagesObama has echoed this sentiment throughout his career.
In a 2017 interview withThe New York Times’s then chief book critic,Michiko Kakutani,on what books mean to him (that interview’s sheer existence is proof of him prioritizing books and reading while in office), Obama shared how he loved reading as a child and rediscovered reading and writing in college and as a way to rebuild himself.
When he moved to New York City as a young man in the early 1980s, he said, books “reintroduced me to the power of words as a way to figure out who you are and what you think, and what you believe, and what’s important.”As a politician, he’s constantly placed an emphasis on the power of books to bring us together.
Schultz explains, “At his core, Barack Obama is a storyteller, and he puts enormous weight on how these authors and artists tell stories through books, music, or television and film.
He especially values stories that reflect our ideals, our hopes, our dreams, our challenges, our opportunities.”Regardless of whether the former president gets help compiling his recommendations or whether he accepts the occasional pitch from a former staffer’s book publicist, the fact that he promotes reading at all is a big win for anyone who believes in the power of books to bring us together.
At his core, Barack Obama is a storyteller.
Astrov, albeit skeptical that a president would be able to prioritize reading while in office, still gushed about how much she enjoys Obama’s annual recommendations.
Regardless of if it is real,” she said, “it is very significant and so wonderful to have an influential, male, BIPOC role model who promotes reading to millions.
The list is effective in so many ways; I don’t necessarily care how it is created.”The feeling of connection between two people who love the same book is not one often felt between ordinary citizens and high-ranking government officials, but I can honestly say that when Obama announcedLauren Groff’s achingly beautiful novelFates and Furies—my favorite book of 2015—ashisfavorite book of 2015, I felt I learned more about him as a person than I had from any profile, speech, or campaign ad.Imagining that a political consultant might have picked that book for him broke my heart, but it turns out I didn’t need to worry.
After weeks of reaching out to publishers, authors, and book insiders, I could not find a single source with knowledge that the former president’s book recommendations are engineered by anyone other than himself.
I may have set out to write an exposé, but what I found was so much more shocking: a positive publishing story filled with authenticity.For one moment, I give you permission to forget aboutbook bans,unlivable industry salaries, anddiversity problems.
For one minute, I give you permission to  be grateful that one of the most influential people on the planet makes it a priority not just to promote books but to be personally moved by them.I, for one, can’t wait to find out what he’s reading this summer.Related StoriesInside Book Twitter's Final(?)

The role of stories to unify — as opposed to divide, to engage rather than to marginalize — is more important than ever.”The Underground Railroad (Pulitzer Prize Winner) (National Book Award Winner) (Oprah's Book Club): A Novel (Hardcover)ByColson Whitehead$27.95ISBN:9780385542364Availability:Not On Our Shelves, But Available from Warehouse - Usually Delivers in 3-14 DaysPublished:Doubleday - August 2nd, 2016Add to Wish List"Well, the last novel I read was Colson Whitehead’s “The Underground Railroad.” And the reminder of the ways in which the pain of slavery transmits itself across generations, not just in overt ways, but how it changes minds and hearts."
 President Barack ObamaGilead (Oprah's Book Club): A Novel (Paperback)ByMarilynne RobinsonEmail or call for priceISBN:9780312424404Availability:Out of PrintPublished:Picador - January 10th, 2006"I struck up a friendship with [the novelist] Marilynne Robinson, who has become a good friend.
And we’ve become sort of pen pals.
I started reading her in Iowa, where “Gilead” and some of her best novels are set.
And I loved her writing in part because I saw those people every day.
And the interior life she was describing that connected them — the people I was shaking hands with and making speeches to — it connected them with my grandparents, who were from Kansas and ended up journeying all the way to Hawaii, but whose foundation had been set in a very similar setting."
 President Barack ObamaThe Three-Body Problem (The Three-Body Problem Series #1) (Paperback)ByCixin Liu,Ken Liu(Translated by)$17.99ISBN:9780765382030Availability:On Our Shelves NowPublished:Tor Books - January 12th, 2016Add to Wish List"It’s interesting, the stuff I read just to escape ends up being a mix of things — some science fiction.
For a while, there was a three-volume science-fiction novel, the “Three-Body Problem” series —Oh,Liu Cixin,who won the Hugo Award.— which was just wildly imaginative, really interesting.
It wasn’t so much sort of character studies as it was just this sweeping —It’s really about the fate of the universe.Exactly.
The scope of it was immense.
So that was fun to read, partly because my day-to-day problems with Congress seem fairly petty — not something to worry about.
Aliens are about to invade."
President Barack ObamaGone Girl: A Novel (Paperback)ByGillian Flynn$18.00ISBN:9780307588371Availability:On Our Shelves NowPublished:Ballantine Books - April 22nd, 2014Add to Wish List"There were books that would blend, I think, really good writing with thriller genres.

Barbara A. Mowat(Editor),Paul Werstine, Ph.D.(Editor)$9.99ISBN:9781501130014Availability:On Our Shelves NowPublished:Simon & Schuster - December 1st, 2015Add to Wish List"I would say Shakespeare continues to be a touchstone.
Like most teenagers in high school, when we were assigned, I don’t know, “The Tempest” or something, I thought, ‘My God, this is boring.’ And I took this wonderful Shakespeare class in college where I just started to read the tragedies and dig into them.
And that, I think, is foundational for me in understanding how certain patterns repeat themselves and play themselves out between human beings."

S. Naipaul$16.95ISBN:9780679722021Availability:On Our Shelves NowPublished:Vintage - March 13th, 1989Add to Wish List"I think that there are writers who I don’t necessarily agree with in terms of their politics, but whose writings are sort of a baseline for how to think about certain things — V. S. Naipaul, for example.
His “A Bend in the River,” which starts with the line, “The world is what it is; men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing, have no place in it.” And I always think about that line, and I think about his novels when I’m thinking about the hardness of the world sometimes, particularly in foreign policy, and I resist and fight against sometimes that very cynical, more realistic view of the world.
And yet, there are times where it feels as if that may be true."

One of the great treats of being president is, in the Lincoln Bedroom, there’s a copy of the Gettysburg Address handwritten by him, one of five copies he did for charity.
And there have been times in the evening when I’d just walk over, because it’s right next to my office, my home office, and I just read it."

Indeed, he was more interested in basketball than his subjects, the president admitted in a speech to students at Benjamin Banneker High School in Washington, D.C., Wednesday.
Now, if you promise not to tell anybody, I will let you in on a little secret: I was not always the very best student that I could be when I was in high school, and certainly not when I was in middle school.
I did not love every class I took.
I wasn’t always paying attention the way I should have,” Obama said, according toThe Hill.
I remember when I was in eighth grade I had to take a class called ethics.
Now, ethics is about right and wrong, but if you’d ask me what my favorite subject was back in eighth grade, it was basketball.
I don’t think ethics would have made it on the list.

Jeffrey| September 29, 2011 | 4:21pm EDTFont SizePresident Barack Obama spoke at Benjamin Banneker Academic High School in Washington, D.C. on Sept. 28, 2011 in his third annual 'Back to School' speech.
CNSNews.com/Penny Starr)(CNSNews.com) - President Barack Obama told an audience of high school students in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday that he was “not always the very best student” and that ethics “would not have made it on the list” of his favorite subjects.“I was not always the very best student that I could be when I was in high school, and certainly not when I was in middle school,” Obama said, speaking at Benjamin Banneker Academic High School.“I did not love every class I took.

I don’t think ethics would have made it on the list.”If the player does not load, please check that you are running the latest version of Adobe Flash Player.Obama went on to tell the high school students that even though that 8th grade ethics class was not one of his favorites it did have a significant impact on his life—and now inspires the way he acts as president.“I still remember that ethics class, all these years later,” Obama said.
I remember the way it made me think.
I remember being asked questions like: What matters in life?
Or, what does it mean to treat other people with dignity and respect?
What does it mean to live in a diverse nation, where not everybody looks like you do, or thinks like you do, or comes from the same neighborhood as you do?
How do we figure out how to get along?“Each of these questions led to new questions,” said Obama.
And I didn’t always know the right answers, but those discussions and that process of discovery--those things have lasted.
Those things are still with me today.
Every day, I’m thinking about those same issues as I try to lead this nation.”Obama attended 5th through 12th grade at the Punahou School in Hawaii.
The K-12 schooldescribes itselfas “an independent college preparatory day school.”Onits website, it cites as the first element of its mission: “To provide an environment where students can: Develop moral and spiritual values consistent with the Christian principles on which Punahou was founded, affirming the worth and dignity of each individual.”The Benjamin Banneker Academic High School where Obama spoke about the ethics he was taught in 8th grade at his private college preparatory school is a public school.donatemrc merchThe mission of the Media Research Center is to document and combat the falsehoods and censorship of the news media, entertainment media and Big Tech in order to defend and preserve America's founding principles and Judeo-Christian values.

It takes a strong ethical backbone to give a man a fair trial while being accused of a serious crime.

Kudos Barack for being a person and not a weird geeky robot (at least back then).Also, in a security/war situation, the rules for due process change--Al-Awlaki simply couldn't get the standard due process for an American citizen apprehended in the United States.
He had a different, but no less justified and legal, form of due process.
Read the Constitution--the executive and legislature are the fora for due process in war-time, and to argue that this wasn't a war-strike is naive and silly.00Report PostRusty ShacklefordRusty ShacklefordAnonymous PosterReport User#711 years ago10/01/2011 2:17pm EDTre:end government greedReplyBack To IndexForum IndexOh my god, a 14 year old preferred playing sports to sitting in class?!

Obama's favorite food?
It's broccoli, kids!NewsSportsEntertainmentBusinessOpinionAdvertiseObituarieseNewspaperLegalsPOLITICSObama's favorite food?
It's broccoli, kids!Staff WriterThe Columbus DispatchWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama likes burgers, hot dogs and such, but when it came time to answer a kid journalist's question about his favorite food, broccoli was the first word that sprang from his lips.This revelation came yesterday at a White House event that recognized children who won a healthy recipe contest, as part of first lady Michelle Obama's anti-obesity campaign.Having fun with the children, Obama agreed to take two questions from the journalists among them.
The first asked what was Obama's favorite food.
Broccoli was the presidential reply, according to a White House aide.This from a politician who has literally eaten his way across the country: burgers in a Washington suburb with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev; ribs in Asheville, N.C.; hot dogs at a basketball game in Dayton; and a tasty pastry called a kringle in Wisconsin.Obama's disclosure puts him starkly at odds with the culinary tastes of George H.W.
Bush, who as president famously declared his dislike for broccoli.
And I haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it.
And I'm president of the United States, and I'm not going to eat any more broccoli!"
Bush said in 1990.Steamed broccoli growers shipped thousands of pounds of broccoli to the White House in protest, and the vegetable was farmed out to homeless shelters.Obama clearly was enjoying the spirit of the anti-obesity event, called the "Kids' State Dinner," which recognized winning recipes such as "picky eater pita pizza pockets" and "sweet potato turkey sliders.
Food can be fun.
It can be healthy," Obama said.
You are setting up habits that are going to be great your entire life.
He joked that he's not much of a cook.
In) my family, when they cooked vegetables, they were all boiled."
Since then, he said, he has learned that healthy food can also taste good.CareersStaff DirectoryAccessibilitySite MapLegalsOur Ethical PrinciplesSubscription Terms & ConditionsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact UsSupport Local BusinessAdvertise Your BusinessAdvertising Terms and ConditionsPromote your EventLicensing & ReprintsHelp CenterSubscriber GuideMy AccountGive FeedbackPromote Your EventSubscribe TodayNewslettersFacebookTwitterInstagrameNewspaperArchivesThisWeek News ArchivesJobsCarsHomesClassifiedsReviewed.com10BestEventsLocaliQ Digital Marketing SolutionsUSA TODAY Sports+© 2023 www.dispatch.com.

This redemption comes more than two decades after President George H.W.
Bush declared thathe didn’t like broccoliand was not going to eat it anymore.Obama briefly stopped by the Kids’ State Dinner, hosted by First Lady Michelle Obama.
One kid journalist at the event asked the president what his favorite food was, and broccoli was the answer.
PHOTOS: 7 dogs that Obama ate)Bush coming out against broccoli was not the only time the vegetable has been a talking point in the political world.
When Obamacare was being debated in the Supreme Court in 2010, the question of whether the government couldmandatethat Americans eat a certain amount of broccoli because it is healthy was argued.There is a question, however, as to whether Obama’s love of broccoli is new.
During the 2012 election, Scholasticcitedthe commander in chief’s favorite foods as chili, french fries and pork chops.
Obama has also talked about his love ofnachos, his favorite junk food.Perhaps the president’s new found love of broccoli came from learning new ways to cook it?

If not entirely true, Obama's response was at least tactful: theevent was focused on healthy cooking and eating.AdvertisementWhile Obama claimed to love broccoli now, he also admitted he wasn't the kind of kid who just chowed down willingly on veggies by pretending he was a giant eating trees.“My family when they cooked vegetables, they would just boil them and they’d get all soft and mushy,” Obama recalled,according to the Washington Post.
Nobody wanted to eat a pea or a Brussels sprout because they’d be all mushy.”Still, Obama's response is more believable than it would be coming out of the mouth of former President George H.W.
Bush.
In 1990, Bushrecalled his childhood while explaining reports that he'd banned broccoli aboard Air Force One.
I do not like broccoli,'' he said.
And I haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it.
And I'm President of the United States, and I'm not going to eat any more broccoli!

It drew a batch of more than 1,300 entries that were whittled to 54 winners – one from each of the 50 states, three territories and the District of Columbia.Mrs.

The couple’s book box has been a fixture of the Lower Pacific Heights neighborhood for a decade.
With the support of neighbors, the Meyerses protested the edict.“[Ms. Meyers] is looking to help future Little Free Library stewards who want to put up a Little Free Library lending box, but might be scared to, or nervous to, because of the fines that could be incurred,” says Margret Aldrich, director of communications for Little Free Library, a nonprofit organization.Since 2009, more than 150,000 Little Free Libraries have sprung up in 120 countries – most recently in Afghanistan.
The concept behind them is simple: Take a free book, but, in turn, replace it with another.
The miniature libraries typically abut sidewalks.
They range from birdhouse-size cabinets, to decommissioned British phone booths, to a hollowed-out cottonwood tree in Idaho that is big enough to walk into.
The number of new Little Free Libraries surged during the pandemic.“Folks were looking for a way to connect with their neighbors,” says Ms. Aldrich in a phone call.
It’s kind of showing that we’re all in this together, even when we have to be apart.”Some neighbors have also banded together to distribute books that their local libraries have boycotted.
Last year, HarperCollins dispatched 1,000 banned books to Little Free Libraries.Following an outcry about the costly permit for the Meyerses’ dollhouselike bookcase, several San Francisco city agencies promised to revise rules that impact Little Free Libraries.Although some U.S. cities cracked down on the boxes when they started popping up, that’s rarer now.
Observes Ms. Aldrich, “Enough people know what the concept is and the positive outcomes that can happen in a community because of the Little Free Library.”Listen to or read today's issueRegionsAfricaAmericasAsia PacificEuropeMiddle EastSouth & Central AsiaUSAAll WorldRecent StoriesHigh court, low accountability: How Thomas scandal threatens Supreme CourtJustice Dept.

That can't be true.
Broccoli is no one's favorite food.APBarack Obama's favorite food is broccoli, or so he told a child at the White House Kids' "State Dinner" on Tuesday.Loading...ByJames NortonCorrepsondentJuly 10, 2013If there ever was a time for the chief executive to be dishonest, this might have been it: When asked at aWhite Houseevent for children who had won a healthy recipe contest what his favorite food is,President Obama replied: "Broccoli.
Broccoli is no one's favorite food unless it's covered in cheese, in which case "cheese" is really your favorite food.
It's not particularly flavorful, even for a vegetable.
Again, even among its kin, it's kind of dull.
Most critically: it triggers exactly zero of the caveman-era pleasure centers in our brain, contributing no rare and precious fat, or sugar, or salt.
Ask a vegan about his or her favorite food and you'd get a more plausible answer than "broccoli."
Naturally,Twitterhas gone absolutely bananas with tart skepticism.That said, the president is a politician and a member of government, both positions that make the dispensing of absolute truth difficult, if not an outright liability.
And it's plain to see the advantages of praising broccoli, particularly in these circumstances: Had he given any of the far, far more believable answers of "a Five Guys hamburger," or "chicken-fried steak," or "kringle," he'd be breaking the hearts of healthy recipe-concocting kids everywhere, not to mention undermining the First Lady's work to cultivate healthier eating habits among Americans everywhere.More plausible but still productively dishonest answers might have included:Any fruit – seriously, how hard would that have been?
An apple, an orange, a banana – things that are good for us, and thanks to naturally occurring fructose, are also quite tasty.
Go exotic and make some waves: kiwi, starfruit, even durian.
In fact: try avoiding processed sugar for a week and come back to fruit with a re-sensitized palate.
It's absolutely delicious!Marketplace of ideas?
Why neither side is buying anymore.On second thought, not durian, which smells and tastes like mango mixed with onions and the smell of feet.Veggie burgers – a good bean-based veggie burger patty can be absolutely delicious, and you can perpetrate all manner of flummery on the bun and toppings to make it a truly balanced and healthy meal.
By jamming the word "burger" into the title, you've helped sell your story, particularly to non-careful readers, which is to say a large percentage of the general public.Sushi – Four years ago, this answer would have risked bringing down the wrath of anti-snob pseudo-populists on your head (and, indeed, some of the commentariat would still use this as an excuse to paint the chief executive as out of touch, probably just before keeping their lunch reservations at the precious little farm-to-table place downtown.)
But their criticisms wouldn't resonate.
Sushi is everywhere these days, and both its raw fish and vegetable-driven incarnations are light, intensely flavorful, and totally delicious.
It'd be a bold move, but it could be sold.Get stories thatempower and upliftdaily.By signing up, you agree to ourPrivacy Policy.Already a subscriber?Log in to hide ads.Vegetarian chili – The beauty of chili is that it's essentially a medium that takes on the flavor of its herbs and spices – that medium doesn't have to be greasy meat, or meat at all, and it'll still taste absolutely delicious.
I'm a personal fan of vegan taco mix for this exact reason.
Still, if the kids asked me what my favorite food is, I'd say: "A ribeye steak fromEverett's, seasoned with salt and pepper and grilled medium rare over lump charcoal on my Weber in my backyard."

Decoder can stump you!Share this articleCopy linkLink copied.×Mark SappenfieldEditorDear Reader,About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review – under the charming heading of “do things that don’t interest you”:“Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight.
My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier.
Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.”If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it.
We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest.
We’re the bran muffin of journalism.But you know what?
We change lives.
And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in.The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out.
We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people.

That email doesn't look right.By adding your email you agree to get updates about Spoon University HealthierWhether Michelle was campaigning against childhood obesity or Barack was enjoying a slice of pie on his birthday, the Obamas knew how to have a good time with food.
In fact, Michelle Obama even took it upon herself to better what kids eat and prove that exercise can be fun as part of her first-lady initiative.The Obamas have always put smiles on our faces, so now it's time to relive the goofiest and most influential moments of the Obama administration while simultaneously celebrating what we love best:food.#SpoonTip: FLOTUS stands for "First Lady of the United States" and POTUS stands for "President of the United States."
It's fitting that this awesome couple have nicknames that are just as cool as they are.White House GardenSoon after Obama entered office, Michelle planted her own White House vegetable garden.
This patch on the South Lawn provided food for the First Family as well as the Food Bank Organization.
There are 55 varieties of vegetables grown there such as arugula, black kale, and tomatillos along with various fruits.
Michelle has even secured private funding for the patch and has made sure the National Park Service willcontinue her legacyeven after she leaves the White House.
Turnip for What"Michelle Obama became famous on Vine after she created a video parody of DJ Snake and Lil Jon's song "Turn Down for What."
In light of her love for vegetables, she turned this clubbing song into one that even kids can enjoy: "Turnip for What."
It may be a bit cheesy, but we still love you and your food-filled puns, Mrs. Obama.#SpoonTip: This is Cristeta Comerford, the White House chef since 2005.
Inspired by Michelle's video, in this photo she is seen making a healthy curry turnip recipe.HHFKAThe Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Actwas one of the first programs started by Michelle Obama to create better meal options at schools.
We may not like that candy and ice cream can no longer be sold for fundraisers, but in the end, the FLOTUS is just working for our health's best interests.French Fries at Buckingham PalaceMichelle appears practically flawless when it comes to healthy eating, but in reality, she can admit to having a few guilty pleasures like the rest of us.
In fact, one moment she remembers most is when sheordered French fries while visiting Buckingham Palacein London.Luckily, they were worth the indulgence at one of the fanciest places around.
She'll also occasionally enjoy those fried goodies on the couch watching her favorite TV shows with Bo, the family dog.
Sounds a bit like you and me!
Let's Move"CampaignStarting in February of 2010, Michelle Obama introduced her plan to combat childhood obesity.
This campaign combines the importance of being active with plans to eat healthier.
All across the country, Michelle's work has motivated parents to raisehealthier childrenand has taught kids that playing outdoors can indeed be fun.Not only that, but the campaign also supports healthier school lunches as well as supporting local gardens, such as the one pictured above.
This has been a trademark of the Obama administration, and future generations will thank them for setting us on a path to live healthier lives.
Broccoligate"At the second annualKids' State Dinner, Barack Obama was asked by the children attending what his favorite food was.
The answer he came up with: broccoli!
The kids were astonished, how could someone's favorite food be broccoli?!
This took Twitter by storm and went by the name of"Broccoligate.
Obama backed up his response by saying that broccoli was one vegetable that his whole family liked, which is why it is one of his favorites.
If this is the only scandal the Obamas have been through then that's not too shabby.First to Brew Beer in the White HouseObama was the first president tobrew beer in the White House.
Starting in January of 2011, Barack purchased a home-brewing kit and got to work.
Using honey produced from the White House's very own beehive, he has managed to create two phenomenal brews: a Honey Porter and a White House Honey Brown Ale.Obama's love of good beer runs deep, so much that he even had one named after him in North Carolina.
Asheville Brewing Company crafted"President's Spring Break Ale"just for the POTUS himself.
If you're interested, therecipes for his own brewsare actually online!Pie vs. CakeBarack celebrates his birthday on August 4th.
Some may expect him to receive a ten-layer cake filled with every flavor imaginable.
However, this President prefers a good old-fashioned slice of American pie.In fact, any pie that Bill Yosses, the White House pastry chef (2007-2014), baked, Obama would soon devour.
The"Crustmaster"got Obama so hooked he was convinced they were filled with crack!
Well, not really, but they were pretty addicting.
So in this big cake vs. pie debate, Obama sides on the side of a slice of pie.In a few short months, he won't be our president anymore, but we'll always remember the Obamas for their laughs, life-changing programs, and of course, their encounters with food.

Never Be Flat.
Always Be Natural.
That saying is forever etched in my brain because it sat on a placard atop the piano where I took lessons every week for years.
This part dad joke and part music insider’s joke never made me laugh because I tended to stare at it while I was lectured about misplaying notes or not having practiced enough during the previous week.But when I was reminded a few weeks ago that March is “Music in Our Schools Month,” I immediately thought about my favorite music teachers over the years.
At the top of the list is my mom, a 40-year veteran elementary school music teacher.
She passed along a strong music gene that had me playing four instruments at one point in life (although not all at the same time!).
She brought endless ideas on how to spark a lifelong curiosity in music.Music is found throughout the National Archives.
Many may know the famous sound recordings and motion pictures across the decades, but it’s the letters from the Revolution, Civil War, and Vietnam to light-hearted moments by familiar elected officials that surprise us.
The history of our nation has an incredible score.In this issue, we’re highlighting Presidents who took their music education all the way into the Oval Office with tuneful images and records from the Archives.Patrick MaddenExecutive DirectorNational Archives FoundationPS – Q: What do you call ten bassoons at the bottom of the ocean?
A: A good start.

A: Everyone is relieved when the case is closed.
Trust me, I’ve got a million of them.Tickling the IvoriesLauren Bacall on Piano with Vice President Harry S. TrumanSource: Truman LibraryThe thirty-fourth President of the United States, Harry S. Truman was a lifelong piano player who, as a boy, had risen at five every morning to practice.
He enjoyed playing the instrument for the rest of his life.When he became Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Vice President, Truman often attended events on behalf of U.S. troops.
He got himself into hot water in February 1945, when he entertained servicemen by playing the piano at the National Press Club Canteen and actress Lauren Bacall climbed atop the instrument.
His wife, Bess Truman, was not amused.Truman Plays PianoSource: Truman LibraryStill, Harry Truman continued to play whenever he got the chance.
In this photo, he is playing an instrument that the Piano Manufacturers Association presented to him at the White House in honor of National Music Week.Source: Nixon LibraryPresident Richard Nixon was many things to many people, but one thing few people remember about him is that he played five musical instruments—the saxophone, the violin, the clarinet, the accordion, and the piano.
The latter was the instrument he played most often.
He practiced it steadily throughout his childhood, and by adulthood, he played very well.
He even composed a piano concerto.
He played “My Wild Irish Rose” in honor of his wife Pat at the Grand Ole Opry, and at the White House, he played “Happy Birthday” for Duke Ellington at the White House.
He also accompanied Pearl Bailey at the White House.
Not bad for a guy who never learned to read music!The Family BandUVA students pose as Jefferson and his violin teacherNational Archives Identifier: 135804690Several Presidents have played the violin, but undoubtedly the best-known is Thomas Jefferson, who studied the instrument from a young age.
When he entered the College of William & Mary at Williamsburg, Virginia, at the age of sixteen, he spent much of his first year going to parties and spending too much money, but in his second year, he buckled down, studying fifteen hours a day and concentrating on his French, Greek, and violin studies.I have began a beautiful tune with balbastre, done a very pretty landskip with Pariseau, a little man playing on the violin, and began another beautiful landskape.Read the full letter to Thomas Jefferson from Martha Jefferson, 8 [March] 1787Source: NARA’s Founders OnlineJefferson continued to study and play the violin well into his old age, and he insisted that his daughters and granddaughters study music as well.
Many years later, in 1820, he told his friend John Dix, “I wish I had learned to play on the harpsichord, as my fingers are too stiff for the violin, for in that case I might have amused myself in my old age.” Perhaps when he said that, he was remembering Martha, who was quite a proficient harpsichord player.Read the full entry in John A. Dix’s Memoir of his Monticello Visit, 19 February 1820Source: NARA’s Founders OnlineCandidate Jam SessionA saxophone given to President Bill ClintonSource: Clinton LibraryIn June 1992, William Jefferson Clinton was running for President against incumbent President George H. W. Bush and independent Ross Perot.
He was an upstart, a newcomer, and he needed to set himself apart from the other two candidates, so he and his team booked an appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show, a talk show hosted by the namesake actor, comedian, writer, and producer.
Hall’s show appealed to the young people that Clinton wanted to attract to the polls.Bill Clinton plays saxophone at 40th anniversary of the Newport Jazz FestivalNational Archives Identifier: 2524242President Clinton with his saxophone in the Music RoomNational Archives Identifier: 183373996On the night of June 3, 1992, when Arsenio Hall took the stage, on the bandstand to his right stood candidate Bill Clinton, wearing a bright yellow and blue tie and wraparound Ray-Ban Wayfarers and clutching his tenor saxophone.
Backed by Hall’s band, Clinton launched into “Heartbreak Hotel.” His performance and his conversation thereafter with Hall immediately recast Clinton as a cool, hip, wise candidate who spoke to the issues that young people were concerned about.
Despite complaints from the press and other politicians that Clinton’s appearance was “not Presidential,” that moment changed the way political campaigns would be run for good.
And the Clinton campaign definitely succeeded in attracting new voters, most notably young voters, to the polls in the fall of 1992, when Clinton soundly defeated both Bush and Perot.When he got to the White House, Clinton added a music room in the private residence.Practice Makes Perfect“Drizzling, misty weather all day.
Did not stir out of the house.
Amused myself with reading, writing, and taking lessons on the flute; which I have lately begun to learn.”John Quincy Adams wrote in his diary on April 19, 1786This might not seem like an unusual notation, except perhaps that Adams was already nineteen when he began studying the flute—a little older, perhaps, than most beginning musicians.Born on July 11, 1767, John Quincy Adams was one of our most accomplished Presidents.
He was exceptionally well educated, having traveled with his father, John Adams, for several years in Europe on diplomatic missions while he was still quite a young man.
At the age of fourteen, he accompanied diplomat Francis Dana to Russian, returning to England with his father in 1783 and then to the United States in 1785 to complete his education.
He graduated from Harvard University and then opened his own law practice.
He is reported to have spoken eight languages.And throughout his life, he recorded in the diary that he kept until just before his death in 1848 that he continued to practice the flute and play it to entertain his guests.
In a time when people had to depend on themselves for entertainment, John Quincy Adams was prepared to rise to the task.Track the progress of his flute lessons here:Receives a new flute as a gift from a friend“No reciting this morning.
Cranch went to Boston, bought me a flute.
We had a Lecture from Mr. Williams, upon Motion proceeding from Gravity.
Williams, the Professor’s son, made tea for the Club; I was a great part of the Evening, taking off, extracts from the morning Lecture.”5 April 1786Becomes skilled enough to play with friends“Mr.
Cranch went to Boston.
Miss P. Storer, N. Quincy and B. Apthorp, pass’d the afternoon, we play’d on the flute, on the harpsichord, and sung.
There is always some fine music of one kind or another, going forward in this House.
Betsey, and Miss Hiller finger the harpsichord Billy scrapes the Violin, Charles and myself blow the flute.
Parson Wibird, was here all the evening.”17 July 1786Does an hour-long performance at a friend’s home“A number of us spent the evening at Dr. Swett’s.
I play’d on the flute, an hour or so.”29 February 1788Killer PipesVisit the Obama Archivesfor a full recap of“In Performance atthe White House:Red, White and Blues”President Barack Obama didn’t play an instrument, but he is musical, nevertheless.
On several occasions, he has burst into song, to the delight of his audience.
At a campaign stop at the famous Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York, on January 19, 2021, he acknowledged that famed soul singer the Reverend Al Green was in the audience.
He then sang the first line of one of Green’s greatest hits, “Let’s Stay Together”: “I am so in love with you.
. . .”A month later, on February 22, the President and Mrs. Obama hosted a night of blues music at the White House.
As the all-star group, which included B.
B.
King, Mick Jagger, Keb Mo, Jeff Beck, and Trombone Shorty, took the stage for the finale, the President joined them and sang a few lines of “Sweet Home Chicago.”Source: The Obama White House YouTubeAbout the FoundationMissionBoard of DirectorsStaffJobsAnnual Reports/990sAchievement & Heritage AwardsSecurity & Privacy PolicyAbout the ArchivesContact UsNational Archives Foundation700 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, DC 20408-0001202-357-5946HomeVisitLearnSupportEventsNewsShopAboutJobsArchives.govAboutContactWays To GiveDonate©2023 National Archives Foundation

Through the years, commanders-in-chief have turned musicians-in-chief, with varying results.Credit: APByTHE ASSOCIATED PRESSJanuary 20, 2012ShareIs it too much to ask our presidents to uphold the Constitution, command the armed forces, execute the nation's laws — AND provide us with a little musical interlude?The question comes to mind in the wake ofBarack Obama's appearance at theApollo Theater, when the leader of the free world took a moment to channel the Rev.Al Green, singing a bar from "Let's Stay Together."
The crowd (and admirers on the Internet) went nuts, reacting in a way they rarely do to, say, a veto message or aThanksgivingProclamation.Obama, of course, is not the first president to show his tuneful side to the public.
Through the years, commanders-in-chief have turned musicians-in-chief, with varying results.Among them:—RICHARD NIXON.
He was noBilly Joel.
And yet twice in 1974, in the last months of his doomed administration, the President Who Was Not a Crook became the President Who Was the Piano Man.
He played "God Bless America" at the Grand Ole Opry, and the same tune when he accompanied singerPearl Baileyin the East Room of the White House.
The two also conspired on "Home on the Range" and "Wild Irish Rose."
You don't play as well as I sing,"Baileyjoked, "but I don't sing as well as you govern."
She was half right.Get the Breaking News newsletter!Get the latest breaking news as it happens.Sign upBy clicking Sign up, you agree to ourprivacy policy.Nixon also appeared on TV with Jack Paar in 1963, and played a little concerto of his own devising.
Nixon said this would put the kibosh on his political career: "TheRepublicansdon't want to another piano player in the White House," he said.—HARRY TRUMAN.
Nixon was referring to "Give 'em Hell Harry," aDemocratwho could never pass a piano without sitting down to play a few bars.
In 1952, Truman conducted a nationally televised tour of the newly renovated White House and played a bit on the 1938 Steinway.
The building had been condemned when a leg of piano played by his daughter Margaret, a singer whose talent was of some dispute, crashed through the floor of the decrepit mansion.Truman also played forJoseph StalinandWinston Churchillat the Potsdam Conference, neither shortening nor lengtheningWorld War IIappreciably.
The man did love the piano: "My choice early in life was either to be a piano-player in a whorehouse or a politician," he once said.
And to tell the truth, there's hardly any difference.
THOMAS JEFFERSON.
He played the violin, and not just to meet women (though that is how he came to know his harpsichord-playing wife, Martha).
When he wasn't writing the Declaration of Independence or rewriting the Bible or inventing a four-sided music stand for string quartets, he made music.
He played the cello and clavichord, but the violin was his instrument, and he was a ringer for several orchestras.
Though often in need of money, he always refused payment.—BILL CLINTON.William Jefferson Clinton, not yet president, took a giant step in that direction in June 1992 when he showed up with a saxophone and wraparound sunglasses to play "Heartbreak Hotel" on "TheArsenio HallShow."
It's nice to see aDemocratblow something besides the election," quipped the host.After he won the presidency,Clintonplayed withE Street BandsaxophonistClarence Clemonsat aninauguralball.
He also took a moment from an East European tour in 1994 to climb the stage ofPrague's Reduta Jazz Club and play "My Funny Valentine" and "Summertime."
At one point he invited Czech leaderVaclav Havelto join him; this would be remembered in political and musical history as the Two Presidents Gig.—Many other chief executives performed, though not necessarily in public.John Quincy Adamsplayed the flute, Chester Arthur the banjo, Woodrow Wilson the violin.Franklin Rooseveltliked to sing.
AndJohn Tyler— of "Tippecanoe and Tyler, too" fame — organized his 15 children in a White House minstrel band.
Historian Elise Kirk says this probably included banjo, bones, drums and guitar.

Did Obama Do Well in High School?
 StudyPugBlogMain siteStudyPug Essay ContestDid Obama Do Well in High School?Whenever a skilled and talented individual reaches the pinnacle of success and is under the spotlight, everyone else becomes interested with that person’s story and how he/she got there.
Most people would think that there must have been some rare cosmic event or a miraculous series of events that brought about such a success, but that usually isn’t the case.In a lot of cases, it usually begins from a background that is quite ordinary and even mundane.Take the case ofBarack Obama, the President of the United States of America.
He is the first non-white American to hold the position, and he has been serving two consecutive terms.Image via HuffpostHis administration has been both celebrated and controversial, depending on which side of the fence you’re looking from.
How the world have come to know him as a household name is mostly from his ability to captivate audiences with his oratory brilliance.While he may seem like a stalwart of all things great in today’s world, his beginnings are not that extraordinary.
While his origins are more or less unusual, he as a youth wasn’t that special.Obama studied in Punahou School, a private school in Honolulu, Hawaii, from 5th to 12th grade, graduating in 1979.
Looking back, his stay there wasn’t anything remarkable.
Some may even say that he may not have deserved to be there, having beenadmitted with the help of his grandfather’s bosswho was an alum of the school.His academic performance was far from spectacular.
He was a B student who also got a D in eighth-grade French.
His priorities were more focused on parties, going to the beach, and playing basketball.He was on the basketball team that went on to win the state championship in his senior year, but his coach didn’t start him.
He also played defensive line on Punahou’s football team in his freshman year, so he was definitely athletic even back then.Image via AmazonawsBarry, as he was called back then, was generally well-liked and seemed content, but his mixed heritage meant that he didn’t have a good idea of his own identity and where his true passions lied.He went through the various phases commonly experienced by most adolescent males, having experimented with various activities and taken up vices that may have not been recommended for any respectable young man.Despite his middling academic performance, professors did comment on his untapped potential, which would then prove to be true.He grew up in a middle class family, so he wasn’t up against big struggles that are usually characteristic of stories like this.
In fact, most may think of his story early on as rather unremarkable and even one to frown upon for more ambitious and high-strung individuals.But then again, for a lot of people who go on to become successful in life, not all of them were overachievers to begin with.It may be hard to think for some people that the eloquent and charismatic politician based in Chicago who would go on to become the President of the United States of America was actually a slacker.
But then again, so was George W. Bush, so it’s not like his case is unique for an American president, much less a particularly successful individual.If anything, it only serves to humanize his story even more and make him relatable to the average Joe.Reflecting on these formative years, he would write: “The opportunity that Hawaii offered to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect, became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.”So in short,Barack Obama did fairly alright in high school.
He wasn’t really a bad student, but he was no scholar either during that time.
He did a bit better later on in college and early in his career, where he finally found his calling in public service.He would go on to study inHarvard Law Schooland met his wife Michelle while working as an associate at a law firm.
He chose to settle in Chicago and pursued a political career.
The rest after that is history.Like the Article?

The afro he started at Punahou School had grown a bit fuller, but was under control.
He was Barry Obama, freshman, from Honolulu.
The name, along with those of his two new roommates, was typed on the index card that had been slotted on to the door of Room A104 of Haines Hall annexe in preparation for his arrival.
Maybe his face didn't look Hawaiian at first glance, thought Jeff Yamaguchi, who lived down the hall and whose family was from the islands, but it quickly became apparent that he had the easy-going attitude of a Hawaiian local, "that mannerism and style and personality that is very unique and identifiable from tourists… a mentality you develop over time, just 'Whatever.
It was autumn 1979 when Obama arrived atOccidental College, a small liberal arts college in Los Angeles.
The campus was much like his school in Honolulu, with gentle slopes and flowering landscapes.
Its academic expectations were equally high and the weather in southern California sunny.
All so familiar, but Obama had come to college in search of something more.In the end, his stay at Occidental would compose only half of his college experience.
Just two school years, when he was 18 and 19, from August 1979 to June 1981.
But in the development of the person he was to become, Occidental was significant.Obama's roommates were Paul Carpenter, a blond southern Californian who occasionally took his friends surfing (bodysurfing, in Barry's case), and Imad Husain, an intellectual Pakistani with a droll sense of humour who grew up in Karachi (though his parents now lived in Dubai) and finished his secondary education at Bedford School in the UK.
Barry Obama played a lot of Hendrix, Earth, Wind & Fire and Billie Holiday, but was known in the annexe for his wicked impression of Mick Jagger.
He could do the walk, the strut, the face.The annexe was home to African-Americans and international students from the Asian subcontinent, budding intellectuals and aspiring writers, party animals, surfer dudes and jocks.
Barry Obama represented a bit of each of them: he was black and white, surfer, basketballer, writer and perceptive observer, wholly American and yet the son of an African and intimately familiar with Asia from his years in Indonesia.
His ability to connect across racial and cultural lines was not merely a superficial art of survival but rooted in his life and being.Most of Obama's classmates could not see how hard he was working to reconcile the contradictions that life threw at him.
They thought he was cool, smart without being pedantic, and seemed to have his act together.
To Mark Parsons, who came to know him mostly because they both smoked and spent a lot of time together huddling outside the student union, Obama seemed "almost Zen in walking through all the chaos in our dorm".
He displayed one trait that showed he wanted to be a player though: he wore a lot of "stupid hats".
He usually wore them cocked, to look cool.
Obama also had a peculiar smoking style, a little affectation.
He turned his wrist up and cupped the cigarette between thumb and index finger.
He smoked a cigarette the same way he smoked a joint.
I have a sense that he smoked because he was addicted, as I was," Parsons said.
But, Obama told Parsons, there was another reason.
I remember him telling me he would quit after he got married.
He didn't want to quit smoking because he said he would gain weight, but after he got married it would be OK to gain weight.
I think it was mostly a joke.
A fellow student, Lisa Jack, an aspiringAnnie Leibovitzwho went around campus persuading interesting people to let her photograph them, recalls that a friend "started to tell me about this really good-looking guy.
His name is Barry and people are talking about him."
To have Lisa Jack shoot profiles of you was considered a mark of distinction, and Obama gladly accepted the offer.At about 11 one morning he turned up ready and eager for his photo shoot.
He was wearing flip-flops, jeans and a collared shirt with button-down breast pockets.
He brought along a pack of non-filter cigarettes, a wide-brimmed boater hat and a bomber jacket.
Jack did not instruct him on the wardrobe or accessories; they were all his idea.
He started to experiment, moving around for different poses.
It was one of those times when his ambition was unmistakable.
He blew smoke like he was on a Bob Dylan album jacket.
He put on his hat and cocked it low like he was Hendrix.
I think he was into it," Jack recalled.
He was pleased he had been asked.
In the subjects he preferred, political science and literature, Obama signed up for as many advanced courses as he could take.
In any discussion, Obama would listen to everyone else before bringing in his point of view.
Jeff Yamaguchi put it this way: "He listens and he listens and he listens, rather than respond immediately to the first thing that's out there.
It's like, 'Let's let it percolate for a little.
Let's let it simmer.'
He reads people really well.
He doesn't use the same play for every person.
He has different plays in his playbook.
He adjusts to the situation.
The four African students at Occidental called Obama their brother; he told them how much he wanted to go to Africa to see his father and his roots.
He talked to one of them, Kofi Manu, a Ghanaian, about finding an apartment in their sophomore year, but instead moved into a place with his Pakistani friend Hasan Chandoo.
Their place became a regular hangout for the Pakistanis and their friends.
It was in this company Obama felt most comfortable.
These were my closest friends," he noted decades later, during an interview in the Oval Office.
Race was not a factor.
It was an international sensibility that brought them together, Obama said.
I think there is no doubt… they were sort of world citizens, with kind of peripatetic lives.
All of them had that sort of shared characteristic of spanning cultures, which I think strengthened our friendships.
The late-night discussions he participated in now were more intense than those of his freshman year, more overtly political, more directed at America's role in the world.
Chandoo and the other Pakistanis, along with the writers Obama associated with, had a seriousness of purpose and a worldly sensibility.His classmates considered Obama "a floater", moving not only from culture to culture but also from political group to political group, dabbling, showing interest, but never staking a home.
This was a natural part of college experimentation, to be sure, but in Obama's case it reflected a deeper and longer-lasting trend, one that would define his life in and out of politics: his need and ability to avoid traps.
The less entrenched he was, the easier it was for him to get out of something and move on.He had become part of Occidental's activist network, participating in a vigil protesting against the imprisonment of Nelson Mandela.
It led him to give the first public political speech of his life, on 18 February 1981, giving him the first intimations of what it was like to move crowds, large or small, with words.
But after only two years at Occidental, Obama was ready to go.
In late March he filled out applications to transfer toColumbiain New York.
He wanted to go deeper into the American experience, and the black experience.
I figured that if there weren't any more black students at Columbia than there were at Oxy, I'd at least be in the heart of it," he said.The next four years in New York, from late summer 1981 to midsummer 1985, was a lonely time.
As Obama put it himself, decades later, "I was leading an ascetic existence, way too serious for my own good".He felt no attachments to Columbia, but he did enter into a relationship with Alexandra McNear, a former Occidental classmate.
McNear had edited Occidental's literary magazine, Feast, in which Obama had published two poems.
In fact, the nameBarack Obama, as opposed to Barry, premiered in public in the magazine's inaugural issue.
McNear was in New York that summer after her junior year and for nearly two months they were lovers in Manhattan.When it was time for McNear to return to Occidental, they began a long-distance relationship, conducted mostly through a series of passionate letters.
Obama was the central character in his letters, in a self-conscious way, with variations on the theme of his search for purpose and self-identity.
In one letter, he told McNear that it seemed all his Pakistani friends were headed towards the business world, and his old high school buddies from Honolulu were "moving toward the mainstream".
Where did that leave him?
I must admit large dollops of envy for both groups," he wrote.
Caught without a class, a structure, or tradition to support me, in a sense the choice to take a different path is made for me… The only way to assuage my feelings of isolation are to absorb all the traditions [and all the] classes; make them mine, me theirs.
Here, at 22, was an idea that would become a key to understanding Obama the politician and public figure.
Without a class" meant he was entering his adult life without financial security.
Without a "structure" meant he had grown up lacking a solid family foundation, his father gone from the start, his mother often elsewhere, his grandparents doing the best they could, but all leading to his sense of being a rootless outsider.
Without a "tradition" was a reference to his lack of religious grounding and his status as both white and black, feeling completely at home in neither race.
Eventually he could make a few essential choices in terms of how he would live out his personal life, moving inexorably towards the black world.
But in a larger sense, in terms of his ambitions beyond family, he did not want to be constricted by narrow choices.
The different path he saw for himself was to rise above the divisions of culture and society, politics and economics, and embrace something larger.
To make a particular choice would be to limit him, he wrote in the letter to McNear, because "taken separately, they are unacceptable and untenable".Looking back on that period from the distance of the White House, Obama recalled that he was then "deep inside my own head… in a way that in retrospect I don't think was real healthy".
But the realisation that he had to "absorb all the traditions" would become the rationale for all that followed.
There is no doubt that what I retained in my politics is a sense that the only way I could have a sturdy sense of identity of who I was depended on digging beneath the surface differences of people," Obama said during an interview on 10 November 2011.
The only way my life makes sense is if, regardless of culture, race, religion, tribe, there is this commonality, these essential human truths and passions and hopes and moral precepts that are universal.
And that we can reach out beyond our differences.
If that is not the case, then it is pretty hard for me to make sense of my life.
So that is at the core of who I am.
During his Columbia days, Obama discussed his struggle for identity not only with McNear but with a few friends from the Pakistani crowd.
One of his acquaintances in that group was Mir Mahboob Mahmood, known to his friends by his nickname, Beenu.
They were never the closest of friends, yet their conversations seemed to bring out Obama's innermost thoughts and hopes.Mahmood remembered how, "for a period of two or three months", Obama "carried and at every opportunity read and reread a fraying copy ofRalph Ellison's Invisible Man.
It was a period during which Barack was struggling deeply within himself to attain his own racial identity, and Invisible Man became a prism for his self-reflection.
By Mahmood's account, they had known each other only a few months when Obama posed this question to him: "Do you think I will be president of the United States?
What did this mean?
I think it was a very serious question, and clearly, at least in my mind, this was where he was headed," Mahmood recalled.
His answer then: "If America is ready for a black president, you can make it.
When Obama, during the White House interview, was asked about Mahmood's account, he said he could not remember such a conversation, and that people had a natural tendency to apply memories to him retroactively, but added, "If he has a vivid memory of it, I won't deny it."
The ambitious path he saw for himself then, Obama said, remained vague.
I don't think I could see a clear path [to the presidency]," he said.
At that age I was much more interested in being a leader outside of politics.
If you had asked me during that time what kind of career I'd love to have, more likely I would have said something like aBob Moses[the civil rights leader], maybe with a slightly higher profile than that.
Obama with his father, Barack Obama, Sr.
Photograph: Obama For AmericaIn a letter postmarked 22 November 1982, Obama wrote to McNear that he would be coming to Los Angeles for the semester break.
The day after he sent the letter, his father was killed in a car accident in Nairobi.A father he had barely known, gone.
His grandparents thousands of miles away, and his mother farther away still.
It would be hard to overstate the loneliness young Obama felt at that moment, by himself in New York.
But in December, when Obama and McNear reunited in Los Angeles, he casually mentioned it.
It "was not an emotional telling on his side", she said.
They stayed at her apartment for most of two weeks.
McNear wrote in her journal then that Obama "was the closest friend I had, and that I really loved him but didn't know if we could sustain a relationship".She wrote to Obama, expressing the fear that he was becoming less interested in her.
He wrote back on 4 April that she was mistaken.
He was "burning the midnight oil" to finish his studies, he said.
And he was, as usual, consumed by the effort to find himself.
I feel sunk in that long corridor between old values, modes of thought, and those that I seek, that I work towards," he confided.Obama skipped the graduation ceremonies, finishing his time at Columbia much as he had begun: isolated and apart from the college scene.
He had his résumé completed by the time he finished classes.
He took temporary employment where he could find it, spending one week supervising a group of temp workers at the New York fire department.
It was, he reported, "a fascinating experience affording me a taste of the grinding toil of a low-white-collar job, as well as the ambivalent relationship" between bosses and workers.
Here were people talking about sports and life and family in ways that were not fraught with complicated meanings and symbols, he wrote in a letter to his now former girlfriend McNear.
I felt a greater affinity to the blacks and Latinos there (who predictably comprised about three-fourths of the workforce…) than I had felt in a long time, and it strengthened me in some important way.
Obama was six months out of Columbia when Genevieve Cook came along and engaged him in the deepest romantic relationship of his young life.
They met at a Christmas party in 1983.
Cook was Australian, an assistant-teacher in Brooklyn.
Like Obama, she had lived in Indonesia, before her parents divorced, and again briefly in high school.
She called him BAH‑rruck, with a trill of the r's.
She said that is how he pronounced it himself, at least when talking to her.He was living on the Upper West Side then and working in a job that paid the rent but did not inspire him.
He was still keeping mostly to himself, occasionally hanging out with his Pakistani friends, who partied too much and too hard, he thought, but were warm and generous and buoyant intellectual company, always willing to debate philosophy and the political issues of the day.
Cook offered something more.
She was three years older, born in 1958.
She kept a journal, as he did; brooded about her identity, as he did; had an independent, at times exasperating mother, as he did; and burned with an idealism to right the wrongs of the world, as he did.Obama with former lover Genevieve Cook.
He is very beautiful,’ Cook wrote in her diary.
Oooooo, I can’t wait to be in Brooklyn with spring coming.’Day by day, week by week, Cook's perceptions of Obama, noted in her journal, became more complicated.January 26, 1984…how is he so old already, at the age of 22?
I have to recognise (despite play of wry and mocking smile on lips) that I find his thereness very threatening… Distance, distance, distance, and wariness.
I am wary – very clear – I really wonder where it's all going, all this with Barack.February 19Despite Barack's having talked of drawing a circle around the tender in him – protecting the ability to feel innocence and springborn – I think he also fights against showing it to others, to me.
I really like him more and more – he may worry about posturing and void inside but he is a brimming and integrated character.February 24My British humour comes through with him – very uncommon.
An uncommon, earnest young man.
He is very beautiful – more than he thinks himself to be.
Oooooo I can't wait to be in Brooklyn with spring coming…February 25... the sexual warmth is definitely there – but the rest of it has sharp edges and I'm finding it all unsettling and finding myself wanting to withdraw from it all.
I have to admit that I am feeling anger at him for some reason, multi‑stranded reasons.
His warmth can be deceptive.
Tho he speaks sweet words and can be open and trusting, there is also that coolness – and I begin to have an inkling of some things about him that could get to me.May 16It so delights me that from time to time Barack will talk about the more private, inner aspects of what he sees and feels of our relationship – not out of some need to bring up and solve a problem (which is what I tend to do), but merely to communicate it.
It is something I could well learn to do.
To trust him, myself, whatever's cooking there in my brain – the good and the cloudy.June 10Barack frets about the continual comfort I am always willing to offer – recognising it as feeling good, but also chafing against the threat of its impeding a rawer sense of "the struggle"…June 20Curious this thing in Barack, where he identifies "skipping out" on eg Sohale's dinner, with the taking of different paths.
He doesn't just see it as preferring to stay home and start a new story.
Somehow splitting himself off from people is necessary to his feeling of following some chosen route?
which basically remains undefined.
And am I to be left behind also?
That he may feel he's striking out?
Shedding encumbrances, old images, the known and comfortable…June 27But the abruptness and the apparent lack of warmth w/ which B. left them was jarring.Beenu Mahmood saw a shift in Obama that corresponded to Cook's perceptions.
He could see Obama slowly but carefully distancing himself from the Pakistanis as a necessary step in establishing his political identity.
For years, Obama seemed to share their attitudes as sophisticated outsiders who looked at politics from an international perspective.
But to get to where he wanted to go, he had to change – not cut off the Pakistanis as friends, but push away enough to establish a clear and separate identity.
As a result, Mahmood recalled, "The first shift I saw him undertaking was to view himself as an American in a much more fundamental way.
In preparing for his future, Obama disciplined himself in two activities: writing and running.
He was what Cook called "a virtuous daily jogger", and that was one of the differences between them.
She would run, too, but without his discipline and not as far.
One of the reasons he was maybe such a dedicated jogger was part of him still felt he was the fat boy, which I found hard to see," Cook said later.
He had indeed been a chubby boy from infancy through seventh grade, when his body started to elongate.
Cook noticed that despite his thin physique, there was still a certain softness to him: "There was this still quite raw and close to the surface aspect of himself which had to do with being the fat boy, or chubby boy, that people laughed at, that no one knew quite where to put, and who had a deeply ambivalent notion of being loved or not.
They talked about race quite often, as part of his inner need to find a sense of belonging.
She sympathised with and encouraged his search for his identity.
If she felt like an outsider, he was a double outsider, racial and cross-cultural.
He looked black, but was he?
At times he confessed to her that "he felt like an imposter.
Because he was so white.
There was hardly a black bone in his body."
At some point that summer she realised that "in his own quest to resolve his ambivalence about black and white, it became very, very clear to me that he needed to go black".Mahmood saw the same thing as Cook: Obama's internal struggle with his racial identity.
He related it to his memory of Obama carrying around that dog-eared copy of Ellison's Invisible Man, and also to his memory of the day Obama wondered whether he could ever be president.
Trying to embrace his blackness, Mahmood thought, was "probably the biggest shift I saw [in Obama during the New York years]… Barack was the most deliberate person I ever met in terms of constructing his own identity… That was an important period for him, first the shift from not international but American, number one, and then not white, but black.
Early in Obama's relationship with Cook, he had told her about "his adolescent image of the perfect ideal woman" and how he had searched for her "at the expense of hooking up with available girls".
Who was this ideal woman?
In her journals, Cook conjured her in her mind, and it was someone other than herself.
I can't help thinking that what he would really want, be powerfully drawn to, was a woman, very strong, very upright, a fighter, a laugher, well‑experienced – a black woman I keep seeing her as," she wrote.This is an edited extract from Barack Obama: The Making Of The Man, by David Maraniss, published next week by Atlantic Books at £25.

He evendissed Kanye.Butknowing your way around pop culture isn't enough.
It's also about taste.Over the years, Obama has talked about the books, movies, and TV shows he likes the most.Taken together, they create a portrait of a man who’s deeply occupied with American stories, the nature of identity, and just getting away from being the leader of the free world for a while.Let's take a look at Obama's pop culture picks:Obama’s favorite movies are “The Godfather” and “The Godfather II.”Paramount PicturesOne of our most important clues about Obama's favorite works of pop culture isa Facebook postpromoting the Trans-Pacific Partnership and defending the importance of copyright laws.
In it, he said his favorite movies are the first two “Godfather” films.
It’s a smart pick — the two movies are classic American stories and widely-regarded masterpieces of cinema.“There’s this combination of old world gentility and ritual, with this savagery underneath,”Obama told MTV.
It’s all about family.
So it’s a great movie.”He’s also really into classics.Screen grab/CasablancaHisother favoritesinclude “Casablanca,” “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” and “Lawrence of Arabia,” all of which are Oscar winners.AsObama said, “Who doesn’t like Casablanca?”Him and Michelle watched “Do the Right Thing” on their first date.At an event honoring the movie's 25th anniversary, Barack and Michelle Obamarecountedthe time they first watched the Spike Lee movie: their first date.
He was trying to show me his sophisticated side by selecting an independent filmmaker," Michelle said.
It ended up being a pretty good movie.
Do the Right Thing' still holds up a mirror to our society, and it makes us laugh, and think, and challenges all of us to see ourselves in one another,” Barack Obama said.Their first date wasadapted into a movie itself, called "Southside with You.
He’s also dropped the names of a few movies he enjoyed during the course of his presidency.Aidan Monaghan/20th Century FoxIn 2015, he said he really enjoyed“The Martian,"though Michellepreferred Pixar’s "Inside Out."
He likedRichard Linklater’s “Boyhood"best in 2014, and hisfavorite 2012 movieswere "Beasts of the Southern Wild," "Life of Pi," and "Argo.
Star Wars” came out when Obama was a teenager — and he’s a fan.Obama awarded George Lucas the National Medal of Arts — the United States’ highest government award for artists — in 2012.
And at the end of his final press conference last year, on the eve of the release of "Star Wars: The Force Awakens," he told the press room that he was off to see the film.His favorite song is “What’s Going On” by Marvin Gaye.Marvin Gaye.AP / Doug PizacHe’sa big fanofMotown singer Marvin Gaye, though hisfavorite musical artist overall is Stevie Wonder.
When I was at that point where you start getting involved in music, Stevie had that run with 'Music of My Mind,' 'Talking Book,' 'Fulfillingness' First Finale'and 'Innervisions,' and then 'Songs in the Key of Life,'" Obama told Rolling Stone in 2008.
Those are as brilliant a set of five albums as we've ever seen.
In fact, Obama’s taste in music is pretty grounded in the classics.REUTERS/Robert GalbraithHe's been endorsed by Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen, and endorses their music in turn:"I've got probably 30 Dylan songs on my iPod,"he told Rolling Stone.
And while he’s not a Deadhead ("I don't wear tie-dye and I've never followed them around any­where.
 he does listen to The Grateful Dead, as well as Earth, Wind and Fire, Elton John, and The Rolling Stones ("Gimme Shelter" is his favorite song of theirs).In high school, he started listening to more jazz.Jazz trumpeter Miles Davis is pictured during the opening concert of the annual North Sea Jazz Festival in The Hague, July 12, 1987.AP Photo/Ton PouwHe started listening to Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, and John Coltrane, before moving on to Howlin' Wolf, Yo-Yo Ma, Sheryl Crow, and Jay-Z.Like many people, Obama grudgingly admires Kanye West, though he prefers Jay-Z.Dimitrios Kambouris/GettyThere’s a kind of taste test in hip-hop music: Do you prefer Kanye West or Jay-Z?When asked this question by The Atlantic,his answer was Jay-Z—  he and Beyoncé are currently American music’s first family, after all.But he also can’t help but like Kanye.
He called him "a jackass" — presumably a judgment on Kanye’s arrogant public persona — but also "talented.
He likes other contemporary music, too.Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images for NARASHisfavorite song of 2015is“How Much a Dollar Cost” by Kendrick Lamar(Michelle prefers“Uptown Funk”).Last year, he alsorevealeda “summer playlist” on Spotify that demonstrates a more eclectic taste, and includes Sly & The Family Stone, Coldplay, Arcade Fire, and Florence + The Machine.He grew up reading comic books like “Conan the Barbarian” and "Spider-Man.
Universal PicturesIn an email to supporters, Obama wrote “I grew up loving comic books.
Back in the day, I was pretty into Conan the Barbarian and Spiderman.” He forgot the hyphen in Spider-Man, though, which amounts to scandal in the comic book universe.He thinks “The Wire” is the greatest television show of all time.HBO via YouTubeThe critically acclaimed HBO drama often tops lists of the best TV series of this century, but Obama takes it a step further and calls it the best TV show of all time.
He calls Omar, one of the show’s central characters, “the toughest, baddest guy on the show.”But he’s also named “M*A*S*H” his favorite TV show.20th Century FoxIn an offhand comment at a fundraiser in Minneapolis, hecalled the war comedy his favorite show.When he's got a minute, he'll catch up on HBO dramas.HBO/"Boardwalk Empire"With his family, he’ll watch episodes of "Modern Family" and "Parks and Recreation" when it was on the air.

But “Song of Solomon,” about a loose group of black strivers in magical-realist Michigan, is a sensitive pick.Since 2008, Morrison has become close to the president.

Curiously, he considered “the tragedies of William Shakespeare” inspiring as well.
He also, of course, counts The Bible among his favorite books.A lot of his favorite books also grapple with themes of identity.Ralph Ellison, New York author, is a witness, August 30, 1966, at a Senate Subcommittee hearing in Washington during continuing hearings on the racial problems in big cities.AP PhotoAmong themDoris Lessing’s "Golden Notebook," Ellison’s "Invisible Man," and F.

It's also about taste.Over the years, Obama has talked about the books, movies, and TV shows he likes the most.Taken together, they create a portrait of a man who’s deeply occupied with American stories, the nature of identity, and just getting away from being the leader of the free world for a while.Let's take a look at Obama's pop-culture picks:Obama’s favorite movies are “The Godfather” and “The Godfather II.”Paramount PicturesOne of our most important clues about Obama's favorite works of pop culture isa Facebook postpromoting the Trans-Pacific Partnership and defending the importance of copyright laws.
It’s a smart pick — the two movies are classic American stories and widely regarded masterpieces of cinema.“There’s this combination of old world gentility and ritual, with this savagery underneath,”Obama told MTV.
So it’s a great movie.”He’s also really into classics.Screen grab/CasablancaHisother favoritesinclude “Casablanca,” “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” and “Lawrence of Arabia,” all of which are Oscar winners.AsObama said, “Who doesn’t like Casablanca?”Him and Michelle watched “Do the Right Thing” on their first date.At an event honoring the movie's 25th anniversary, Barack and Michelle Obamarecountedthe time they first watched the Spike Lee movie: their first date.
He’s also dropped the names of a few movies he enjoyed during the course of his presidency.Aidan Monaghan/20th Century FoxIn 2015, he said he really enjoyed“The Martian," though Michellepreferred Pixar’s "Inside Out."
Star Wars” came out when Obama was a teenager — and he’s a fan.Obama awarded George Lucas the National Medal of Arts — the US's highest government award for artists — in 2012.
 he does listen to The Grateful Dead, as well as Earth, Wind and Fire, Elton John, and The Rolling Stones ("Gimme Shelter" is his favorite song of theirs).In high school, he started listening to more jazz.Jazz trumpeter Miles Davis is pictured during the opening concert of the annual North Sea Jazz Festival in The Hague, July 12, 1987.AP Photo/Ton PouwHe started listening to Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, and John Coltrane, before moving on to Howlin' Wolf, Yo-Yo Ma, Sheryl Crow, and Jay-Z.Like many people, Obama grudgingly admires Kanye West, though he prefers Jay Z.Dimitrios Kambouris/GettyThere’s a kind of taste test in hip-hop music: Do you prefer Kanye West or Jay Z?When asked this question by The Atlantic,his answer was Jay Z— he and Beyoncé are currently American music’s first family, after all.But he also can’t help but like Kanye.
He likes other contemporary music, too.Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images for NARASHisfavorite song of 2015is“How Much a Dollar Cost” by Kendrick Lamar.
Michelle prefers“Uptown Funk.”)Last year, he alsorevealeda “summer playlist” on Spotify that demonstrates a more eclectic taste, and includes Sly & The Family Stone, Coldplay, Arcade Fire, and Florence + The Machine.He grew up reading comic books like “Conan the Barbarian” and "Spider-Man.
Back in the day, I was pretty into Conan the Barbarian and Spiderman.” He forgot the hyphen in Spider-Man, though, which amounts to scandal in the comic-book universe.He thinks “The Wire” is the greatest television show of all time.HBO via YouTubeThe critically acclaimed HBO drama often tops lists of the best TV series of this century, but Obama takes it a step further and calls it the best TV show of all time.
He alsoliked "Mad Men"(it “explains my grandparents, their tastes”) as well as "Entourage" and "Downton Abbey.
One of the perks of being president is that he gets to see who dies on “Game of Thrones” before everyone else.HBOThe show runners said thatthe White House requested screener copiesof the new season before the premiere.
She wrote aflattering letter endorsing him, and heenlisted heras a member of his brain trust to map out his post-presidency, and awarded her a Medal of Freedom in 2012.He also admires author Marilynne Robinson, and considers her book “Gilead” one of his favorites.President Barack Obama, accompanied by Pulitzer Prize winning Iowa writer Marilynne Robinson, arrives to the State Library of Iowa in the Ola Babcock Miller Building, Monday, Sept. 14, 2015, in Des Moines.
He’s long considered her book “Gilead” one of his favorites andawarded herthe National Medal of Arts in 2013.His taste in books shows that he’s a student of American literature and history.Wikimedia CommonsOnhis Facebook page, Obama says his favorite books include "Moby-Dick," Ralph Waldo Emerson’s "Self-Reliance," Lincoln’s collected writings, and “Parting the Waters: America in the King Years 1954-63,” a volume by Taylor Branch about the civil-rights movement.Elsewhere, he identified himself as a fan of Doris Kearns Goodwin’s “Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,” which is widely cited as the book that made him pick his onetime political rival Hillary Clinton as secretary of state.In an interview with Rolling Stone, ObamaidentifiedErnest Hemingway’s “For Whom the Bell Tolls” as a book that inspires him.
He also, of course, counts the Bible among his favorite books.A lot of his favorite books also grapple with themes of identity.Ralph Ellison, New York author, is a witness, August 30, 1966, at a Senate Subcommittee hearing in Washington during continuing hearings on the racial problems in big cities.AP PhotoAmong themDoris Lessing’s "Golden Notebook," Ellison’s "Invisible Man," and F.

He also included Stacy Schiff's Founding Father biography,The Revolutionary: Samuel Adams, as well as novels by Charmaine Wilkerson (Black Cake) and Hernan Diaz (Trust).
Imani Perry's historical text,South to America: A Journey Below the Mason-Dixon to Understand the Soul of a Nation, also made the listObama's movie choices run the gamut fromViola Davis' war epicThe Woman KingtoTom Cruise's epic sequelTop Gun: MavericktoMichelle Yeohjust being epic inEverything Everywhere All At Once.
He also really enjoyedCate Blanchette's tour de force inTar,Steve Spielberg's coming-of-age dramaThe Fabelmans, the story of Emmett Till told through his mother's eyes,Till, and the documentaryDescendant, which he and Michelle produced through their Higher Ground company.And finally, what's got Barack Obama busting out his world-famous dad dance moves?Beyoncé's "Break My Soul,"Lizzo's "About Damn Time,"Bad Bunny's "Tití Me Preguntó,"Maggie Rogers' "That's Where I Am," andRosalía's "Saoko" all made the list of his fave tunes of the year.But what about TV?

In addition to sharing his Favorite Books of 2022, Obama is ready to release a list of his Favorite Movies of 2022, includingTop Gun: Maverick, The Woman King,Everything Everywhere All At Once,Emily the Criminal, and more.
Obama posted the complete list toInstagramon Friday, cementing his reputation as a man of taste.Earlier this year, Obama shared a Spotify playlist link presenting hisfavorite Summer Jams of 2022.
Included on the list were Beyoncé, Prince, Al Green, Miles Davis, Fatboy Slim, Joe Cocker, Burna Boy, Kendrick Lamar, Tems, and one of my favorites, the British indie rock band Wet Leg.
The mix will bring heat to any pool party full of people looking to get their drink on while playing Beach Blanket Bingo.View this post on InstagramA post shared by Barack Obama (@barackobama)The complete list of Obaman’s Favorite Films of 2022 includes Steven Spielberg’sThe Fabelmans, Park Chan-wook’sDecision to Leave, Gina Prince-Bythewood’sThe Woman King, Charlotte Wells’Aftersun, John Patton Ford’sEmily the Criminal, Celine Sciamma’sPetite Maman, Margaret Brown’sDescendant, Audrey Diwane’sHappening, Chinonye Chukwu’sTill, Daniels’Everything Everywhere All at Once, Fernando León de Aranoa’sThe Good Boss, Ryusuke Hamaguchi’sWheel of Fortuneand Fantasy, Asghar Farhadi’sA Hero, Panah Panahi’sHit the Road, Todd Field’sTarand Kogonada’sAfter Yang.Followers of Obama’s social media accounts were quick to point out that Ryan Coogler’sBlack Panther: Wakanda Foreveris missing from the list.
Oddly, Marvel’s emotional sequel did not make Obama’s list, but he’s a busy guy.
It’s entirely possible that he has yet to have the chance to see Coogler’s new film.
I’ve missed tons of movies this year, and I have much more time on my hands than the former President.What movies do you think should be added to Obama’s list that he should make the time to watch?
Which among the titles listed do you think is his favorite film of the year overall?

The annual list is always an eclectic collection of cinema that reveals a wide-ranging taste that rivals that of professional film critics.“I always look forward to sharing my lists of favorite books, movies, and music with all of you,” Obama tweeted, before beginning his rollout of his picks from the culture he consumed.For his films, he tweeted December 23, “I saw some great movies this year — here are some of my favorites.” His list put Steven Spielberg’s “The Fabelmans” at the top, followed by Park Chan-wook’s murder-mystery “Decision to Leave” and Gina Prince-Bythewood’s “The Woman King.”Obama’s list also included “Aftersun,” “Emily the Criminal,” “Petite Maman,” “Happening,” “Till,” “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” “Top Gun: Maverick,” “The Good Boss,” “Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy,” “A Hero,” “Hit the Road,” “TÁR,” and “After Yang.” He also included “Descendant” with the caveat that, since it was produced by his production company Higher Ground, he’s biased in its favor.RelatedEvery Studio Film Directed by Filmmakers of Color Coming Out in 2023 and 2024Every Studio Film Directed by Female Filmmakers Coming Out in 2023 and 2024Related2023 Emmys Predictions: Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or a Movie'Song of the South': 13 Things to Know About Disney's Most Controversial MovieSeven of his picks echo IndieWire’sown top 10 of the year, including “The Fabelmans,” “After Yang,” “Decision to Leave,” and “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” though IndieWire declared “Aftersun” the best of the year.Many of Obama’s 2021 picks went on to earn Oscar nominations (and the gold).

All Rights ReservedThis Is What Barack Obama EatsRECIPESNEWSEXCLUSIVESRESTAURANTSGROCERYHOW TOFACTSTIPSTVFEATURESThis Is What Barack Obama EatsGetty ImagesByChris Heasman/Updated: Jan. 31, 2023  8:40 pm ESTIt's probably not an exaggeration to suggest that Barack Obama might have been the most physically fit President the United States of America has ever had.
That comes down to a few things, as it does with anybody — a decentworkout routinedoesn't hurt, for example, and we can't rule out good genes.
But a crucial part of his health is his diet; a topic which was approached with some curiosity by the media during his presidency.Now, we've looked at thecurrent President'sfood habits before, and let's just say that, well, they aren't great.
And while we'd never want to foster such divisions as to compare the two, it'll certainly be interesting to see how Obama stacks up.
All we'll say is this: expect more salads, more fruit and far, far fewer calories.
From the early breakfasts to the chili recipes to the Dijon mustard scandal that rocked the world, these are the eating habits of Barack Obama.Coffee is out of the questionShutterstockToday, upwards of83 percentof adults in the United States drink coffee, most of them during the morning.
Obama is not one of them.
Yes, despite a grueling daily routine (which, to be fair, is probably a little bit less grueling these days), according to personal aideReggie Love, Obama rarely drinks coffee in the morning.
Instead, he opts for healthier fare, which might include orange juice, green tea or simply water.
This iscombined witha daily, 45-minute strength or cardio workout.
Put them together and cut out the caffeine dependency and you've got yourself an ex-President who, at the age of 56, is healthier than most people are when they're 30.The few times he has drunk coffee, however, Obama has courted disaster.
In 2014, the world watched in horror as the then-President saluted two marine guardswhile holding a coffee cup— just the sort of devastating faux pas that will probably make Obama regret his decision to break his no-coffee rule until the end of time.Breakfast is a big deal, thoughShutterstockBreakfastis as big a deal to Obama as it is to the majority of wholesome Americans.
His most common choice of breakfast food tends to be eggs —four to six— potatoes and wheat toast.
Considering agood breakfast canreduce your chances of becoming obese, boosts your metabolism, lowers your cholesterol levels and has a positive effect on the brain, Obama's rigorous keeping to a healthy breakfast as part of his morning routine is probably a good idea.When he was President, Obama would usually include breakfast with that workout and be in the Oval Office, ready to work, by the mid-morning.
Now, however, things are a bit easier, and Obama hasopened up abouthow he's enjoyed the freedom of being able to control his mornings himself.
With this in mind, it's probably not a stretch to imagine that, nowadays, he probably indulges in a lie-in and a late breakfast every now and then.
Wouldn't you?Everything's healthy — mostlyGetty ImagesThe rule of thumb with Obama's diet is that, with a few notable exceptions (which we'll talk about later), he generally eats healthily.
Australia's ex-Foreign Minister, Bob Carr,suggested thatObama avoids sugar, carbs and fat, a regime which has allowed him entry into the auspicious elite of the flat-stomached.
Indeed, Obama is rarely spotted drinking fizzy soft drinks, chowing down on crazy unhealthy fast food or imbibing sugar like it's the end of days.Early in his first term at the White House, the Obamas made a splash by planting the firstvegetable gardenon the property since Eleanor Roosevelt's during the Second World War.
The garden, which was cared for and run byMichelle Obama, provided food for family meals and organic dinners alike, and served to raise awareness about healthy eating.
It included over 55 varieties of vegetables, mostly suggested by kitchen staff, and counted tomatillos, peppers, lettuces, spinach, kale, berries and more in its line-up.Chili is his number one recipeShutterstockObama has a whole list of favorite foods that have been made public, but one of the recipes that stands at the very top is chili.
Barack Obama's very own homemade chili recipe, which isavailable onlinethanks to Michelle, stems from their time in Chicago, where they'd invite friends and family over to enjoy it.
Wouldn't you love to be one of those lucky Chicago natives who can say they've been served dinner by the former President?
It's a turkey or beef-based recipe and utilizes red wine vinegar, turmeric and basil among the staple ingredients, like kidney beans, onions, peppers and so on.
Serve over rice or with a healthy topping of crushed crackers, and you're good to go.If you're planning on hosting a partisan political Tex-Mex theme night (and why wouldn't you?)
we'd suggest combining Obama's chili recipe with theTrump Grill taco bowlto really see who's got it best.He won't say no to a burgerWhile health may be at the forefront of Obama's eating habits, that's not to say that he doesn't indulge in a treat every now and again.
Just like his successor (well, okay, notjustlike his successor), Obama has a fondness for burgers and isn't averse to stopping at a take-out every now and again.
Unlike Trump, however, he always tended to prefer smaller, local burger joints rather than the larger chain restaurants — in 2009, for example, he and V.P.
Joe Biden took their motorcade to Ray's Hell Burger, an Arlington-based eatery known for its unusual burger toppings.Only a year later, Obama returned to Ray's Hell Burger with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.
They sat amongst a crowd of onlookers as Obama opted for a standard cheeseburger, while Medvedev had one with jalapenos, mushrooms and onions.
They shared an order of fries.Dijon disasterOh boy.
We hope you're ready for this one, because we're about to delve into the most shocking scandal to have ever rocked the Obama Administration.
If you're just here to read fun things about food, skip to the next item (it's about chocolate!
 because things are going to get pretty heavy in here.The year was 2011.
The scene was the previously mentioned Ray's Hell Burger.
The witnesses were Joe Biden, a press pack, a crowd of burgers fans and Sean Hannity's ego.
The crime, of course, was Obama ordering Dijon mustard on his burger.
Yes, Obama eschewed the traditional condimental topping of ketchupin favor of its spicier, yellower and Frencher cousin.
America's right-wing press immediately went on the attack, with Fox News' Hannity — presumably bored of waiting more a more delicious scandal to come along (only five more years, Sean!)
 running a segment which dubbed him "President Poupon.
He adores one chocolatier more than any otherShutterstockPhew.
That was a lot, right?
After such an intense dive into the depths of political and ethical depravity, you might want to kick back and enjoy something lighter.
Well, here's something — Obama's favorite chocolatier.Fran's Chocolatesis a Seattle-based chocolatier set up by Fran Bigelow, which Obama revealed in May 2008 as a personal love of his.It began with Seattle businesswoman Cynthia Stroum, who introduced the Obamas to Fran's at a campaign stop by way of a welcome basket, and subsequently got them hooked.
The love of the chocolates spread to the Secret Service, who began asking after them, and then, somehow, to the cast of ABC'sThe Viewafter Michelle sent them a sample.
Michelle's preference is for dark chocolate, while Barack himself allegedly goes for smoked salt caramels in milk chocolate.
And when you've got a President, a First Lady, the Secret Service, and a daytime talk show clamoring for more, it's fair to say you can make good chocolate.He brews his own beerThe Obamas aren't exactly binge-drinkers, but when they do indulge in a beer or two, at least they do it right.
In 2014, Obama was grantedlifetime membershipto the American Homebrewers Association in recognition of his position as the first President to home brew at the White House.
In 2011, he had teamed up with his chef Sam Kass to begin crafting their own beer and, with the help of local home brewers, concocted two recipes: one for White House Honey Ale and the other for White House Honey Porter.The honey porter includes black malt, chocolate malt, and honey, while the ale utilizes biscuit malt, gypsum and honey in its recipe.
The honey that's used isparticularly special, drawn from the apiary on the White House's South Lawn and offering a paler and lighter honey than most.
Considering the current President claims tonever touch alcohol, it's unlikely that the hives are producing honey for home brews anymore — if they're still there at all.His favorite foodsShutterstockAt the end of the day, it's easiest to get a feeling for someone's eating habits simply by taking a gander at their favorite and least favorite foods.According to Reggie Love, Obama's picks include chocolates from Fran's Chocolates (but you knew that), trail mix (nuts, berries, seeds, raisins and so on), roasted almonds, pistachio nuts, water, Dentyne Ice chewing gum, MET-Rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and vegetables — with broccoli and spinach being particular favs.You can see an image forming already, can't you?
Healthy with a tendency towards a guilty pleasure or two" is the bottom line, here, and the Obama diet seems to consist mostly of vegetables, health foods and simplicities (water, Barack?
Really?
 with little room for anything ostentatious, beyond a chocolate or two.
Love explains that Obama also uses Nicorette gum, though that may be because of another guilty pleasure of his rather than any particular appreciation for it.His least favorite foodsShutterstockThe other end of the spectrum, asLove tells it, is a little more peculiar.
Obama's food-related bugbears would appear to include mayonnaise (though, if Dijongate is anything to go by, he's not a massive fan of ketchup, either), salt and vinegar potato chips, asparagus — though he'll eat it if he has to, apparently — and soft drinks.
The man prefers water, you see.In the past, Obama has also voiced aparticular distastefor British cuisine, making clear his dislike of traditional British food on the campaign trail in 2007 with a (probably half-joking, in fairness) sneer and a cringe, before suggesting to a voter that her notion of England having better food than America was down to "all those good Indian restaurants they have there now."
So there you have it: Gum, nuts and water are in, asparagus, mayo and fish and chips are out.
President Barack Obama, everybody.Recommended

During his first term in office, the president converted the White House tennis court into a basketball court, ensuring he would be able to play as often as possible.Fiercely competitive, the outgoing POTUS has been seen shooting around with college basketball teams during their visits to the White House.
He has even invited members of staff and NBA players to pickup games and reportedly said he would refuse to invite any athlete back if they didn't go hard on him.<a href="https://twitter.com/YesTheCap">@YesTheCap</a> ferguson playing basketball with Obama (2011) <a href="https://t.co/VzZMY8EFr7">pic.twitter.com/VzZMY8EFr7</a>&mdash;@NoMoreAnimeNot just a b-ballerWhile basketball might be the out-going president's first love, he has proven he can hang in other sporting spheres as well.
Like presidents before him, he has been bowling in the White House bowling alley, he's been golfing with Golden State Warriors Steph Curry, and even played ping pong with former British Prime Minister David Cameron during a visit to the U.K.The time David Cameron and Barack Obama played ping pong.

Taking the mound at the game in St. Louis, the president boldly sported a Chicago White Sox jacket in support of his hometown team.
Luckily, his potentially controversial choice in allegiance was overshadowed by his now infamous fashion failing "dad jeans.
POTUS picksThroughout his presidency, Obama filling out the NCAA basketball bracket for ESPN became an annual tradition.
While his track record has not been great, having predicted only one winner in 2009, he has come close, picking teams that made it to the fourth round in 2011, 2012 and 2014.
Last year he chose Kansas, which made it to the final four before being illuminated by eventual winner Villanova.President Obama typically goes chalk in filling out his bracket.<br><br>The final Barack-etology: <a href="https://t.co/ycs1UF2uUj">https://t.co/ycs1UF2uUj</a> <a href="https://t.co/M3StKWCnKF">pic.twitter.com/M3StKWCnKF</a>&mdash;@espnChampions in the 'House'White house visits by championship teams is an American tradition.
Olympic medallists, NCAA winners and professional sports champions have all made their way to the executive mansion to receive congratulations from the president.Most recently on Monday the World Series champion Chicago Cubs paid him a visit, presenting Obama with a Cubs jersey fittingly endowed with the No.
44, for the 44th president.Outfielder Dexter Fowler took the meeting a step further, bringing the POTUS a custom pair of Jordan brand sneakers which he showed off on his Instagram account.Medal of FreedomThroughout his eight years in the presidency, Obama has awarded the Medal of Freedom to 12 athletes — more than any other U.S. president in history.
Regarded as the greatest civilian honour, some of the recipients during the Obama tenure have included baseball Hall of Famer Stan Musial, the late legendary women's college basketball coach Pat Summitt, and most recently NBA great Michael Jordan.Moved by the honour, the six-time NBA champion seemed to get emotional during the ceremony, almost bringing the "crying Michael Jordan" meme to life.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBCSportsCorrections and clarifications|Report errorCommentsTo encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

In 2008, Obama had said before a debate, “Just give me the ball!” Now, he said, “Let’s just get this over with and get out of here.”Romney wound upclobbering Obamathat night.
When Obama faced his aides a few days later, he sounded like a losing quarterback: “It’s all on me.” Obama explained that his debating skills were as out of whack as Roy McAvoy’s golf game inTin Cup.As Obama threw himself into preparation for the next debate, Klain offered another sports metaphor.This debate is like theend of the Rams-Titans Super Bowl, Klain said.The difference between election and defeat — between Obamacare and repeal — could be a single yard.This was a typical sequence from the sports-mad presidency of Barack Obama.
Every president campaigns with athletes, arranges them as props at his State of the Union, and uses sports as alingua francato speak to Joe Sixpack.
Yet what Obama did was astounding.
He filled nearly every minute of his administration with sports talk — using it as entertainment, metaphor, and, finally, as a political weapon.
It was easy to miss that last aspect when Obama wastweeting about Jimmy Butler’s extension.The White House has known extremesports nerdery before.
Asked by a reporter in 1972 to come up with his all-time Major League Baseball team, Richard Nixon suppliedfourteams: American and National League teams for both pre- and post-1945.
Yet Obama ascended to a plane beyond what Nixon or any other president could dream of.
He didn’t just go on ESPN to fill in an NCAA bracket (“Barack-etology”) every year.
He filled in awomen’sbracket, too.Jason Chaffetz, the Republican congressman from Utah, once told me he thought Obama’s sports fandom was real and deep.
Conservatives had tweaked Obama for saying he watched his beloved White Sox at “Cominskey Field.”) But even Chaffetz couldn’t believe Obama was talking fluently about women’s basketball without glancing at talking points.
No way that was legit!”Like no president before, save maybe Gerald Ford, Obama could be understood through the prism of his favorite sport, basketball.
Michael Lewis followed Obama to a game for a2012Vanity Fairprofileand found metaphors for the Obama presidency strewn all over the court.
Four years after his ascension, Obama was no longer a transformational star — a max player — but a veteran facilitator like late-career Kevin Garnett.
He’s switched to trying to figure out how to make his team win,” Lewis wrote.
And there was this, from one of Obama’s fellow players: “Unlike a lot of lefties, he can go to his right.”In public, Obama was often remote.
In hoops, you could see a ruthless streak.
Obama liked playing at the basketball court at FBI headquarters, because the court was slightly smaller and, thus, it was easier for an old guy to assert himself.
The plan had been for Lewis and Obama to play on the same team, but Obama asked Lewis to sit until the team got a lead.
I was benched,” Lewis wrote.Writing inThe Undefeated, LZ Grandersonarguedthat Obama’s love of basketball may have worked as a tractor beam to pull players like LeBron James toward liberal causes.
NBA commissioner Adam Silvernotedanother effect: Because America had an African American president, a single basketball player committing a crime didn’t get the whole league dismissed as “thugs.”All of this was orchestrated by someone who didn’t have even a significant high-school basketball career.
During a 2008 campaign stop in Kuwait, Obama addressed troops on a court.
Then hewalked a basketballup to just outside the 3-point line.
I may not make the first one,” he said.
But I’ll make one eventually.” He let go of the ball, it went through the net, and Obama stuck both hands up in the air.It’s one thing to mix sports talk with presidential stagecraft.
Obama wanted more than that.
He wanted to be our sports-talk-host-in-chief, weighing in on the burning issues of the day.In 2013, ObamatoldThe New Republicthat if he had a son, “I’d have to think long and hard before I let him play football.” HetoldBill Simmons he couldn’t believe Roger Goodell made $44 million in one year.
Obama wasagainst the BCS,against stadium financing scams,against Donald Sterling(he called him “ignorant”), and thoughtcollege basketball’s shot clockshould be 30, rather than 35, seconds.None of these were exactly hot takes.
Indeed, when he talked sports, Obama sounded like your typical, liberal-inclined sportswriter, furrowing his brow and (to use a slogan that got slapped on his foreign policy) “leading from behind.”Sports was the chief metaphor of the Obama White House.
During the 2014 midterms, when Democrats asked Obama to stay off the trail, an anonymous aidetoldTheNew York Times: “You’re in the Final Four, and you’re on the bench with a walking boot and you don’t get to play.”Obama, in turn,used the language of sports to describe himself.
He was Aaron Rodgers, he told Simmons, his eyes always trained downfield despite a messy pocket.
Teasing out his foreign policy at a stop in the Philippines, Obamasaid: “You hit singles, you hit doubles; every once in a while we may be able to hit a home run.”In 2014, Obamascoffedat the remnants of Al Qaeda that had outlived Osama bin Laden: “[I]f a JV team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant.” The metaphor wouldbecome notoriouswhen another terrorist group, ISIS, claimed tracts in Syria and Iraq.RelatedObama’s Biggest MistakeYet for every time he tried way too hard, Obama unlocked moments of pure joy only accessible to a genuine fan.
He was the first president to establish full diplomatic relations with the nation’s athletes, and the shit talk echoed back and forth between the locker room and the White House.Obamatoldsoccer player Tim Howard to shave his beard.
When the Miami Heat visited the White House, he knewthe right, slashing joketo make about Mario Chalmers.
LeBron James put his head on Dwyane Wade’s shoulder as he dissolved in laughter.)
Steph CurrysaidonEllenthat Obama talked trash while playing golf: “I’ll hit a shot out of bounds, and he’ll just look like, ‘Yeah, that’s not a good shot.
I’m going to need you to do better next time.’”Two years ago, Michael Jordan dismissed Obama as a “shitty” golfer.
Obamafired back: “There is no doubt that Michael is a better golfer than I am.
Of course, if I was playing twice a day for the last 15 years, then that might not be the case.”Obama added, “He might want to spend more time thinking about the Bobcats.”Here you can almost hear Obama’s internal editor stepping in —the sports-talk-host-in-chief has to be exact!“Or the Hornets,” he added.Charming anecdotes like these didn’t walk from the White House to the front page of the newspaper.
The endless reminders of Obama’s sports fandom made you realize that America wasn’t just eavesdropping on a man’s private passion.
If Obama was more sports-mad than any president, he alsousedsports more ruthlessly.
He made it into cold-blooded political tool.When I point this out to Obamaites, they often respond, “Oh, I think he really loves sports.” Well, sure.
And Bill Clinton really loved the saxophone.
But whenClinton played the sax onArsenio, it morphed from a hobby into a campaign prop.
This is exactly what happened with Obama and sports.Early in Obama’s presidency, stories leaked to reporters that painted a picture of a gonzo fan who somehow coped with being leader of the free world.
In a 2008 meeting, Obama was “sending urgent-looking BlackBerry messages back and forth” with Robert Gibbs, his first press secretary.
What was so important?
Obama,TheNew York Timesreported, was chatting with Gibbs about his fantasy team.InDouble Down, Halperin and Heilemann noted that Obama’s Treaty Room had a computer, printer, and “a TV for monitoring ESPN.” (Not CNN?
My favorite Obama set piece was staged on May 20, 2012, when Obama left a dinner with NATO allies to go to Chicago’s Soldier Field.
There, he picked up a football and cocked it in his left arm, while the perfectly positioned White House photographer, Pete Souza, snapped away.
On the White House website, the picture was selected as a “photo of the day.” Why?
Obama was running for re-election.
Throwing a football made him look really cool.It was a perfectly manipulative use of sports fandom.
It’s not unlike the times Michael Dukakis, during his 1988 campaign, grabbed a baseball glove and played catch on a tarmac in front of reporters.
As Joan DidionwroteinTheNew York Review of Books:There was more than a little willingness to accept spin — there was with Obama, too.Of course, Obama had good reasons to lay it on thick.
He spent his presidency being labeled The Other — a madrassa-educated, Kenyan-born, America-(god)damning socialist mole who would shred the Constitution.I oncewrotethat when Obama talks sports, he shows America his birth certificate.
I never figured that the man demanding the birth certificate would replace him.And it should be said that Obama’s sports campaign was wildly successful.He forged a bond with Rust Belt voters that Hillary Clinton couldn’t in 2016; for such a remote figure, Obama came off as more approachable than either of his opponents.
Other than convincing Americans he could be a transformative, cross-partisan force, convincing them he loved sports as madly and deeply as they did was Obama’s greatest act of salesmanship.
He showed more gusto talking sports than he ever did defending Obamacare.Outside of midwifing a new wave of athlete political awareness, Obama’s sports talk leaves no real intellectual legacy.
But it shows how genuine passion and political theater can converge until they become the same thing.
Back in 2012, when Obama recommitted himself to debate prep after his disastrous first encounter with Romney, David Axelrod was struck.
Here was a lifelong underdog ready to pull off another upset.
Obama was shooting like Paul Westphal; he was holding the goal line like the Rams.
As Axelrod laternoted, it was just like the ending ofHoosiers.Most ReadKevin Love Wants to Keep GoingA Hall of Fame career might be enough for some, but not for Love.

At 47, Obama regularly plays basketball and is an unabashed fan of the game.
How do his skills match up with the other 43 leaders of our country?
Here’s a look at our country’s most athletic presidents.10.
George W. BushThe one-time part owner of the Texas Rangers, Bush has showed off his throwing arm on numerous occasions in throwing out the first pitch at Major League ballgames.
Like his father, Bush played baseball at Yale and has also enjoyed running and cycling in his leisure time.9.
Abraham LincolnLincolnwas known as a pretty fair wrestler in his youth.
Most noteworthy was a wrestling match against Jack Armstrong in 1831 in New Salem.
Armstrong was considered the best fighter in the area, but several accounts of the match haveLincolnwinning handily.Lincolnwas also known for his strength reportedly carried a load of 600 pounds.8.
John F. KennedyKennedy was a swimmer at Harvard and won an intercollegiate sailing championship with his brother Joe.
He also played football and the family touch football games on the White House lawn were legendary during his term as president.7.
Jimmy CarterCarter was president in the late 1970s – right when the running craze hitAmerica.
A cross country runner in the service, Carter was often shown running for recreation during his White House days.
In high school in Plains,Ga., Carter was a standout in basketball and reportedly played baseball while serving in the Navy.6.
Ronald ReaganReagan may have been better known for portraying athletes in the movies than actually being an athlete.
He played George Gipp in the movie “Knute Rockne, All-American” and Grover Alexander in “The Winning Team.” Reagan graduated fromDixonHigh SchoolinIllinoiswhere he played sports.
According to Reagan, he was lifeguard and saved 77 lives in 1926.
He also reportedly played football atEurekaCollege.
Riding horseback and working on hisCaliforniaranch were some of the more physical activities he participated in during his two terms as president.5.
Barack ObamaThe newly-elected president has made no secret of his love for the game of basketball.
Often shown playing pickup games during his campaign, Obama is reported to have ledOccidentalCollegein scoring in 1979; however other reports list him as a member of the JV team, not the varsity.
Obama graduated fromPunahouHigh SchoolinHawaii, which has won 322 state championships, the most of any school in the nation.4.

The 34th president also enjoyed golfing during his two terms in office.1.
Gerald FordFord was the center on two national championship teams atMichigan(1932, 1933).

However, it is important to remember that Obama was a key supporter of reforming climate policies and reducing carbon pollution through increasing car's fuel efficiency, making it understandable that he drives mostly modern, efficient carsrather than vintage gas-guzzling muscle cars.Let's go on to look at the cars that feature in ex-President Barack Obama's driving history.2008 Ford Escape HybridVia: CarWallsObama's 2008 Ford Escape Hybrid is by no means the typical car of any famous person, be it celebrity or politician.While a hybrid SUV seems like an irrationally mundane choice for a car, Obama's political persona as an avid activist for the reduction of carbon emissions actually supports such a choice, as an insanely inefficient car would be directly hypocritically to his political ideology.Now while Obama helped finance various green movements and organizations, luckily for us, his Escape did not adopt the green exterior depicted above.
Instead, his dark gray Escape houses a more bulky front end, spacious seating capacity, and an impressive fuel economy, 34 MPG City and 30 MPG Highway.
Furthermore, the car has a variety of comfort features such as cruise control, keyless entry, and adjustable steering wheel.
The downside of impressive efficiency is poor performance, which is due to the increased weight of the hybrid power terrain and the minimal power potential, 133 HP, of the hybrid 4-cylinder engine.
That being said the '08Escape creates class-leading efficiency and it still remains that way today.Ex-President Obama proves his politics, promoting efficiency in his ownership of the 2008 Ford Escape Hybrid.RELATED:2020 Ford Escape Hybrid Plug-in Reaches 100 MPGe Milestone2005 Chrysler 300CVia: Auto EvolutionObama also briefly owned a 2005 Chrysler 300C.
That's right, the one with the proper HEMI V8.Before you yell "HYPOCRITE" and vent your anger on Facebook, it is important to mention that Obama owned this car while he was a senator, and before his major involvement in environmental politics.
But we are not here to discuss politics, so let's look at the '05 300c.
In contrast to the Escape, the 300c hosts a huge 5.7-liter HEMI V8 that produces 340 HP, putting it in an entirely different category.
The power is sent to the rear wheels through a 5-speed automatic transmission, producing a 0-60 MPH time of 5.3 seconds.The 300's muscular front end and bulky exterior harks back to the muscle cars of the '60s and '70s but utilizes modern technology to create a variety of luxury comfort options that are rare in classic muscle cars.
From digital climate control to a Multi-Displacement System that promotes fuel economy by shutting off four cylinders, the 300c juxtaposes Mopar with modern, giving an aggressive driving experience that does not skimp on comfort.While Obama's ownership of the 300c only lasted during the time that he was a governor, car enthusiasts can all agree that it makes a pretty awesome addition to the list,even if it is not worth the $1 Million eBay asking price that someone attempted to sell it for.2000 Jeep Grand CherokeeVia: YouTubeKeeping in line with the Ex-President's affinity for SUVs, the 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee is certainly a more capable off-road vehicle than his hybrid Escape.While it might not be the most reliable year for the Grand Cherokee, it is not only a great first new car but definitely impressive in its own right.
Besides the soft leather upholstery and dual-zone climate control, the performance of the Grand Cherokee is a key selling point.
Performance is promoted through its nimble size and powerful engine choices: a 4.0-liter inline-six producing 195 HP and a 4.7-liter V8 producing 235 HP, making it equally apt for suburban sight-seeing and munching through mud.
Grip is maximized through its dedicated 4WD system (MotorTrend), which senses and controls torque transfer.The 2000 Grand Cherokee supports ex-president Obama's modesty, demonstrating a wide variety of impressive cars that can be attained by everyday people.Current CarVia: Liberty CityAs with any Ex-President of the US, Obama is not allowed to drive himself anywhere in his own private car, a fundamental privilege most citizens enjoy.This is understandably so, as Obama is still a significant figure in American society, especially politics, even if he is no longer the president.
Hence, the Secret Service chauffeurs him everywhere he goes, fully accompanying him on his journey, to ensure that his safety and security are upheld even in his Ex-President status.
While there are minimal specifics available online, Grunge states that the "[ex-presidents] can never drive a car on an open road again," and are instead driven around by specially trained members of the Secret Service.Again, specifics of Secret Service vehicles are not divulged online, however, an article by The Drive confirms that heavily modified Chevrolet Suburbans are part of the Secret Service vehicle 'collection'.Far from factory standard, these sturdy SUVs feature additional armor plating and defensive systems to protect their passengers.While there is no explicit confirmation that the Secret Service actively chauffers Obama around in a Chevy Suburban, chances are the Ex-President has ridden in one at least once in his post-presidency life.Sources: HotCars.com, Cars.USNews.com, MotorTrend.com, CarAndDriver.com, AutoExpress.co.uk, GearPatrol.com, FoxNews.com, Grunge.com.

By then, President Obama was running for a seat in the U.S. senate — so Murphy photocopied the title, hoping the vehicle might be worth something someday.
Indeed, it was: Even though she daily drove it as if it were any other Grand Cherokee, she auctioned it off in 2010, after President Obama’s ascent to the highest elected office in the U.S., and received just under $26,500 for it — or roughly eight times its normal value.
The buyer, John Reznikoff, was an expert on historical documents and memorabilia.So how does President Obama remember his Grand Cherokee?
In 2012, he toured the Jefferson North Assembly Plant in Detroit that built the vehicle — a tour he followed up with a speech near the assembly line.
The first new car I ever bought was a Grand Cherokee,”he said to thunderous applause, while starting his speech.
Up until that point, I had some old beat-upused cars.”President Obama went on to say that he remembers “walking into that showroom and driving out with that new car… it had that new car smell, and everything worked.” President Obama also smiled as he told gathered factory workers that he has “some good memories of that car.”After the Grand Cherokee, President Obama moved on to anotherChryslerproduct: aV8-powered 300C sedan, which failed to sell on eBay in 2012with a $1-million starting bid.
These days, President Obama has no say in his desired vehicle — he’s shuttled everywhere in theCadillac-badged presidential limo, nicknamed the Beast.Find a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee for saleMORE FROMOVERSTEER:This Art Piece Depicts the Slowest Volkswagen Golf Crash EverThe Tesla Model S Is Absolutely Not the Best-Selling Luxury Sedan in America7 Crazy Luxury and Performance Cars With a CPO or CarMax WarrantyDoug DemuroDoug DeMuro writes articles and makes videos, mainly about cars.

It was in that moment that she knew: "Life with Barack would never be dull," the former first lady wrote in her new book "Becoming.
The two had recently started dating, having met in 1989 after Barack took a summer position as an associate at Chicago law firm Sidley Austin where Michelle was a first-year lawyer.Barack, 28, lived frugally as a "loan-strapped" student.
Still, when she arrived in Cambridge, Massachusetts to visit after he returned to law school, she was surprised to see the condition of his rusted, beat up car, bought used on his student budget.
She asked, in awe, "You drive this thing?
Smiling, the future president turned the key in his Datsun.
The engine revved and the car spasmed violently before settling into a loud, sustained juddering that shook us in our seats," wrote Michelle.
Just give it a minute or two," he assured her.
It goes away.
After they waited for the car to start, Barack then warned her to avoid the "rusted-out, four-inch hole" in the car's floor.
Through it, Michelle said she "could see the pavement rushing beneath us.
The experience, combined with his confidence, charmed her.
At 25, Michelle found early success with law and the perks that came with it, including an office in a high-rise and her own assistant.
On her new salary, one higher than her parents ever made, she could now afford a brand new Saab and pay her student loans.
Still, despite her success and hard work, she said her passion for law was low.By contrast, Barack seemed assured of his path, even without Michelle's same "lockstep march" to success.
He didn't talk about buying material things, even shoes, and spent most of his money on books, "sacred objects," that he'd read late into the night.
Wrote Michelle, he was "like a unicorn.
It did occur to Michelle that Barack might never make any money, she wrote, but the idea of life with him seemed exciting.
It would be some version of banana yellow and slightly hair-raising," she wrote.
I knew it even then.
The two would marry in 1992.
Barack's vows would not promise riches, but only an interesting life.Said Michelle, "On that promise, he delivered.

All rights reserved.Obama's First Ford 'Rattled and Shook'ByDevin DwyerMarch 23, 2012(Image credit: thebestofmyself/Flickr)President Obama kicked hisPR campaignon gas prices into a higher gear Wednesday, giving what is believed to be the first ever presidential interview to AAA.
I understand what folks are going through because it wasn't that long ago that I was having to fill up my gas tank and drive to work, shuttle the kids back and forth to school or events, and it takes a big bite out of folks paychecks," Obama told the motorist group, which has 53 million members.The interview, which appears online and in AAA publications today, is the latest indication that Obama is worried about rising gas prices and their political impact headed into the summer and fall.Sixty-five percent of Americans say they disapprove of Obama's handling of gas prices in thelatest ABC News-Washington Post poll.
Twenty-six percent approve.Obama told AAA, as he has repeatedly in the past few days, that his"all-of-the-above" approachto energy production will eventually help the country avoid gas price spikes in the long term.
He has said there are no "silver bullets" in the short term.The president also recalls his former membership in AAA and driving his first car, his grandfather's 1970s Ford Granada.
The Ford Granada was not the peak of Detroit engineering," he said.
It rattled and it shook, and I don't think the girls were particularly impressed when I came to pick them up in a Ford Granada," he said.
But you know what?
It moved and so I have fond memories of the fact that it got me to where I needed to go.
That's about all I can say about the Ford Granada.

Obama's Personal Finances: My First Car Had a 'Hole in the Floor'HOMEMAILNEWSFINANCESPORTSENTERTAINMENTLIFESEARCHSHOPPINGYAHOO PLUSMORE...Yahoo AutosYahoo AutosSearch querySign inMailSign into view your mailAutosReviewsBuyer's GuideVideosCars for Sale…AOL.comObama's Personal Finances: My First Car Had a 'Hole in the Floor'Read full articleBruce WatsonApril 5, 2012, 1:05 PM·3 min readObamaPolitics is a lucrative business:Senatorsare worth -- on average-- $13.2 million, while their poor cousins in the House of Representatives average a comparatively paltry $5.9 million in assets.
By comparison, the median household in American brings home only $49,445 per year.Given the huge wealth gap between average Americans and the legislators who represent them, one of the most amusing spectacles of any election cycle is watching rich politicians twist themselves into pretzels as they try to convince voters that they're "just folks."
On Wednesday, President Obama did his version of the dance in response to a reporter's question about his finances.The slur that Obama can't relate to average Americans is nothing new: He has been accused, variously, of being a snob, an elitist, and a post-colonialist Kenyan socialist.
Most recently, GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romneymade headlineswith his claim that "years of flying around in Air Force One, surrounded by an adoring staff of true believers" has left the president "out of touch" with common people.When a reporter brought up the criticism on Wednesday, Obama responded with an answer that touched on many of his common manbona fides:I went to law school and college with the help of scholarships; so did my wife.
We were still paying off student loans nine years after we graduated.
I bought my first car for about $900.
It had a big hole in the floor that allowed you to see the road, so I knew my wife wasn't marrying me for my money.
We had credit-card debt we hadn't paid off.
In fact] Our personal finances...weren't stable until fairly recently.The President proceeded to turn the critique back on Romney, a promising route, given that theRepublican challenger, whosenet worth is about $200 million,brought home $21.6 million in 2010, the majority of which came from his investments in the stock market.
That year, thePresident's earningswere $7.3 million, and largely came from royalties on his two books.Sponsored LinksBut what of the President's claim that his personal finances only recently stabilized?
This is harder to verify, as private citizens are not required to publicly disclose their wealth, butOpenSecrets.Orgreports that his earnings in 2004 totaled $112,431, and that his total assets were valued at between $200,000 and $400,000.Interestingly, this tempest over personal finances came on the heels of the passage of the "Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge" orSTOCK Act.
The law, which President Obama signed on Wednesday, requires many high-level government officials -- including senators, members of the House of Representatives, top executive branch officials and federal judges -- to disclose most financial transactions of more than $1,000.
Designed to halt insider trading by members of Congress, the law will also answer many questions about how much money government officials make -- and who is writing the checks.Bruce Watson is a senior features writer for DailyFinance.
