And still the same great burger. Happy Sunday!"—Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos)August 28, 2022Bezos started flipping burgers in 1980 in a McDonald's restaurant at the age of 16."I was a grill man and never worked the cash registers. The most challenging thing was keeping everything going at the right pace during a rush," he told Cody Teets for her book "Golden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers That Began at McDonald's."Bezos added: "The manager at my McDonald's was excellent. He had a lot of teenagers working for him, and he kept us focused even while we had fun."Bezos reportedly studied the fast-food chain's workflow technology and brainstormed improvements while working in the kitchen,Wired has reported.Despite his continued love of McDonald's burgers, there are some things that set the Amazon founder apart from most of the chain's customers.Earlier this year he came under fire for seeking to temporarilydismantle a historic bridgein Rotterdam so his new 417-foot megayacht could leave the shipyard where it was being constructed after being completed.The bridge, known as De Hef, is nearly 100 years old, and while it is no longer used has become a much-admired monument in the Dutch city.The yacht, known as Y721 and estimated to cost about $500 million,quietly left the Dutch shipyardbefore being finished without the bridge being dismantled.Sign up for notifications from Insider!

      Bezos (pronounced bay-zohs), founder, chief executive office (CEO), and
      head cheerleader forAmazon.com, the Internet bookselling company he founded in 1995. With about $1
      million in capital, most borrowed from friends and family, Bezos built a
      multibillion-dollar empire in about five years and in doing so,
      revolutionized the way commerce is done on the Internet.Childhood YearsJeffrey Preston Bezos was born January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New
      Mexico. A year later, his parents divorced and since then he has never had
      contact with his biological father. Three years later, his mother, Jackie
      Gise, married Michael Bezos, who fled his native Cuba when he was fifteen
      years old."In early 1996 we were called Amazon.con, in '97
        Amazon.toast, and in 1999 it was Amazon.bomb. Then there was my personal
        favorite:Amazon.org, because clearly we're not for profit.… It still gets a
        ton of attention. I mean, you're still talking to me."Much of Jeff Bezos's relentless drive and ambition likely came from
      his new father, who was raised in a Catholic mission. Mike Bezos always
      strove to better himself, learning English 
       and working various odd jobs to pay for his education at the University
      of New Mexico at Albuquerque. After college, he became an engineer with
      Exxon Corporation, causing the family to move to Texas. After several
      years, another job transfer brought them to Florida, where Jeff Bezos
      attended Palmetto High School in Miami. Bezos was popular in school and
      became class president and valedictorian in his senior year.Early InnovatorBezos always had a knack for figuring out how things work. InJeff Bezos: King of Amazon,author Josepha Sherman writes, "From the time he was a toddler,
      Bezos was busy trying to change his world. He felt he was too old to sleep
      in a 'baby' crib, so he found a screwdriver and took the
      crib apart. Instead of getting mad, Bezos's family encouraged
      him."Bezos had a younger sister, Christina, and brother, Mark. When the young
      siblings learned to walk, they loved going into their brother's
      room because of all the fascinating "toys". To warn him that
      the children were coming, Jeff attached an alarm to his bedroom door that
      made a loud buzzing sound when someone entered.When Bezos was twelve he wanted something called an Infinity Cube. The
      device was a set of small motorized mirrors that reflected off one another
      so the images seemed to go on endlessly. It cost $20 but Bezos did not
      have enough money to buy it. Instead, he purchased mirrors and other parts
      with what money he had and constructed his own reflecting cube. He built
      other inventions, including amateur robots. At one point he had so much
      clutter in his bedroom, his parents made him move all of his half-finished
      devices and experiments into the garage.There are many similar stories surrounding Bezos's childhood years.
      He spent countless hours building models and an assortment of electronics
      kits. He worked on science projects, often coming up with his own
      "inventions." By the time he reached high school, he had
      turned the family garage into his personal science and electronics
      laboratory. Ironically, Bezos later would launchAmazon.comfrom his own garage.Enters PrincetonAfter graduating with honors from high school, Bezos decided to follow in
      the footsteps of Stephen Hawking and enroll in the physics program at
      Princeton University. He soon realized, however, that the subject was too
      difficult for him, so he switched to a double major in electronics and
      computer science. Bezos discovered he excelled at creating software
      programs. In 1986, he graduated with highest honors and Phi Beta Kappa
      (membership in a national honor society), earning degrees in electrical
      engineering and the still new field of computer science.Bezos turned down several job offers from large corporations and instead
      took a position with a newly formed fiber optic company, Fitel. His task
      was to help the company build a computer network specifically for
      international finance. In 1988, he took a job developing systems for
      managing investment funds at Banker's Trust in New York City. After
      two years, he moved to the Wall Street investment firm of D. E. Shaw
      & Company as a computer specialist. In 1992, at age twenty-eight,
      he became Shaw's youngest ever vice president; two years later he
      was promoted to senior vice president.Bezos and DisneyAt various times, Jeff Bezos dreamed of becoming a cowboy or an
        astronaut. He was a devotedStar Trekfan and went as far as naming his dog Kamala after a minor character
        from an episode ofStar Trek: The Next Generation.His heroesincluded American inventor Thomas Edison(1847-1931), astrophysicist Stephen Hawking (1942-), andWalt Disney(see entry), although he was no Mickey Mouse fan. Instead, he was
        fascinated with how Disney came up with the electronics and animatronics
        used in Disney World in Orlando, Florida."The thing that always amazed me [about Disney] was how powerful
        his vision was," Bezos said in aTimearticle. "He knew exactly what he wanted to build and teamed up
        with a bunch of really smart people and built it. Everyone thought it
        wouldn't work, and he had to persuade the banks to lend him $400
        million. But he did it." Many friendsandfamily members would likely say the same thing about Bezos and the way
        he tookAmazon.comfrom an idea to a multibillion-dollar enterprise. Bezos, however, did
        it much quicker than Disney.From Idea to RealityWhile at Shaw Bezos developed the idea that would eventually becomeAmazon.com. In 1994, he read an article about how the World Wide Web was growing by
      2,300 percent a year. He knew he had to tap into such a great potential
      for commerce but was unsure what type of business would work 
       best. He researched mail-order companies, believing their products would
      sell well on the Internet. After drawing up a list of twenty popular
      mail-order items, Bezos finally settled on books since the millions of
      titles in print offered an enormous potential for sales.On July 6,1995, Bezos launchedAmazon.com, named after the South American river, with financial and moral support
      from family and friends. The company operated out of the garage of the
      Bezos's two-bedroom home in suburban Seattle, Washington. With
      almost no publicity, sales took off immediately. "Within the first
      few days, I knew this was going to be huge," Bezos toldTime."It was obvious that we were onto something much bigger than we
      ever dared to hope."Person of the YearBy the end of 1999,Amazon.comhad become a multibillion-dollar corporation offering 3.5 million titles
      for sale. It had expanded into a variety of other merchandise, including
      music and videos, and had set up operations in Europe. Bezos's
      personal fortune alone was estimated at $10.5 billion. In the crowning
      achievement of his career,Timemagazine named Bezos its "Person of the Year" for 1999,
      proclaiming him king of cybercommerce.With success came adversity. The company became involved in several
      notable lawsuits filed by Barnes & Noble and Wal-Mart. But none of
      the problems compared to the biggest challenge of all: making the company
      profitable.Amazon.comlost money every year, including $1.4 billion in 2000. In 2001, the
      company laid off thirteen hundred workers and instituted other
      cost-cutting measures. The belt-tightening worked andAmazon.composted its first ever net profit of $5.1 million for the fourth quarter
      of 2001.Despite his hectic schedule, the head of the world's largest
        bookstore still finds time to read. Jeff Bezos buys about ten books a
        month although he reads only three. His favorites includeThe Remains of the Dayby Kazuo Ishiguro,Duneby Frank Herbert, andBuilt to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companiesby James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras.For the future, Bezos plans to makeAmazon.coma place people can buy anything they want on-line. And now that theCEO and founder Jeff Bezos is known for his sunny disposition and
            booming laugh.Reproduced by permission of the Corbis Corporation (Bellevue).company is firmly rooted, Bezos and his wife MacKenzie want to turn their
      attention to charitable work. "At some point, we want to figure out
      how to do philanthropic work that's highly leveraged," said
      Bezos. "It's very easy to give away money ineffectively. But
      doing it well requires at least as much attention and energy as building a
      successful company."For Further InformationBooksSaunders, Rebecca.Business theAmazon.comWay.London: Capstone Ltd., 1999.Sherman, Josepha.Jeff Bezos: King of Amazon.Brookfield, CT: Twenty-First Century Books, 2001.Spector, Robert.Amazon.com—Get Big Fast: Inside the Revolutionary Business Model That Changed the

He was high schoolvaledictorian, aNational Merit Scholar,[34][35]and aSilver Knight Awardwinner in 1982.[34]In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind wouldcolonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park".[36]In 1986, he graduatedsumma cum laudefromPrinceton Universitywith a 4.2GPAand aBachelor of Science in Engineeringdegree (B.S.E.) inelectrical engineeringandcomputer science; he was also a member ofPhi Beta Kappa.[37][38]While at Princeton, Bezos was a member of theQuadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[39]In addition, he was elected toTau Beta Piand was the president of the Princeton chapter of theStudents for the Exploration and Development of Space(SEDS).[40][41]Business careerEarly careerAfter Bezos graduated from college in 1986, he was offered jobs atIntel,Bell Labs, andAndersen Consulting, among others.[42]He first worked at Fitel, afintechtelecommunicationsstart-up, where he was tasked with building a network forinternational trade.[43]Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter. He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager atBankers Trustfrom 1988 to 1990. He then joinedD. E. Shaw & Co, a newly createdhedge fundwith a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling from 1990 until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president by age 30.[44][42]AmazonMain article:AmazonBezos (front row, center) at the Robot Co-op in 2005In late 1993, Bezos read that the Internet was growing at a rate of 2300% a year and decided to establish anonline bookstore.[45]He and his then-wife,MacKenzie Scott, left their jobs at D. E. Shaw and founded Amazon in a rented garage inBellevue, Washington on July 5, 1994, after writing itsbusiness planon a cross-country drive from New York City toSeattle.[46][47]With Bezos at the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company's first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially.[48]Prior to settling on Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at anIndian reservationnearSan Franciscoin order to avoid paying taxes.[49]Bezos initially named his new companyCadabrabut later changed the name toAmazonafter theAmazon Riverin South America, in part because the name begins with the letterA, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[50]At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with "A" would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches.[51]In addition, he regarded "Amazon," the name of the world's largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world's largest online bookstore.[51]He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents as investment in Amazon.[47][52][53]He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[54]Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[44][50]Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with aninitial public offering(IPO).[55]In response to critical reports fromFortuneandBarron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such asBordersandBarnes & Noble.[50]In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company's products to include a variety of otherconsumer goods.[50]Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company's 1997equity offeringto finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[50]In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350 million.[56]In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launchAmazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels andwebsite traffic.[50]In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[57]After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[56]In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400 million.[58][failed verification]In November 2007, Bezos launched theAmazon Kindle.[59]According to a 2008Timeprofile, Bezos wished to create a device that allowed a "flow state" in reading similar to the experience of video games.[60]In 2013, Bezos secured a $600-million contract with theCentral Intelligence Agency(CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[61]In October of that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[62]Bezos in 2010In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[63]On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7 million.[64]A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[65]By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109 billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular,Blue Origin.[66]On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon'sSuper Bowl commercial.[67]On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterlyearningsof $2 billion.[68]Due to the growth ofAlibabain China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon intoIndia.[69]On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became theworld's wealthiest personoverMicrosoftco-founderBill Gateswhen his estimatednet worthincreased to just over $90 billion. His wealth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world byForbeson March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112 billion.[70]Bezos receives theJames Smithson Bicentennialmedal on June 14, 2016, for his work with Amazon.[71]In March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon's global senior vice president, to India with $5.5 billion to localize operations throughout the company'ssupply chainroutes.[72]Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon and Bezos, specifically ofsales taxavoidance, misusingpostal routes, andanti-competitivebusiness practices.[73]Amazon's share price fell by 9% in response to the President's negative comments; this reduced Bezos's personal wealth by $10.7 billion.[74]Weeks later, Bezos recouped his losses when academic reports out ofStanford Universityindicated that Trump could do little to regulate Amazon in any meaningful way.[75]During July 2018, a number of members of the U.S. Congress called on Bezos to detail the applications of Amazon'sface recognitionsoftware,Rekognition.[76]Bezos on October 25, 2017, on his visit toLos Angeles Air Force Base.[77]Criticism of Amazon's business practices continued in September 2018 when SenatorBernie Sandersintroduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receivingcorporate welfare.[78]This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers inArizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers inPennsylvaniaandOhio, relied on food stamps.[79]While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: "Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?"[80]He later said: "Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America."[81]Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary "misleading" as it included part-time workers.[82]However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[83]On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[84]The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour, a decision that was interpreted as support for theFight for $15movement.[85]In February 2021, Bezos announced that in thethird quarterof 2021 he would step down from his role as CEO of Amazon to become the Executive Chairman of the Amazon Board. He was succeeded as CEO byAndy Jassy.[86][87][88]On February 2, 2021, Bezos sent an email[89]to all Amazon employees, telling them the transition would give him "the time and energy [he] need[s] to focus on theDay 1 Fund, theBezos Earth Fund,Blue Origin,The Washington Post, and [his] other passions."[90]Blue OriginMain article:Blue OriginBezos andRob Meyerson(fifth from left) giving NASA Deputy AdministratorLori Garver(fourth from left) a tour of Blue Origin's crew capsule in 2011U.S. Secretary of DefenseAsh Cartermeets with Bezos in 2016 atThe Pentagon.In September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, ahuman spaceflightstartup.[91]Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel and the development of human life in the Solar System.[35]His 1982 high schoolvaledictoriansenior graduation speech was followed up with aMiami Heraldinterview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for human beings who were in orbit.[92]The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse throughresource depletion.[93]Rob Meyersonled Blue Origin from 2003 to 2017 and served as its first president.[94]After its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006 when it purchased a large tract of land inWest Texasfor a launch and test facility.[95]After the company gained the public's attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing thecost of space travelfor humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[96]In September 2011, one of the company's uncrewed prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight. Although the crash was viewed as a setback, news outlets noted how far the company went from its founding-to-date in advancingspaceflight.[97]After the crash, Bezos has been superstitiously wearing his "lucky" TexasCowboy bootsto all rocket launches.[98]In May 2013, Bezos met withRichard Branson, chairman ofVirgin Galactic, to discuss commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies.[99]He has been compared to Branson andElon Muskas all three are billionaires who prioritize spaceflight among their business interests.[100]In 2015, Bezos announced that a neworbital launch vehiclewas under development and would make its first flight in the late-2010s.[101]Later in November, Blue Origin'sNew Shepardspace vehicle successfully rocketed into space and reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers) before executing avertical landingback at the launch site in West Texas. In 2016, Bezos allowed select journalists to visit, tour, and photograph his facility.[102]He has repeatedly called for increased inter-space energy and industrial manufacturing to decrease the negative costs associated withbusiness-related pollution.[103]In December 2017, New Shepard successfully flew and landeddummy passengers, amending and pushing its human space travel start date into late 2018.[104]To execute this program, Blue Origin built six of the vehicles to support all phases of testing and operations: no-passenger test flights, flights with test passengers, and commercial-passenger weekly operations.[105]Since 2016, Bezos has spoken more freely about his hopes tocolonize the solar system, and has been selling US$1 billion in Amazon stock each year to capitalize Blue Origin in an effort to support this endeavor.[106][107]In May 2018, Bezos maintained that the primary goal of Blue Origin is to preserve thenatural resources of Earthby making the human speciesmulti-planetary.[108]He announced thatNew Shepardwould begin transporting humans intosub-orbital spaceby November 2018.[108]In July 2018, it was announced that Bezos had priced commercial spaceflight tickets from $200,000 to $300,000 per person.[109]On July 20, 2021, he launched on theNS-16mission with his half-brother Mark Bezos,Wally Funk, andOliver Daemen.[110]He launched nine days afterRichard Bransonlaunched onboard theVirgin Galactic Unity 22mission.

Bezos was a multi-billionaire who drove a 1996Honda Accord.[139]Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[140][141][142]Bezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[143][144]This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman, who described him as "talking in lists" and "[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made."[140]Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrotea bookthat described Bezos as a demanding boss as well ashyper-competitive,[136][143]and opined that Bezos perhaps "bet the biggest on the Internet" than anyone else.[145]Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles andexternalities.[146][147]During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to weartailored clothing; heweight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[148]His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as themetonymof the company.[149][150]His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has beenparodiedas an enterprisingsupervillain.[151][152][153]Since 2017, he has been portrayed byKyle MooneyandSteve CarellonSaturday Night Live, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure.[154][better source needed]In May 2014, theInternational Trade Union Confederationnamed Bezos the "World's Worst Boss", with its general secretarySharan Burrowsaying: "Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model",[155]while in 2019,Harvard Business Review, which ranked Bezos the best-performing CEO for 4 years in a row since 2014, did not rank him even in the top 100, citing Amazon's "relatively low ESG (environment,social, andgovernance) scores" that reflect "risks created byworking conditionsand employment policies,data security, andantitrustissues."[156]During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses.[27]His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016.[157][27]Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing aNew York Timespiece.[158][159]Leadership style"Day 1" Management PhilosophyDay 1:start upDay 2:stasisDay 3:irrelevanceDay 4: "excruciating, painful decline"Day 5:deathBezos has stated "it is always Day 1" to describe hisgrowth mindset.[160][161]Bezos used what he called a "regret-minimization framework" while he worked atD. E. Shawand again during the early years of Amazon. He described thislife philosophyby stating: "When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes."[162]During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.[38]To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed themantra"Get Big Fast", establishing the company's need toscaleits operations to produce market dominance.[50]He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form ofdividends.[140]Bezos uses the term "work–life harmony" instead of the more standard "work–life balance" because he believes thatbalanceimplies that you can only have one and not the other. He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other.[163]JournalistWalt Mossbergdubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique shouldn't do anything new or interesting "The Bezos Principle".[164]Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule—a preference that meetings are small enough for twopizzasto feed everyone in the boardroom.[165]When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon, he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise thecommon standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.[166]In 2018, it was reported that he met with Amazon investors for just six hours a year.[165]Instead of usingpresentation slides, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives.[167]Since 1998, Bezos has published an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers, not competitors; take risks formarket leadership; facilitate staff morale; build acompany culture; and empower people.[168][169]Bezos maintains the email address jeff@amazon.com[170]as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company. Although he does not respond to the emails, he forwards some of them with a question mark in the subject line to executives who attempt to address the issues.[171]Bezos has citedJeff ImmeltofNew Enterprise Associates,[172]Warren BuffettofBerkshire Hathaway,Jamie DimonofJPMorgan Chase, andBob IgerofThe Walt Disney Companyas major influences on his leadership style.[172][173]RecognitionIn 1999, Bezos received his first major award whenTimenamed himPerson of the Year.[174]In 2008, he was selected byU.S. News & World Reportas one of America's best leaders.[175]Bezos was awarded an honorary doctorate in science and technology fromCarnegie Mellon Universityin 2008.[176]In 2011,The Economistgave Bezos and Gregg Zehr an Innovation Award for theAmazon Kindle.[177]In 2012, Bezos was named Businessperson of the Year byFortune.[178]He is also a member of theBilderberg Groupand attended the 2011 Bilderberg conference inSt. Moritz, Switzerland,[179]and the2013 conferenceinWatford, Hertfordshire, England.

However, in July 2018, the net worth of Bezos officially surpassed the $150 billion mark, which led most major wealth indexes to label him the wealthiest person in modern history (post-1982).[221]References^Jonge, Peter de (March 14, 1999)."Riding the Wild, Perilous Waters of Amazone.com".The New York Times.ISSN0362-4331.

The rest is history.byAnne DennonAnne DennonRead Full BioWriterAnne Dennon covers higher education trends, policy, and student issues for BestColleges.

But behind his mythic origins is a journey that shows the power of education to inform and inspire.The importance of education was instilled in Bezos from a young age.Bezos was born to a single teen momwho completed high school and later brought her baby along when she attended night classes. Growing up, Bezos attended publicschools in Texasand Florida.In high school, Bezos worked thebreakfast shift at McDonald'sas a short-order cook. He was a high-achieving student, becoming aNational Merit Scholarand a member of the honor societyPhi Beta Kappa.Likewise, while still in high school, Bezos participated in the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. In hisvaledictorian speech, he talked about colonizing space as a way to save the Earth.Where Did Jeff Bezos Go to College?When Bezos enrolled atPrinceton University, he set out to study space as a physics major.Inspired by Stephen Hawking, he dreamt of becoming a theoretical physicist and ran the Princeton chapter of Students for the Exploration and Development of Space.However, it wasn't long beforeBezos realizedhe would never be at the top of his field in physics. He wanted to go where he could "make a contribution," so he switched to double majoring inelectrical engineeringand computer science. Bezos was elected to Tau Beta Pi — the engineering honor society — and graduated in 1986 summa cum laude.Bezos fielded job offers from Intel and Bell Labs, but opted to work for a fintech startup. After that, Bezos joined a nascent hedge fund experimenting with mathematical modeling.In late 1993, 30-year-old Bezos left his position as a senior vice president of the firm. He took $300,000 in seed money from his parents, made a cross-country road trip to Seattle, andstarted Amazon.comout of his garage.Bezos never returned to academia, but received an honorary doctorate in science and technology fromCarnegie Mellon Universityin 2008. A decade later, Bezos was elected to theNational Academy of Engineering.Bezos' Goals Stem From Princeton Physics ProfessorAmazon expanded beyond books to other consumer goods, and then began to grow into increasingly diverse industries. Once upon a time Amazon nearly went bankrupt, but soonrebounded to twice its former strength. Today, the tech giant shows no signs of flagging. Although the average household debt in the U.S. has risen dramatically since early 2020,Bezos' wealth has grownby 70% since the beginning of the pandemic.Amazon's success funds Bezos' real ambitions — the space missions he fixated on as a student but put aside when he switched majors.In 1976, four years before Bezos arrived on campus, Princeton physicist Gerard K. O'Neill published a book detailing plans to move into space — "The High Frontier." Bezosattended some of O'Neill's seminars. Through Blue Origin, Bezos' space flight company, he's taking steps toward realizing O'Neill's vision.While Bezos controls huge swathes of e-commerce, book sales, and video streaming, it's his forays into cloud-computing, artificial intelligence, and space travel that receive most of his attention. In July, Bezos stepped down as CEO of Amazon tofocus on his passions, including his newspaper The Washington Post, prolonging life, and going to space.His last letter to shareholdersquoted geneticist Richard Dawkins: "Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at... If living things don't actively work to prevent it, they would eventually merge with their surroundings and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die."Bezos recently helped launchAltos Labs, a biotechnology company looking to develop therapy to reprogram aging cells. Bezos is also a major investor inUnity Biotechnology, a life-extension research firm exploring how to slow or stop aging.Criticized for Business Practices, Bezos Invests in EducationBezos' reputation as aruthless bosshas far-reaching implications that impact the working class on a large scale. For example, the nonprofit group New Food Economy found that one-third of Amazon workers in Arizona, as well as one-tenth of Amazon workers in Pennsylvania and Ohio,rely on food stamps.In 2018, Senator Bernie Sanders introduced theStop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies(Stop BEZOS) Act, which would have required major employers like Amazon to reimburse the government for the food stamps and other federal benefits that their workers receive. While president,Donald Trump accused Bezosof sales tax avoidance.Around the same time thatBezos dropped offthe Harvard Business Review's rankings of best-performing CEOs — due to "working conditions and employment policies, data security, and antitrust issues" — Bezos made his first major forays into philanthropy.In January 2018, Bezos made a$33 million donation to TheDream.US, a college scholarship fund for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. That September, Bezos unveiled a $2 billion "Day One" fund that focuses on homelessness and establishing Montessori-inspiredpreschools for low income communities.Feature Image: EMMANUEL DUNAND / Staff / AFP / Getty ImagesLatest NewsAs Employers Drop Degree Requirements, Having a Bachelor's Remains Valuable: ReportBest College Student Discounts: Your .edu Email Can Unlock Big SavingsBiden's Proposed Title IX Transgender Athlete Rule Draws Criticism From Politicians, AdvocatesFive University Presidents Announced Resignations in First Week of AprilRelated StoriesDid Elon Musk Go to College?Where Did Trump Go to College?Cannabis Use, Courses Grow on College CampusesFeatured StoriesShootings at Colleges: U.S. StatisticsUSC and 2U Sued for Alleged U.S. News Rankings FraudTentative Agreements Emerge Between Academic Workers and University of CaliforniaWhy the Supreme Court Can't Fully Prevent Race-Conscious AdmissionsLatest AnalysisOnline Program Managers: What Are OPMs in Higher Education?Common App Sees Rise in International ApplicantsPickleball Gaining Popularity on College CampusesSurvey Finds 82% of Student-Parents Are Living Below the Poverty LineData StudiesView allOnly 1 in 4 Students Support Legislative Efforts to Limit DEI on College CampusesTikTok Ban Would Anger Most College Students: 6 Key Survey FindingsHalf of College Students Say Using AI on Schoolwork Is Cheating or PlagiarismFuture of Work and Learning: The Big BlurFooterBestcolleges HomeAbout UsMedia and PressAdvertising DisclosureDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationOur ContributorsPress ReleasesAdvertise With UsCookie SettingsRankings MethodologyContact UsPrivacy PolicySitemapPartner with UsTerms of ServiceEditorial PolicyFacebookTwitterInstagramYoutube© 2023 BestColleges.com, a Red Ventures Company

He was born the son of a 16-year-old mom and deadbeat dad. And he didn't set out to be the CEO of an e-commerce juggernaut.Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff BezosPhoto by Bloomberg"I won the lottery with my mom. Thanks for literally everything, Mom"Jeff Bezos was born on January 12, 1964, as Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen. His biological dad, Ted Jorgensen, met and started dating his mother, Jacklyn Gise, when they were both in high school. Jorgensen was 18 and Gise was 16 when she became pregnant. They flew to Mexico with their parents' money to get married.Jorgensen belonged to a unicycle troupe and worked at a retail store making $1.25 an hour, so he didn't have much money. He was also "had a habit of drinking too much," according to"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon," by journalist and biographer Brad Stone. When Jeff Bezos was 17 months old, his mom divorced Jorgensen.In 1968, Gise remarried Miguel Bezos, who arrived in Miami in 1962 from Cuba knowing only one word of English: "hamburger." Jorgensen agreed to let Bezos adopt his son and, at 4 years old, Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen became Jeffrey Preston Bezos.Biographer Stone suggests that Bezos' childhood may have contributed to his obsession with success. "It is of course unknowable whether the unusual circumstances of his birth helped to create that fecund entrepreneurial mix of intelligence, ambition, and a relentless need to prove himself. Two other technology icons, Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison, were adopted, and the experience is thought by some to have given each a powerful motivation to succeed," Stone writes.Growing up, Bezos spent summers with his grandparents on their Texas ranch,he says in the commencement speechhe gave at Princeton in 2010. "I helped fix windmills, vaccinate cattle, and do other chores. We also watched soap operas every afternoon, especially 'Days of our Lives,'" says Bezos.Bezos would also occasionally get to road trip with his grandparents."My grandparents belonged to a Caravan Club, a group of Airstream trailer owners who travel together around the U.S. and Canada. And every few summers, we'd join the caravan,"Bezos says in graduation speech. "We'd hitch up the Airstream trailer to my grandfather's car, and off we'd go, in a line with 300 other Airstream adventurers. I loved and worshipped my grandparents and I really looked forward to these trips."Launching Amazon: "I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice"Bezos got straight As in high school, was the valedictorian of his class and was accepted early admission to Princeton, according to Stone's biography. For a time in college,he thought he would be a theoretical physicist.But it was years later, while working in finance in New York City that he had the idea to start Amazon."I came across the fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year. I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles — something that simply couldn't exist in the physical world — was very exciting to me," says Bezos, in his 2010 Princeton address.At the time, Bezos was just 30 and had been married for a year. "I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go do this crazy thing that probably wouldn't work since most startups don't, and I wasn't sure what would happen after that," he says.After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.Jeff Bezosfounder of Amazon, Blue OriginHis wife told him to go for it."As a young boy,I'd been a garage inventor. I'd invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker that didn't work very well out of an umbrella and tinfoil, baking-pan alarms to entrap my siblings," he says. "I'd always wanted to be an inventor, and she wanted me to follow my passion."But not everyone was on board. Bezos boss took a walk through Central Park and told Bezos that, while it sounded like a "really good idea," it would be an even better idea for somebody who didn't already have a good career."That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision,"says Bezos. "Seen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing. And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all."After much consideration,I took the less safe pathto follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice."The early days of Amazon: "I thought maybe one day we would be able to afford a forklift"When Amazon first started, it sold only books. Bezos would drive the packages to the post office himselfin his 1987 Chevy Blazer. "I thought maybe one day we would be able to afford a forklift,"Bezos tells Charlie Rosein a wide-ranging interview in 2016. "And it is very, it's very, very different today."After books, the next items Bezos added to Amazon were music and videos. Then, he asked customers to see what else they would want to buy from the online retailer."I sent an email message out to the customer base, actually a thousand randomly selected customers, and I said, besides books, music and video, what would you like to see us sell? And the list came back incredibly long," explains Bezos."It was basically just whatever the person had on their mind right now," says Bezos, and that sparked an idea.VIDEO1:0501:05Here's what makes up the Jeff Bezos empireThe Definitive Guide to Business"One of customers said, 'I wish you sold windshield wipers because I need windshield wipers for my car.' A light kind of went on in my head. You know, people — people will want to use this new fangled e-commerce way of shopping for everything,"Bezos says to Rose."People are very convenience-motivated," says Bezos. "So that really started the kind of the expansion into all categories, consumer electronics, and then apparel, and so on."Expand he did. Today, Amazon sells almost everything. From toilet paperto groceriesto electronics to fashion to furniture.When Bezos enters a new product category, he is not intimidated by a lack of expertise."I am never disappointed when we're not good at something because I think, well think how good it's going to work when we are good at it,"Bezos tells Rose. "And the apparel is like that. There is so much opportunity. Nobody really knows how to do a great job of offering — apparel online yet. And we have tons of invention and ideas and working our way through that experimental list."Amazon's North star: "Customer obsession, as opposed to competitor obsession"Bezos has always been a rare combination of optimistic, idealistic and visionary.Back in 2003, while much of the tech industry was still hungover from the dot-com bust, Bezos was aggressively foretelling the potential of the Internet. "I do think there's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us,"says Bezos in a TED Talkhe gave that year. "We're very, very early."As Bezos charged full force into the Wild West that was the Internet then, he was — and still is today — guided by a single belief: Do what is best for the customer."Thing that connects everything that Amazon does is the number one — our number one conviction and idea and philosophy and principle which is customer obsession, as opposed to competitor obsession. And so we are always focused on the customer, working backwards from the customer's needs, developing new skills internally so that we can satisfy what we perceive to be future customer needs,"Bezos tells Rose.Another through line to Bezos' business strategy is his "willingness to think long-term," he says."We are very happy to invest in new initiatives that are very risky, for five to seven years, which most companies won't do that,"Bezos tells Rose. "It's the combination of the risk-taking and the long-term outlook that make Amazon, not unique, but special in a smaller crowd."Finally, he's obsessive about finding problems and fixing them."Taking real pride in operational excellence, so just doing things well, finding defects and working backwards — that is all the incremental improvement that in business, most successful companies are very good at this one. ... [Y]ou don't want to ever let defects flow downstream,"Bezos says to Rose. "That is a key part of doing a good job in any business in my opinion."VIDEO0:5100:51The evolution of Jeff Bezos: See if you can recognize him through the yearsDigital OriginalFrom e-commerce to mediaAs consumer behavior on the web has evolved, so, too has Amazon. Prime, the e-commerce's populartwo-day shipping membershipcomes with access to premium television shows, for example.Being a content creator built on the back of an e-commerce giant gives Amazon freedom to be creative. For example, one of Amazon's most popular shows, "Transparent," is about a patriarch who becomes a woman later in life. It's won eight Emmys and beennominated for another 28."A show like 'Transparent' which has won Golden Globes and Emmys is not ever — it is not a show that could be successfully done on broadcast TV, because broadcast TV needs a much bigger audience,"says Bezos to Rose. "And so you can actually think about the creative process a little differently. You can attract different storytellers. You can go for stories that are narrower but incredibly powerful and well told."In addition to producing online shows, Bezos is also the owner of another kind of content: journalism. Through his Nash Holdings LLC, hebought the Washington Postin 2013 for $250 million."I bought it because it's important," says Bezos. "I would never buy a financially upside down salty snack food company. You know, that doesn't make any sense to me. But The Washington Post is important. And so it makes sense to me to take something like that, and I also am optimistic. And I thought there were some ways to make it — I want it to be a self-sustaining, profitable enterprise," Bezos says to Rose. "And I think it can be done."Bezos' empire now stretches far and wide. Amazon, which currently has amarket cap of more than $500 billion,bought Whole Foods in Augustand also owns companies like Zappos and Twitch. ThroughBezos Expeditions, he's also invested in companies like Twitter and Basecamp,among many others.The final frontier: "I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5"While shipping toiletries and downloading books hasmade Bezos wealthy, his passion is outer space.Buzz Aldrin dropped by Blue Origin HQ to say hi to the team yesterday."This is a childhood dream,"Bezos says to Rose. "I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5 years old. I watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon. You don't choose your passions, your passions choose you. So I am infected with this idea. I couldn't ever stop thinking about space. I have been thinking about it ever since then."To that end, Bezos is the founder ofBlue Origin, a company that aims tomake space tourism affordable."Basically what I am doing right now is taking my Amazon winnings and investing them. Every time you see me sell stock on Amazon, it's send more money to the Blue Origin team,"Bezos says to Rose.In addition to making it possible for more people to travel to space, Bezos says he is building the infrastructure for the next generation of space entrepreneurs."[I]f I'm 80 years old, looking back on my life and the one thing I have done is make it so that there is this gigantic entrepreneurial explosion in space for the next generation," says Bezos, "I will be a happy, happy man."See also:How Jeff Bezos, now the richest person in the world, spends his billions12 books that shaped the way Jeff Bezos, now the world's richest man, thinks about successJeff Bezos is now the richest man in the world—and he could also become the first trillionaireVIDEO0:5200:52Jeff Bezos now the world's richest man based on stock wealthSquawk BoxLike this story?

We can now add Bezos’s reading list to similar ones fromSteve JobsandBill Gates.The Remains of the day, by Kazuo IshiguroJeff Bezos’s favorite novel, about a butler who wistfully recalls his career in service during wartime Great Britain. Bezos has said he learns more from novels than nonfiction.Sam Walton: Made in America, by Sam WaltonIn his autobiography, Walmart’s founder expounds on the principles of discount retailing and discusses his core values of frugality and a bias for action—a willingness to try a lot of things and make many mistakes. Bezos included both in Amazon’s corporate values.Memos from the Chairman, by Alan GreenbergA collection of memos to employees by the chairman of the now defunct investment bank Bear Stearns. In his memos, Greenberg is constantly restating the bank’s core values, especially modesty and frugality. His repetition of wisdom from a fictional philosopher presages Amazon’s annual recycling of its original 1997 letter to shareholders.The Mythical Man-Month, by Frederick P. Brooks Jr.An influential computer scientist makes the counter-intuitive argument that small groups of engineers are more effective than larger ones at handling complex software projects. The book lays out the theory behind Amazon’s two pizza teams.Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies, by Jim CollinsThe famous management book about why certain companies succeed over time. A core ideology guides these firms, and only those employees who embrace the central mission flourish; others are “expunged like a virus” from the companies.Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap … and Others Don’t, by Jim CollinsCollins briefed Amazon executives on his seminal management book before its publication. Companies must confront the brutal facts of their business, find out what they are uniquely good at, and master their fly wheel, in which each part of the business reinforces and accelerates the other parts.Creation: Life and How to make it, By Steve GrandA video-game designer argues that intelligent systems can be created from the bottom up if one devises a set of primitive building blocks. The book was influential in the creation of Amazon Web Services, or AWS, the service that popularized the notion of the cloud.The Innovator’s Dilemma, by Clayton ChristensenAn enormously influential business book whose principles Amazon acted on and that facilitated the creation of the Kindle and AWS. Some companies are reluctant to embrace disruptive technology because it might alienate customers and undermine their core business, but Christensen argues that ignoring potential disruption is even costlier.The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvements, by Eliyahu GoldrattAn exposition of the science of manufacturing written in the guise of the novel, the book encourages companies to identify the biggest constraints in their operations and then structure their organizations to get the most out of those constraints. The Goal was a bible for Jeff Wilke and the team that fixed Amazon’s fulfillment network.Lean Thinking: Banish Waste and Create Wealth in Your Corporation, by James WomanckThe production philosophy pioneered by Toyota calls for a focus on those activities that create value for the customer and the systematic eradication of everything else.Data-Driven Marketing: The 15 Metrics Everyone in Marketing Should Know, by Mark JefferyA guide to using data to measure everything from customer satisfaction to the effectiveness of marketing. Amazon employees must support all assertions with data, and if the data has a weakness, they must point it out or their colleagues will do it for them.The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable, by Nassim TalebThe scholar argues that people are wired to see patterns in chaos while remaining blind to unpredictable events, with massive consequences. Experimentation and empiricism trumps the easy and obvious narrative.Read NextNext Post:Much of What You’re Going to Do or Say Today is Not EssentialIf you’re a modern knowledge worker, odds are you’re going to go to work, read some emails, reply to some emails, attend some …Discover What You’re MissingGet the weekly email full of actionable ideas and insights you can use at work and home.As seen on:© 2023 Farnam Street Media Inc.

He's also spent his career changing the way books are published and sold, devouring many small bookstores in the process.But the Amazon founder and CEO also has an abiding love of reading, and it has played a key role in forming him as a leader.In biography "The Everything Store," author Brad Stone describes how books shaped Bezos' leadership style and way of thinking. In fact, according to the book, there is a list of books Amazon employees refer to as "Jeff's Reading List."It includes autobiographies, business and technology reads and even a novel, and according to Stone, many Amazon executives have made their way through these volumes.How many of these have you read?1. "The Remains of the Day" by Kazuo IshiguroIshiguro's novel is a first-person narrative told by a butler who recalls his time serving in the army during the first World War. Stone writes that it is Bezos' favorite novel."Bezos has said he learns more from novels than nonfiction," Stone writes.2. "Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies" by Jim CollinsThis famous management read explains how companies that succeed build environments where "employees who embrace the central mission flourish," Stone writes.The key thing about a book is that you lose yourself in the author's world.Jeff Bezosfounder and CEO of Amazon3. "Creation: Life and How to Make It" by Steve Grand"A video game designer argues that intelligent systems can be created from the bottom up if one devises a set of primitive building blocks," Stone writes. "The book was influential in the creation of Amazon Web Services, or AWS, the service that popularized the notion of the cloud."4. "Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap … and Others Don't" by Jim CollinsAuthor and business consultant Collins briefed Amazon executives on many of the principles in this book before its publication, according to Stone.It explains how "companies must confront the brutal facts of their business, find out what they are uniquely good at, and master their flywheel, in which each part of the business reinforces and accelerates the other parts."5. "The Innovator's Dilemma" by Clayton ChristensenIn this book, Christensen argues that companies improve by embracing disruptive innovation. Michael Bloomberg, founder and CEO of the eponymous company,once describedthe book as "absolutely brilliant.""An enormously influential business book whose principles Amazon acted on and that facilitated the creation of the Kindle and [Amazon Web Services]," Stone writes. "Some companies are reluctant to embrace disruptive technology because it might alienate customers and undermine their core business, but Christensen argues that ignoring potential disruption is even costlier."6. "Sam Walton: Made in America" by Sam Walton"In his autobiography, Walmart's founder expounds on the principles of discount retailing and discusses his core values of frugality and a bias for action — a willingness to try a lot of things and make many mistakes," Stone writes. "Bezos included both in Amazon's corporate values."7. "Lean Thinking: Banish Waste and Create Wealth in Your Corporation" by James Womack and Daniel JonesThis book explores how major American, European and Japanese companies applied a series of "lean thinking" principles in an attempt to cut costs and boost efficiency to survive the 1991 recession and grow over the rest of the decade.8."Memos from the Chairman" by Alan Greenberg"[The book is] a collection of memos to employees by the chairman of the now defunct investment bank Bear Stearns," Stone writes. "In his memos, Greenberg is constantly restating the bank's core values, especially modesty and frugality."9. "The Mythical Man-Month" by Frederick P. Brooks, Jr."An influential computer scientist makes the counterintuitive argument that small groups of engineers are more effective than larger ones at handling complex software projects," Stone writes.10. "The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvements" by Eliyahu Goldratt"An exposition of the science of manufacturing written in the guise of the novel, the book encourages companies to identify the biggest constraints in their operations," Stone writes, "and then structure their organizations to get the most out of those constraints."11. "Data-Driven Marketing: The 15 Metrics Everyone in Marketing Should Know" by Mark Jeffery"[This is] a guide to using data to measure everything from customer satisfaction to the effectiveness of marketing," Stone writes. "Amazon employees must support all assertions with data, and if the data has a weakness, they must point it out or their colleagues will do it for them."12. "The Black Swan" by Nassim Taleb"The scholar argues that people are wired to see patterns in chaos while remaining blind to unpredictable events, with massive consequences. Experimentation and empiricism trumps the easy and obvious narrative," Stone writes.For Bezos, the most important thing a book can provide is an escape."The key thing about a book is that you lose yourself in the author's world," Bezos tellsThe Washington Post.Check outthe No. 1 takeaway from Bill Gates and Warren Buffett's favorite bookVIDEO0:5900:59This is the top lesson from Bill Gates and Warren Buffett's favorite business bookThe Definitive Guide to BusinessMore In How to Win in BusinessWhat this ex-Amazon employee learned from Jeff Bezos about building a multimillion-dollar start-upKaren Gilchrist32-year-old founders of multimillion-dollar app share their No. 1 tip for starting a businessKaren GilchristThis husband-and-wife team shares their tips for going into business togetherKaren GilchristRead MoreStay in the loopGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inboxSign UpAbout UsLearn more about the world of CNBC Make ItLearn MoreFollow UsCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel©2023CNBC LLC.

Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1964, Bezos remembers watching Neil Armstrong land on the moon in 1969."I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5 years old," Bezostells Charlie Rose. "I watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon. You don't choose your passions, your passions choose you. I — so I am infected with this idea. I couldn't ever stop thinking about space. I have been thinking about it ever since then."Jeff Bezos, founder and Ceo of AmazonPaul Souders | Getty ImagesBezos also remembers going through a phase in first grade when he was 6, where he wanted to be an archaeologist — because he had learned how to spell the word,according to a 2001 Guardian article.Later, Bezos was his high school's valedictorian, and then he went to Princeton, where he thought he would become a theoretical physicist. That didn't stick either, though."I was doing well, but it was so much work for me, it was hard and there were half a dozen people in my class who were so gifted, and their brains were just wired in a different way, and the things that I worked so hard to do came so effortlessly to them," says Bezos in the Guardian.I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5 years old.Jeff Bezosfounder of Amazon, Blue OriginThe experience was humbling for Bezos, who had previously far excelled easily."I would say it was a combination of shocking and awe inspiring. It was sort of, 'Wow, this is incredible that some people can process these incredibly abstract concepts so gracefully'... So anyway, I realized that I was going to be a mediocre theoretical physicist... Mediocre theoretical physicists make no progress. They spend all their time understanding other people's progress."When he decided to let go of his theoretical physicist dreams, Bezos switched his major to computer science, according to a 1999 feature fromWired. After college, Bezos worked for several years in finance, including at hedge fund D. E. Shaw, where he had the idea to sell books over the Internet, according to the Wired feature.The rest is history: Books became books and movies and music. And soon the e-commerce platform added more wares to its roster. Today, with amarket cap of about $500 billion, Amazon sells almost everything imaginable including groceries, toilet paper and furniture.And though Bezos has become a billionaire 90 times over thanks to e-commerce, he's still a space-junkie at heart."Basically what I am doing right now is taking my Amazon winnings and investing them,"Bezos says to Rose. "Every time you see me sell stock on Amazon, it's send more money to the Blue Origin team."See also:How Amazon founder Jeff Bezos went from the son of a teen mom to the world's richest personHow Jeff Bezos, now the richest person in the world, spends his billions12 books that shaped the way Jeff Bezos, now the world's richest man, thinks about successLike this story?

Ltd.Published May 4, 2022+ FollowSummary: Sometimes pearls of wisdom can help you in building a great life. Draw some inspiration from these five quotes by Jeff Bezos.In this digital world, the name of Jeff Bezos needs no introduction. The CEO and founder of Amazon is a popular figure. During the pandemic, when most businesses were facing shutdowns, Amazon flourished courtesy of the services that it provided that were vital for the survival of our modern society.1. “Choosing to work hard is the key to being successful.”Growing up, Bezos says that his motto was "nil sine labore," which means “nothing without hard work.” He firmly believed that hard work has no replacement. Many people often ask him the difference between a gift and a skill. Or does being talented at something require effort on your part? To this, Bezos replies that when you have a gift and you still choose to work hard, you are going to leverage that gift.The world is full of people who have gifts but either they don’t realize their potential or don’t have the means to take full advantage of them. But there is one thing that everyone must know you have to put in the work every day to meet your goals.2. “No dream is too big.”We all have dreams. But some of us are afraid to chase them. However, having big dreams often act as a driving force to do something great in our lives. It gives a sense of purpose that we need to achieve every morning when we open our eyes. Some people dream of having a job, while others dream of giving something back to society. But no matter what that dream might be, it is up to us to figure out how to chase it and turn it into reality.With his Blue Origin`s New Shepard rocket ship, Jeff says he achieved his lifelong dream. Though not many of us dream about owning a rocket ship company, it is a pure example that no dream is too big. As they say, if we shoot for the moon, we might just land among the stars.3. Think bigger than yourself to understand the needs around youMany people understand, while accomplishing their goals that there is more to life than just what is right in front of them. Jeff Bezos shares that right after his trip to space, he was inspired to commit $ 10 billion to fight climate change in the next decade.Recently, he has taken a pledge to donate $2 billion to the cause of “restoring nature and transforming food systems.” We might not have billions to spend on a cause, but we can do what we surely can for a cause that we believe in. Whether it is replacing plastic bags with cloth bags or going green every small effort counts. It also gives us a new perspective to look beyond ourselves.4. “Don’t let your circumstances define you.”If you have seen this amazing case study on Jeff Bezos, you must have realized that he wasn’t born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He did not inherit a large, well-functioning business. Just like many of us, he was surrounded by many challenges. He was born to a 16-year-old mother and spent his summers working on his grandparents’ ranch during the summer.Smooth roads never make good drivers. The challenges that come in our lives make us stronger, smarter and more experienced.

[+]conference on September 6, 2012 in Santa Monica, California.  (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)Getty ImagesFew of us will ever have the opportunity to work side-by-side with one visionary billionaire throughout our career. Ann Hiatt worked for two of them: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.“The greatest gift in my life has been sitting next to the smartest CEOs in the world and learning step-by-step how they think, act, motivate, and make decisions,” Hiatt writes in her book,Bet On Yourself.I recently caught up with Hiatt to learn more about her experiences at Amazon and Google where she worked as the ‘right-hand’ for Bezos, Schmidt, and Marissa Mayer before Mayer left Google to become CEO of Yahoo.Hiatt offers six strategies that professionals should cultivate to build the career of their dreams.1. Prioritize learning.Hiatt sat three feet away from Jeff Bezos during Amazon’s hyper-growth period. What struck her most about Bezos is that he never stopped learning. Bezos walked into the office with three newspapers tucked under his arm. Hiatt would snag them off his desk and read them during her lunch break. By that time of day, Bezos had moved on to briefing documents, books, and scientific papers.MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your TaxesMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella once said that it’s better to be a “learn-it-all” instead of a “know-it-all.” Hiatt couldn’t agree more based on the CEOs she has worked with at Google and Amazon. Leaders who reach the top are life-long learners well after they complete their formal education.2. Surround yourself with brilliance.They say you’re the average of the five people you associate with the most, so choose that group wisely.“I always prioritized the type of people I wanted to work for over anything else, including the job title and salary,” Hiatt told me. “I knew they would shape the kind of person and leader I would become.”Hiatt and I agree that you don’t need to know the person to surround yourself with brilliant people and their ideas. Instead, follow great thinkers and leaders on social media, watch their speeches or lectures on YouTube and TED Talks, or take classes on platforms such as LinkedIn or Masterclass.“The Internet is the great equalizer in access to great thinking,” says Hiatt. Brilliance is all around you. Take advantage of it.3. Find meaningful impact.According to Hiatt, one way to get noticed in an organization is to identify overlooked opportunities to make an impact. These opportunities might come disguised in tasks that are not part of your job description. For example, in the tech companies she worked at, Hiatt volunteered to run ‘war rooms,’ meetings where top executives met to quickly fix problems or make big decisions.“I got access to the most powerful people in the company who also learned my name and recognized my value,” says Hiatt.Make yourself useful and absorb leadership lessons along the way.4. Follow the leader you want to become.Hiatt says if she had to pick just one strategy, this is it. “There are so many people who stagnate in their careers because they don’t seek out the leaders they want to become,” she says.After years of working for Google vice president Marissa Mayer, Hiatt chose to apply for the Chief of Staff position to Google CEO Eric Schmidt. After observing his management style, Hiatt decided that she could learn a lot by working with Schmidt side-by-side. The two remain close to this day (Schmidt wrote the forward to Hiatt’s book).Identify the people in an organization who reflect the traits you’d like to develop. Once you do, find a way to work for them or collaborate with them on projects.5.  Connect the opportunity dots.Steve Jobs told a Stanford graduating class that the milestones in your career would often connect, but it’s hard to see the connections until you look to the past.Hiatt says if those dots do, indeed, connect, then it’s worthwhile to set a North Star for yourself to avoid being blown off course. In other words, be the CEO of your own life: set goals, create a mission statement, and decide on your life’s driving purpose.According to Hiatt, “Life’s greatest joys follow once you have a dream so strong that it pulls you forward, rather than the other way around.”6. Make the ordinary extraordinary.Hiatt noticed a common habit among the top CEOs she worked for—they demanded excellence from every task, every meeting, and every presentation.Good isn’t good enough. About any project you’re working on, always yourself the following question:Is it excellent?Hiatt says that Bezos, Schmidt, and Mayer taught her that individuals can design their own careers and create their futures. Pay attention to the leaders you’d like to emulate and they’ll show you the path to a career of joy, adventure, and success.Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsiteor some of my other workhere.Carmine GalloEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

[+]conference on September 6, 2012 in Santa Monica, California.  (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)Getty ImagesFew of us will ever have the opportunity to work side-by-side with one visionary billionaire throughout our career. Ann Hiatt worked for two of them: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.“The greatest gift in my life has been sitting next to the smartest CEOs in the world and learning step-by-step how they think, act, motivate, and make decisions,” Hiatt writes in her book,Bet On Yourself.I recently caught up with Hiatt to learn more about her experiences at Amazon and Google where she worked as the ‘right-hand’ for Bezos, Schmidt, and Marissa Mayer before Mayer left Google to become CEO of Yahoo.Hiatt offers six strategies that professionals should cultivate to build the career of their dreams.1. Prioritize learning.Hiatt sat three feet away from Jeff Bezos during Amazon’s hyper-growth period. What struck her most about Bezos is that he never stopped learning. Bezos walked into the office with three newspapers tucked under his arm. Hiatt would snag them off his desk and read them during her lunch break. By that time of day, Bezos had moved on to briefing documents, books, and scientific papers.MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your TaxesMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella once said that it’s better to be a “learn-it-all” instead of a “know-it-all.” Hiatt couldn’t agree more based on the CEOs she has worked with at Google and Amazon. Leaders who reach the top are life-long learners well after they complete their formal education.2. Surround yourself with brilliance.They say you’re the average of the five people you associate with the most, so choose that group wisely.“I always prioritized the type of people I wanted to work for over anything else, including the job title and salary,” Hiatt told me. “I knew they would shape the kind of person and leader I would become.”Hiatt and I agree that you don’t need to know the person to surround yourself with brilliant people and their ideas. Instead, follow great thinkers and leaders on social media, watch their speeches or lectures on YouTube and TED Talks, or take classes on platforms such as LinkedIn or Masterclass.“The Internet is the great equalizer in access to great thinking,” says Hiatt. Brilliance is all around you. Take advantage of it.3. Find meaningful impact.According to Hiatt, one way to get noticed in an organization is to identify overlooked opportunities to make an impact. These opportunities might come disguised in tasks that are not part of your job description. For example, in the tech companies she worked at, Hiatt volunteered to run ‘war rooms,’ meetings where top executives met to quickly fix problems or make big decisions.“I got access to the most powerful people in the company who also learned my name and recognized my value,” says Hiatt.Make yourself useful and absorb leadership lessons along the way.4. Follow the leader you want to become.Hiatt says if she had to pick just one strategy, this is it. “There are so many people who stagnate in their careers because they don’t seek out the leaders they want to become,” she says.After years of working for Google vice president Marissa Mayer, Hiatt chose to apply for the Chief of Staff position to Google CEO Eric Schmidt. After observing his management style, Hiatt decided that she could learn a lot by working with Schmidt side-by-side. The two remain close to this day (Schmidt wrote the forward to Hiatt’s book).Identify the people in an organization who reflect the traits you’d like to develop. Once you do, find a way to work for them or collaborate with them on projects.5.  Connect the opportunity dots.Steve Jobs told a Stanford graduating class that the milestones in your career would often connect, but it’s hard to see the connections until you look to the past.Hiatt says if those dots do, indeed, connect, then it’s worthwhile to set a North Star for yourself to avoid being blown off course. In other words, be the CEO of your own life: set goals, create a mission statement, and decide on your life’s driving purpose.According to Hiatt, “Life’s greatest joys follow once you have a dream so strong that it pulls you forward, rather than the other way around.”6. Make the ordinary extraordinary.Hiatt noticed a common habit among the top CEOs she worked for—they demanded excellence from every task, every meeting, and every presentation.Good isn’t good enough. About any project you’re working on, always yourself the following question:Is it excellent?Hiatt says that Bezos, Schmidt, and Mayer taught her that individuals can design their own careers and create their futures. Pay attention to the leaders you’d like to emulate and they’ll show you the path to a career of joy, adventure, and success.Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsiteor some of my other workhere.Carmine GalloEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

You may know him as the founder of Amazon, the largest retailer in the world. His name? This extraordinary man goes by the name of none other than, Jeffrey Preston Bezos. We have come to know him as someone who has changed the way we shop forever, he continues to show us new ways to push the envelope and change the modern world. Who would have known the son of a teen mother would have become the man he is today. He was introduced to the world on January 12, 1964 in Albuquerque New Mexico. He was conceived by Jacklyn Bezos and her husband Ted Jorgensen.Years later, his mother married Miguel Bezos, a Cuban immigrant. This is where Jeff got the well known last name of Bezos. He attended Princeton University where he got his degree in electrical engineering and computer science. After graduating in 1986, Bezos went to Wall Street where he found a successful job. Not long after, he found himself, beheld with an idea that would change his life forever. That idea was Amazon. With the success his company brought him, he has found many ways to use his influence for the betterment of others, becoming a hero to many. A hero contains many traits. A few being, determination, resilience, passion, and care. Jeff Bezos is a modern day hero because of his unconditional care for others and his unbreakable determination.Jeff Bezos in his determined state of mindtheverge.comJeff Bezos has furthered his title as a modern day hero through his immense determination that has made him a fearless entrepreneur and innovator. His determination was proven to be useful as he struggled to make a decision to quit his Wall Street job to pursue his dream. “Seen in the light, it was a really difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn’t think I’d regret trying and failing. And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all”(Catherine Clifford para. 18) said Bezos. He was fixed with the decision to quit and pursue his dream or sit there and and watch it fade. But after seeing that Web usage had been growing by 2,300% a year, Bezos knew he had to do something about it. Bezos was able pursue his dream of Amazon because of his determination to start something new and his propensity to not fear failure. Bezos’ determination doesn’t stop there. When seem promoting his company, he is industriously trying to grow his company and spread the word of Amazon. “Analytical and Methodical, Bezos is also enthusiastic and tireless in promoting his company and the potential of the internet to change the way people buy”(Business Leader Profiles for Students para.3). Jeff Bezos shows his determination through his love and desire for his company. The amount of time and effort he has put forth for his company inspires all. His non-stop promoting, eagerness to change the way people shop, and his desire to be the best all stemmed from the eternal flame fueling his vision. It is through his heroic acts of determination and resilience that he inspires the youth to do more, and be more while simultaneously changing the world, furthering his status of hero.from a relentless boss to kind hearted manbusinessinsider.comJeff Bezos also demonstrates his unconditional desire for helping others as another one of his heroic abilities that makes him such an influential figure in today’s society. His willingness to try new things in order for them to have a positive effect on others has led him to his upcoming philanthropy plan, “As hard as it might be, reducing healthcare’s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort”(Jeff Bezos Biography.com-Entrepreneur, Business Leader para.22). While having less of an effect on the economy, Jeff Bezos’ philanthropy plan is aimed to help others in desperate need of health care. In doing so he uses the platform he has created to provide benefits for those who can’t support themselves. This exemplifies his caring nature in many ways, but the main reason is the fact he puts aside his own needs only to benefit others. A similar scenario in which Bezos exhibits his aide to society is one he takes across the globe. “...In early 2016, he flew his personal jet to Germany to pick up and bring home the Washington Post reporter who had been detained by Iran”(Avery Hartmans para. 32) Avery Hartman wrote. His efforts to reach this reporter were extensive. But without a shadow of a doubt, he was going to go retrieve the reporter. Bezos wasn’t obligated to go get him, no one was. But he did anyways. If it wasn’t for Bezos, who knows what could have happened to that reporter. As demonstrated by Bezos, kindness and giving back can go a long way, literally. Through Jeff Bezos’ dearest efforts, he has been a quintessential example of how to treat others in a caring manner; putting society on a path toward great things.To conclude, Jeff Bezos, in many ways, has shown us what it is like to be a modern day hero. Whether it was through his determination or his concern for others, he has demonstrated many acts of one. Ranging from a decision to create a startup company to flying his private jet to pick up a detained news reporter. What astonishes me despite all his success is that “Amazon founder Jeff Bezos went from the son of a teen mom to the world's richest person, his wealth topping $105 billion”(Catherine Clifford-cnbc article title). He is living proof that extraordinary things can happen no matter the life you’re born into.  Whether you’re born into a poor childhood or a wealthy one, there is a chance. A chance to do good. Bezos had a dream and he executed, leaving a huge imprint in the 21st century. Through his determination to change the world and his unconditional desire to help others, he will forever serve as a hero. As an inspiration for future generations, Jeff Bezos has and will keep innovating, continuing to demonstrate his many of his heroic attributes and changing the lives of many along the way.Works CitedAu-Yeung, Angel. “Bezos, Son of Cuban Immigrant Gives $33 Million to Non Profit HelpingDreamers Pay for College.” Forbes, Forbes Magazine, 12 Jan. 2018, 1:41pm.“Jeff Bezos Biography.” Biography.com, A&E Television Networks, 31 Jan. 2018,Hartmans, Avery. “The Fabulous Life of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, the Second-Richest Person inthe World.” Businessinsider.com, 15 May 2017, 4:04pm,Clifford, Catherine. “How Amazon's Jeff Bezos Went from Son of a Teen Mom to Building a$105 Billion Fortune.” CNBC, CNBC, 9 Jan. 2018, 1:15pm,"Jeff Bezos."

      Bezos (pronounced bay-zohs), founder, chief executive office (CEO), and
      head cheerleader forAmazon.com, the Internet bookselling company he founded in 1995. With about $1
      million in capital, most borrowed from friends and family, Bezos built a
      multibillion-dollar empire in about five years and in doing so,
      revolutionized the way commerce is done on the Internet.Childhood YearsJeffrey Preston Bezos was born January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New
      Mexico. A year later, his parents divorced and since then he has never had
      contact with his biological father. Three years later, his mother, Jackie
      Gise, married Michael Bezos, who fled his native Cuba when he was fifteen
      years old."In early 1996 we were called Amazon.con, in '97
        Amazon.toast, and in 1999 it was Amazon.bomb. Then there was my personal
        favorite:Amazon.org, because clearly we're not for profit.… It still gets a
        ton of attention. I mean, you're still talking to me."Much of Jeff Bezos's relentless drive and ambition likely came from
      his new father, who was raised in a Catholic mission. Mike Bezos always
      strove to better himself, learning English 
       and working various odd jobs to pay for his education at the University
      of New Mexico at Albuquerque. After college, he became an engineer with
      Exxon Corporation, causing the family to move to Texas. After several
      years, another job transfer brought them to Florida, where Jeff Bezos
      attended Palmetto High School in Miami. Bezos was popular in school and
      became class president and valedictorian in his senior year.Early InnovatorBezos always had a knack for figuring out how things work. InJeff Bezos: King of Amazon,author Josepha Sherman writes, "From the time he was a toddler,
      Bezos was busy trying to change his world. He felt he was too old to sleep
      in a 'baby' crib, so he found a screwdriver and took the
      crib apart. Instead of getting mad, Bezos's family encouraged
      him."Bezos had a younger sister, Christina, and brother, Mark. When the young
      siblings learned to walk, they loved going into their brother's
      room because of all the fascinating "toys". To warn him that
      the children were coming, Jeff attached an alarm to his bedroom door that
      made a loud buzzing sound when someone entered.When Bezos was twelve he wanted something called an Infinity Cube. The
      device was a set of small motorized mirrors that reflected off one another
      so the images seemed to go on endlessly. It cost $20 but Bezos did not
      have enough money to buy it. Instead, he purchased mirrors and other parts
      with what money he had and constructed his own reflecting cube. He built
      other inventions, including amateur robots. At one point he had so much
      clutter in his bedroom, his parents made him move all of his half-finished
      devices and experiments into the garage.There are many similar stories surrounding Bezos's childhood years.
      He spent countless hours building models and an assortment of electronics
      kits. He worked on science projects, often coming up with his own
      "inventions." By the time he reached high school, he had
      turned the family garage into his personal science and electronics
      laboratory. Ironically, Bezos later would launchAmazon.comfrom his own garage.Enters PrincetonAfter graduating with honors from high school, Bezos decided to follow in
      the footsteps of Stephen Hawking and enroll in the physics program at
      Princeton University. He soon realized, however, that the subject was too
      difficult for him, so he switched to a double major in electronics and
      computer science. Bezos discovered he excelled at creating software
      programs. In 1986, he graduated with highest honors and Phi Beta Kappa
      (membership in a national honor society), earning degrees in electrical
      engineering and the still new field of computer science.Bezos turned down several job offers from large corporations and instead
      took a position with a newly formed fiber optic company, Fitel. His task
      was to help the company build a computer network specifically for
      international finance. In 1988, he took a job developing systems for
      managing investment funds at Banker's Trust in New York City. After
      two years, he moved to the Wall Street investment firm of D. E. Shaw
      & Company as a computer specialist. In 1992, at age twenty-eight,
      he became Shaw's youngest ever vice president; two years later he
      was promoted to senior vice president.Bezos and DisneyAt various times, Jeff Bezos dreamed of becoming a cowboy or an
        astronaut. He was a devotedStar Trekfan and went as far as naming his dog Kamala after a minor character
        from an episode ofStar Trek: The Next Generation.His heroesincluded American inventor Thomas Edison(1847-1931), astrophysicist Stephen Hawking (1942-), andWalt Disney(see entry), although he was no Mickey Mouse fan. Instead, he was
        fascinated with how Disney came up with the electronics and animatronics
        used in Disney World in Orlando, Florida."The thing that always amazed me [about Disney] was how powerful
        his vision was," Bezos said in aTimearticle. "He knew exactly what he wanted to build and teamed up
        with a bunch of really smart people and built it. Everyone thought it
        wouldn't work, and he had to persuade the banks to lend him $400
        million. But he did it." Many friendsandfamily members would likely say the same thing about Bezos and the way
        he tookAmazon.comfrom an idea to a multibillion-dollar enterprise. Bezos, however, did
        it much quicker than Disney.From Idea to RealityWhile at Shaw Bezos developed the idea that would eventually becomeAmazon.com. In 1994, he read an article about how the World Wide Web was growing by
      2,300 percent a year. He knew he had to tap into such a great potential
      for commerce but was unsure what type of business would work 
       best. He researched mail-order companies, believing their products would
      sell well on the Internet. After drawing up a list of twenty popular
      mail-order items, Bezos finally settled on books since the millions of
      titles in print offered an enormous potential for sales.On July 6,1995, Bezos launchedAmazon.com, named after the South American river, with financial and moral support
      from family and friends. The company operated out of the garage of the
      Bezos's two-bedroom home in suburban Seattle, Washington. With
      almost no publicity, sales took off immediately. "Within the first
      few days, I knew this was going to be huge," Bezos toldTime."It was obvious that we were onto something much bigger than we
      ever dared to hope."Person of the YearBy the end of 1999,Amazon.comhad become a multibillion-dollar corporation offering 3.5 million titles
      for sale. It had expanded into a variety of other merchandise, including
      music and videos, and had set up operations in Europe. Bezos's
      personal fortune alone was estimated at $10.5 billion. In the crowning
      achievement of his career,Timemagazine named Bezos its "Person of the Year" for 1999,
      proclaiming him king of cybercommerce.With success came adversity. The company became involved in several
      notable lawsuits filed by Barnes & Noble and Wal-Mart. But none of
      the problems compared to the biggest challenge of all: making the company
      profitable.Amazon.comlost money every year, including $1.4 billion in 2000. In 2001, the
      company laid off thirteen hundred workers and instituted other
      cost-cutting measures. The belt-tightening worked andAmazon.composted its first ever net profit of $5.1 million for the fourth quarter
      of 2001.Despite his hectic schedule, the head of the world's largest
        bookstore still finds time to read. Jeff Bezos buys about ten books a
        month although he reads only three. His favorites includeThe Remains of the Dayby Kazuo Ishiguro,Duneby Frank Herbert, andBuilt to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companiesby James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras.For the future, Bezos plans to makeAmazon.coma place people can buy anything they want on-line. And now that theCEO and founder Jeff Bezos is known for his sunny disposition and
            booming laugh.Reproduced by permission of the Corbis Corporation (Bellevue).company is firmly rooted, Bezos and his wife MacKenzie want to turn their
      attention to charitable work. "At some point, we want to figure out
      how to do philanthropic work that's highly leveraged," said
      Bezos. "It's very easy to give away money ineffectively. But

He was born the son of a 16-year-old mom and deadbeat dad. And he didn't set out to be the CEO of an e-commerce juggernaut.Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff BezosPhoto by Bloomberg"I won the lottery with my mom. Thanks for literally everything, Mom"Jeff Bezos was born on January 12, 1964, as Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen. His biological dad, Ted Jorgensen, met and started dating his mother, Jacklyn Gise, when they were both in high school. Jorgensen was 18 and Gise was 16 when she became pregnant. They flew to Mexico with their parents' money to get married.Jorgensen belonged to a unicycle troupe and worked at a retail store making $1.25 an hour, so he didn't have much money. He was also "had a habit of drinking too much," according to"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon," by journalist and biographer Brad Stone. When Jeff Bezos was 17 months old, his mom divorced Jorgensen.In 1968, Gise remarried Miguel Bezos, who arrived in Miami in 1962 from Cuba knowing only one word of English: "hamburger." Jorgensen agreed to let Bezos adopt his son and, at 4 years old, Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen became Jeffrey Preston Bezos.Biographer Stone suggests that Bezos' childhood may have contributed to his obsession with success. "It is of course unknowable whether the unusual circumstances of his birth helped to create that fecund entrepreneurial mix of intelligence, ambition, and a relentless need to prove himself. Two other technology icons, Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison, were adopted, and the experience is thought by some to have given each a powerful motivation to succeed," Stone writes.Growing up, Bezos spent summers with his grandparents on their Texas ranch,he says in the commencement speechhe gave at Princeton in 2010. "I helped fix windmills, vaccinate cattle, and do other chores. We also watched soap operas every afternoon, especially 'Days of our Lives,'" says Bezos.Bezos would also occasionally get to road trip with his grandparents."My grandparents belonged to a Caravan Club, a group of Airstream trailer owners who travel together around the U.S. and Canada. And every few summers, we'd join the caravan,"Bezos says in graduation speech. "We'd hitch up the Airstream trailer to my grandfather's car, and off we'd go, in a line with 300 other Airstream adventurers. I loved and worshipped my grandparents and I really looked forward to these trips."Launching Amazon: "I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice"Bezos got straight As in high school, was the valedictorian of his class and was accepted early admission to Princeton, according to Stone's biography. For a time in college,he thought he would be a theoretical physicist.But it was years later, while working in finance in New York City that he had the idea to start Amazon."I came across the fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year. I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles — something that simply couldn't exist in the physical world — was very exciting to me," says Bezos, in his 2010 Princeton address.At the time, Bezos was just 30 and had been married for a year. "I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go do this crazy thing that probably wouldn't work since most startups don't, and I wasn't sure what would happen after that," he says.After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.Jeff Bezosfounder of Amazon, Blue OriginHis wife told him to go for it."As a young boy,I'd been a garage inventor. I'd invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker that didn't work very well out of an umbrella and tinfoil, baking-pan alarms to entrap my siblings," he says. "I'd always wanted to be an inventor, and she wanted me to follow my passion."But not everyone was on board. Bezos boss took a walk through Central Park and told Bezos that, while it sounded like a "really good idea," it would be an even better idea for somebody who didn't already have a good career."That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision,"says Bezos. "Seen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing. And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all."After much consideration,I took the less safe pathto follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice."The early days of Amazon: "I thought maybe one day we would be able to afford a forklift"When Amazon first started, it sold only books. Bezos would drive the packages to the post office himselfin his 1987 Chevy Blazer. "I thought maybe one day we would be able to afford a forklift,"Bezos tells Charlie Rosein a wide-ranging interview in 2016. "And it is very, it's very, very different today."After books, the next items Bezos added to Amazon were music and videos. Then, he asked customers to see what else they would want to buy from the online retailer."I sent an email message out to the customer base, actually a thousand randomly selected customers, and I said, besides books, music and video, what would you like to see us sell? And the list came back incredibly long," explains Bezos."It was basically just whatever the person had on their mind right now," says Bezos, and that sparked an idea.VIDEO1:0501:05Here's what makes up the Jeff Bezos empireThe Definitive Guide to Business"One of customers said, 'I wish you sold windshield wipers because I need windshield wipers for my car.' A light kind of went on in my head. You know, people — people will want to use this new fangled e-commerce way of shopping for everything,"Bezos says to Rose."People are very convenience-motivated," says Bezos. "So that really started the kind of the expansion into all categories, consumer electronics, and then apparel, and so on."Expand he did. Today, Amazon sells almost everything. From toilet paperto groceriesto electronics to fashion to furniture.When Bezos enters a new product category, he is not intimidated by a lack of expertise."I am never disappointed when we're not good at something because I think, well think how good it's going to work when we are good at it,"Bezos tells Rose. "And the apparel is like that. There is so much opportunity. Nobody really knows how to do a great job of offering — apparel online yet. And we have tons of invention and ideas and working our way through that experimental list."Amazon's North star: "Customer obsession, as opposed to competitor obsession"Bezos has always been a rare combination of optimistic, idealistic and visionary.Back in 2003, while much of the tech industry was still hungover from the dot-com bust, Bezos was aggressively foretelling the potential of the Internet. "I do think there's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us,"says Bezos in a TED Talkhe gave that year. "We're very, very early."As Bezos charged full force into the Wild West that was the Internet then, he was — and still is today — guided by a single belief: Do what is best for the customer."Thing that connects everything that Amazon does is the number one — our number one conviction and idea and philosophy and principle which is customer obsession, as opposed to competitor obsession. And so we are always focused on the customer, working backwards from the customer's needs, developing new skills internally so that we can satisfy what we perceive to be future customer needs,"Bezos tells Rose.Another through line to Bezos' business strategy is his "willingness to think long-term," he says."We are very happy to invest in new initiatives that are very risky, for five to seven years, which most companies won't do that,"Bezos tells Rose. "It's the combination of the risk-taking and the long-term outlook that make Amazon, not unique, but special in a smaller crowd."Finally, he's obsessive about finding problems and fixing them."Taking real pride in operational excellence, so just doing things well, finding defects and working backwards — that is all the incremental improvement that in business, most successful companies are very good at this one. ... [Y]ou don't want to ever let defects flow downstream,"Bezos says to Rose. "That is a key part of doing a good job in any business in my opinion."VIDEO0:5100:51The evolution of Jeff Bezos: See if you can recognize him through the yearsDigital OriginalFrom e-commerce to mediaAs consumer behavior on the web has evolved, so, too has Amazon. Prime, the e-commerce's populartwo-day shipping membershipcomes with access to premium television shows, for example.Being a content creator built on the back of an e-commerce giant gives Amazon freedom to be creative. For example, one of Amazon's most popular shows, "Transparent," is about a patriarch who becomes a woman later in life. It's won eight Emmys and beennominated for another 28."A show like 'Transparent' which has won Golden Globes and Emmys is not ever — it is not a show that could be successfully done on broadcast TV, because broadcast TV needs a much bigger audience,"says Bezos to Rose. "And so you can actually think about the creative process a little differently. You can attract different storytellers. You can go for stories that are narrower but incredibly powerful and well told."In addition to producing online shows, Bezos is also the owner of another kind of content: journalism. Through his Nash Holdings LLC, hebought the Washington Postin 2013 for $250 million."I bought it because it's important," says Bezos. "I would never buy a financially upside down salty snack food company. You know, that doesn't make any sense to me. But The Washington Post is important. And so it makes sense to me to take something like that, and I also am optimistic. And I thought there were some ways to make it — I want it to be a self-sustaining, profitable enterprise," Bezos says to Rose. "And I think it can be done."Bezos' empire now stretches far and wide. Amazon, which currently has amarket cap of more than $500 billion,bought Whole Foods in Augustand also owns companies like Zappos and Twitch. ThroughBezos Expeditions, he's also invested in companies like Twitter and Basecamp,among many others.The final frontier: "I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5"While shipping toiletries and downloading books hasmade Bezos wealthy, his passion is outer space.Buzz Aldrin dropped by Blue Origin HQ to say hi to the team yesterday."This is a childhood dream,"Bezos says to Rose. "I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5 years old. I watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon. You don't choose your passions, your passions choose you. So I am infected with this idea. I couldn't ever stop thinking about space. I have been thinking about it ever since then."To that end, Bezos is the founder ofBlue Origin, a company that aims tomake space tourism affordable."Basically what I am doing right now is taking my Amazon winnings and investing them. Every time you see me sell stock on Amazon, it's send more money to the Blue Origin team,"Bezos says to Rose.In addition to making it possible for more people to travel to space, Bezos says he is building the infrastructure for the next generation of space entrepreneurs."[I]f I'm 80 years old, looking back on my life and the one thing I have done is make it so that there is this gigantic entrepreneurial explosion in space for the next generation," says Bezos, "I will be a happy, happy man."See also:How Jeff Bezos, now the richest person in the world, spends his billions12 books that shaped the way Jeff Bezos, now the world's richest man, thinks about successJeff Bezos is now the richest man in the world—and he could also become the first trillionaireVIDEO0:5200:52Jeff Bezos now the world's richest man based on stock wealthSquawk BoxLike this story?

Jeff Bezos: Life Story, Bio and FactsELEVATESOCIETYAboutElevating KnowledgeElevating GoalsElevating BooksElevating IdeasJeff Bezos: Life Story, Bio and FactsEarly Life, Struggles, and Road to SuccessThe impact of a single stroke of genius can be immeasurable.Take the case of Jeff Bezos, the founder ofAmazon.com, who started an online bookstore in his garage and forever changed the way we buy just about everything.LEARN MOREBezos is a true pioneer who sees opportunities on the horizon and takes risks to get ahead of the trends.Early Interests and InitiativeJeffrey Preston Bezos was born to a ranch family in Albuquerque, New Mexico on January 12, 1964. Jeff’s mother, who was a teenager when he was born, only remained with his father for about a year, then remarried Miguel Bezos, a Cuban immigrant who had come to the U.S. by himself when he was 15, working his way through the university to become an engineer for Exxon.Jeff Bezos showed a precocious interest in engineering himself, tinkering with things around the house, even turning his parents’ garage into a sort of laboratory. He pursued his passion for science and technology while in high school, attending the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. He also started his first business in high school: the Dream Institute, a summer enrichment camp for grade-schoolers.After turning briefly to physics in his undergraduate studies, Bezos committed to his love for computers and went on to earn his degree from Princeton in electrical engineering and computer science.After college, he took a job on Wall Street that allowed him to still be involved in the field of computer science. He quickly established a high-paying career for himself in finance.But once again, his lifelong curiosity would draw him back into the world of technology. He left his lucrative job and went headlong in pursuit of his inspired start-up vision: he saw the opening for e-commerce in the rapid development of the Internet, along with recent changes in tax regulation, and he came up with an idea to take advantage of these profitable conditions.He didn’t waste any time, either. Bezos wrote the business plan for the online bookstore we now know as Amazon while making the cross-country trip from New York to Seattle, where he would start his new company in his garage.Amazon and BeyondWith only a few employees, Bezos started developing software in his own home. After having his friends beta test the site, he launched Amazon.com on July 16, 1995.It was an instant success. In the first few weeks of its existence, with no promotional budget, Amazon grossed $20,000 in international book sales, a faster growth than Bezos himself had imagined.When Amazon went public in 1997, Bezos faced doubts about whether the company could compete with established retailers once they too went online. But Amazon had changed the game and continued to lead.What set Amazon apart from other companies during the dot.com bust was its versatility: Bezos repeated his model for book sales with CDs and videos, then with apparel, electronics, and other items, turning Amazon into a one-stop shop by partnering with more and more retailers.In 2011, Amazon saw a 70% growth and was valued at over $17 billion.The net worth of Jeff Bezos is estimated in the billions as well, but he’s not simply accumulating wealth. Instead of paying himself the typical CEO-sized salary, he invests in the next big innovation.In 2006, he announced that he had founded a human spaceflight startup, Blue Origin, with plans to make space exploration widely available. He is also venturing into what he calls the “uncharted terrain” of online journalism with his purchase in 2013 of the Washington Post. Again, Bezos is taking the lead by taking the risks that will adapt the marketplace.Success in New Ideas, Not NumbersIn 2014, Jeff Bezos ranked 17th on the list of wealthiest people in the world. But this statistic is not the right measure for his success.If Bezos were driven to be successful by making money, Amazon would probably not exist, at least not as we know it today, because he might not have risked his wealthy lifestyle for the chance to start something new, from the ground up—and not just a new business, but a new way of doing business.If personal wealth was what Bezos was after, he could simply let Amazon run its course and collect the profits, instead of investing in new possibilities, reinvigorating the news and space industries through adaptive innovation.Bezos recognizes possibilities within emerging conditions and takes action for the sake of these possibilities. Although his story is filled with impressive numbers, its theme is putting new ideas into practice.* Photo bySteve Jurvetson***Who is Jeff Bezos? - Short BioJeff Bezos is an American businessman, investor, and philanthropist.

He was high schoolvaledictorian, aNational Merit Scholar,[34][35]and aSilver Knight Awardwinner in 1982.[34]In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind wouldcolonize space.

E. Shaw and founded Amazon in a rented garage inBellevue, Washington on July 5, 1994, after writing itsbusiness planon a cross-country drive from New York City toSeattle.[46][47]With Bezos at the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company's first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially.[48]Prior to settling on Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at anIndian reservationnearSan Franciscoin order to avoid paying taxes.[49]Bezos initially named his new companyCadabrabut later changed the name toAmazonafter theAmazon Riverin South America, in part because the name begins with the letterA, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[50]At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with "A" would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches.[51]In addition, he regarded "Amazon," the name of the world's largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world's largest online bookstore.[51]He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents as investment in Amazon.[47][52][53]He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[54]Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[44][50]Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with aninitial public offering(IPO).[55]In response to critical reports fromFortuneandBarron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such asBordersandBarnes & Noble.[50]In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company's products to include a variety of otherconsumer goods.[50]Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company's 1997equity offeringto finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[50]In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350 million.[56]In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launchAmazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels andwebsite traffic.[50]In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[57]After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[56]In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400 million.[58][failed verification]In November 2007, Bezos launched theAmazon Kindle.[59]According to a 2008Timeprofile, Bezos wished to create a device that allowed a "flow state" in reading similar to the experience of video games.[60]In 2013, Bezos secured a $600-million contract with theCentral Intelligence Agency(CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[61]In October of that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[62]Bezos in 2010In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[63]On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7 million.[64]A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[65]By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109 billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular,Blue Origin.[66]On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon'sSuper Bowl commercial.[67]On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterlyearningsof $2 billion.[68]Due to the growth ofAlibabain China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon intoIndia.[69]On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became theworld's wealthiest personoverMicrosoftco-founderBill Gateswhen his estimatednet worthincreased to just over $90 billion.

If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America."[81]Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary "misleading" as it included part-time workers.[82]However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[83]On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[84]The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour, a decision that was interpreted as support for theFight for $15movement.[85]In February 2021, Bezos announced that in thethird quarterof 2021 he would step down from his role as CEO of Amazon to become the Executive Chairman of the Amazon Board. He was succeeded as CEO byAndy Jassy.[86][87][88]On February 2, 2021, Bezos sent an email[89]to all Amazon employees, telling them the transition would give him "the time and energy [he] need[s] to focus on theDay 1 Fund, theBezos Earth Fund,Blue Origin,The Washington Post, and [his] other passions."[90]Blue OriginMain article:Blue OriginBezos andRob Meyerson(fifth from left) giving NASA Deputy AdministratorLori Garver(fourth from left) a tour of Blue Origin's crew capsule in 2011U.S. Secretary of DefenseAsh Cartermeets with Bezos in 2016 atThe Pentagon.In September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, ahuman spaceflightstartup.[91]Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel and the development of human life in the Solar System.[35]His 1982 high schoolvaledictoriansenior graduation speech was followed up with aMiami Heraldinterview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for human beings who were in orbit.[92]The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse throughresource depletion.[93]Rob Meyersonled Blue Origin from 2003 to 2017 and served as its first president.[94]After its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006 when it purchased a large tract of land inWest Texasfor a launch and test facility.[95]After the company gained the public's attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing thecost of space travelfor humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[96]In September 2011, one of the company's uncrewed prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight.

Bezos was a multi-billionaire who drove a 1996Honda Accord.[139]Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[140][141][142]Bezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[143][144]This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman, who described him as "talking in lists" and "[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made."[140]Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrotea bookthat described Bezos as a demanding boss as well ashyper-competitive,[136][143]and opined that Bezos perhaps "bet the biggest on the Internet" than anyone else.[145]Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles andexternalities.[146][147]During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift.

Shawand again during the early years of Amazon. He described thislife philosophyby stating: "When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes."[162]During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.[38]To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed themantra"Get Big Fast", establishing the company's need toscaleits operations to produce market dominance.[50]He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form ofdividends.[140]Bezos uses the term "work–life harmony" instead of the more standard "work–life balance" because he believes thatbalanceimplies that you can only have one and not the other. He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other.[163]JournalistWalt Mossbergdubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique shouldn't do anything new or interesting "The Bezos Principle".[164]Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule—a preference that meetings are small enough for twopizzasto feed everyone in the boardroom.[165]When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon, he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise thecommon standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.[166]In 2018, it was reported that he met with Amazon investors for just six hours a year.[165]Instead of usingpresentation slides, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives.[167]Since 1998, Bezos has published an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers, not competitors; take risks formarket leadership; facilitate staff morale; build acompany culture; and empower people.[168][169]Bezos maintains the email address jeff@amazon.com[170]as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company. Although he does not respond to the emails, he forwards some of them with a question mark in the subject line to executives who attempt to address the issues.[171]Bezos has citedJeff ImmeltofNew Enterprise Associates,[172]Warren BuffettofBerkshire Hathaway,Jamie DimonofJPMorgan Chase, andBob IgerofThe Walt Disney Companyas major influences on his leadership style.[172][173]RecognitionIn 1999, Bezos received his first major award whenTimenamed himPerson of the Year.[174]In 2008, he was selected byU.S. News & World Reportas one of America's best leaders.[175]Bezos was awarded an honorary doctorate in science and technology fromCarnegie Mellon Universityin 2008.[176]In 2011,The Economistgave Bezos and Gregg Zehr an Innovation Award for theAmazon Kindle.[177]In 2012, Bezos was named Businessperson of the Year byFortune.[178]He is also a member of theBilderberg Groupand attended the 2011 Bilderberg conference inSt. Moritz, Switzerland,[179]and the2013 conferenceinWatford, Hertfordshire, England.

Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and dissident was employed as a writer at theWashington Post, owned by Bezos. Khashoggi was killed in late 2018, in Turkey's Saudi consulate for his critical stance and journalism against the Saudi government and its leader.[284]In January 2020,The Guardianreported that the hack was initiated before the murder but after Khashoggi wrote critically about the crown prince in theWashington Post. Forensic analysis of Bezos's mobile phone conducted by advisory firmFTI Consulting, concluded it "highly probable" that the hack was achieved using a malicious file hidden in a video sent in aWhatsAppmessage to Bezos from the personal account of the crown prince on May 1, 2018.[285][286]Saudi Arabia has denied the claim.[287]PhilanthropyBezos funded the retrieval of theseF-1 engineparts from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean in 2015, eventually donating them to theSeattle Museum of Flight.

However, in July 2018, the net worth of Bezos officially surpassed the $150 billion mark, which led most major wealth indexes to label him the wealthiest person in modern history (post-1982).[221]References^Jonge, Peter de (March 14, 1999)."Riding the Wild, Perilous Waters of Amazone.com".The New York Times.ISSN0362-4331.

Trump, the source said, is eyeing legal means to take down Amazon. Axios wrote that Trump believes the company is harming smaller companies and wants to curtail its dominance on online shopping.Trump wants to do so by considering a change in Amazon's tax status or utilizing antitrust law against the company.In the week that's followed that Axios report, Trump hasn't been shy about blasting the company on Twitter and in public.On Tuesday alone, Trumptweetedthat he was "right" about his criticism of Amazon's deal with the US Postal Service,later telling reportersin the White House that Amazon is causing massive store closuresBut this is nothing new, as the president has been waging war againstthe internet giant for more than a year.In December, he tweeted that the e-commerce giant was unfairly reaping the benefits of that USPS deal, something that Axios reported Wednesday was still very much on Trump's mind. Trump said the deal was enriching Amazon while making the USPS "dumber and poorer.""Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer?"Trump tweeted. "Should be charging MUCH MORE!"In August, he accused the company of doing "great damage to tax paying retailers," adding that "towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt — many jobs being lost!"And beginning in December 2016, Trump took hit after hit at The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon's founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, tying the publication to Amazon.He accusedThe Post ofpossibly beinga "lobbyist weapon" for the company, seeking to keep politicians "from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly." He called the publication a "big tax shelter" for Amazon, the stock of which he said would "crumble like a paper bag" if the company "ever had to pay fair taxes."And he attempted to brandthe paper as the "#AmazonWashingtonPost."Though Trump and Bezos have been part of a few meetings together, the Amazon CEO has raised eyebrows by appearing to wear his emotions on his sleeve. His expressions don'tsuggest any sortof chemistry between the two leaders.—Ryan McGee  (@TVMcGee)June 20, 2017Amazon does have a lot working in its favoras it faces headwinds from Trump. An August poll from theleft-leaning Public Policy Pollingfound that 53% of Trump voters held a favorable view of Amazon, while just 20% held an unfavorable view of the company. Another 27% said they were not sure.Among all respondents, 60% held favorable views of Amazon, while 13% viewed the company unfavorably and 26% were unsure.And a recent Reuters poll found that 60% of online shoppers planned to use Amazon for most of their holiday purchases, a 10-point increase in just two years.Their main competitors, Walmart, Target, and Macy's, all saw a decline in the percentage of shoppers who used their online services.Asked by Business Insider last year about the administration's thoughts on Amazon and some of the other tech giants possibly becoming too large, a White House official said in a statement that the internet tech industry was "one of the crown jewels in the American economy." But "nonetheless," they said, "the stability of the rule of law equally to all is also a critical component to economic prosperity.""Violations of the law will be enforced," the official said.This post has been updated.Sign up for notifications from Insider!

The$23 million mansionowned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is a 15-minute drive to the northwest. The Washington Post, owned by Bezos, is a short walk to the northeast. Amazon’s Washington headquarters is just to the east.Head a bit farther south across the Potomac River into Virginia and there’s Crystal City, soon to be renamed “National Landing” once Amazon makes it home to its massive second headquarters, or HQ2, investment.Even beyond that, the outskirts of the city — a northern Virginia area thathas been described as“the bull’s-eye of America’s internet” — is home to 29 of the company’s 35 Amazon Web Services data centers. On a map, it can look like a pending invasion of the nation’s capital.But Amazon is already deeply embedded in Washington and has plans to further entrench itself in the nation’s capital, putting it close to power brokers as well as billions of dollars in government contracts. While major tech companies have ingrained themselves in the capital in recent years, none are as present as Amazon, according to policy and lobbying experts who spoke to NBC News.Many companies have cozied up to Washington, but none have accrued the kind of presence and reach that Amazon will soon boast. And with good reason. Amazon’s government interests expand well beyond lobbying. It is now facing growing calls to be broken up by the federal government while also bidding for billions of dollars worth of government contracts."I think they see there is a lot of profit to be made in government contracts and want to be part of that," said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor. "Maybe some of the Amazon executives in the area will end up going to the same country club as antitrust or tax policymakers and end up offering jobs or internships to bureaucrats or political appointees' kids, or engage in similar soft corruption.""There are a lot of opportunities for influence once you get your own people insinuated into the elite clubs, schools, and other social venues in D.C."Prime real estateAmazon's Washington operation is headlined by the upcoming arrival of HQ2, which the company opted to place in the area after what amounted to a nationwide competition.Amazon initially announced a separate second headquarters in New York City, but withdrew amid political pressure over subsidies the state had offered to lure the company. As a result of HQ2,Amazon has pledgedto deliver 25,000 new jobs in the Virginia area over the next decade.David Fontana, a George Washington University law professor, said the company was making fairly standard moves early on — building up a lobbying presence and hiring Washington insiders "to do D.C. work."But with HQ2, the company is bringing the business side of their operation in as well. As he put it, "there's nothing like" the influx of private sector jobs Amazon is planning in the nation’s capital in the city's history."That's a big line to cross," Fontana said.An Amazon spokesperson said the company decided to locate "in Virginia" because of the state’s "business-friendly environment" and its belief that it will be able to attract "world-class talent" to the area."Its proximity to D.C. did not influence our HQ2 decision," the spokesperson said.'A little scary'When it comes to lobbying, Amazon lobbied more government entities than any tech company last year,Bloomberg reported. So far in 2019, it's spent more on lobbying than any tech company, at more than $8.1 million, after spending a record $14.4 million in 2018, according toThe Center for Responsive Politics.AsBloombergnoted, Amazon has increased its lobbying spending by more than 460 percent since 2012 while the company's roster of in-house lobbyists has nearly tripled since 2015. The companyhas lobbied the governmenton an array of issues, like taxes, trade, immigration and defense.While Amazon's lobbying efforts are expansive and growing, they are comparable to companies like Facebook, Northrop Grumman and AT&T. And though Amazon's expansion into the Washington market will outpace other private sector employers, defense contractors and other large businesses have populated the land between the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers for some time, viewing the nation’s capital as essential to their core business."Amazon provides a wide range of products and services for our customers, and we’re always looking for ways to innovate on their behalf," an Amazon spokesperson told NBC News. "Our Washington, D.C., team is focused on ensuring we are advocating on issues that are important to our customers, our employees and policymakers."But Amazon isn’t quite comparable to other companies, according to Terry Schilling, executive director of the American Principles Project, a conservative think tank."I don't think I've ever seen a corporation, like a single corporation, have this type of impact and influence on public policy from a federal all the way down to a state and local level," Schilling said. "And it's very impressive and a little scary."For Amazon, what's at stakeWhat does Amazon care about? For starters, getting government agencies to use its cloud computing services and buy supplies from its site, observers say.The company dove headfirst into the government contracting competition, most prominently seeking a cloud computingcontract with the Pentagonworth up to $10 billion, after having locked down a similar, slightly less-lucrative contract with the CIA earlier in the decade.But that contract has also shown that some politicians are growing wary of Amazon's power. Last month, Defense Secretary Mark Esper launched a review of the bidding process after Amazon's competitors like IBM and Oracle complained that the terms for the contract were unfairly designed to benefit Amazon, a claim that a federal judge and the Government Accountability Office ruled against. That also came after the White Housedemandedsuch a review — something that leading Republicans on Capitol Hill like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., have pushed for as well.Rubio wrote Esper multiple times on the subject and, as one senior Senate aide told NBC News, has been aggressively lobbying fellow senators to further scrutinize the contract. A Rubio spokesperson told NBC News that the senator spoke to Trump and national security adviser John Bolton about the contract, and his staff has worked with the Defense Department on the issue prior to its announcement of a review. Of note, billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison donated millions to Rubio's presidential campaign.Amazon employees protest on Prime DayJuly 15, 201903:00An Amazon spokesperson called the claims of unfairness "meritless and a desperate attempt to distort the facts," pointing to the federal court ruling.That battle might pale in comparison to other headwinds the company may face depending on the results of the next presidential election. While Trump has repeatedly taken aim at the company because of Bezos' ownership of The Post, other 2020 contenders like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,who has also been critical of The Post/Bezos nexus, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have discussed breaking up the company. Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justiceare currently investigatingAmazon for possible antitrust violations.And, should a Democrat win the White House in 2020, there's likely to be increased scrutiny over the rules that allow Amazon to avoidpaying federal income taxes."Look, when you are the biggest retailer on the planet, there's going to be some overlap on the government stuff, and it also puts this huge bull's-eye on you," said one Washington insider who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he counts Blue Origin, Bezos' space exploration company, among his clients. "Walmart's probably sitting back saying, 'Oh thank, God," because, it used to be everybody trashed Walmart."While Amazon is often grouped in with fellow tech giants like Facebook and Google in terms of the scrutiny it receives, Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that has long urged much tougher regulation of the big tech companies, said Amazon is in a unique position to influence Washington."Now you have the richest man in the country running one of the biggest companies in the country, owning The Washington Post and bringing massive numbers of employees to D.C.," Stoller said. "That's really breaking down a wall that has existed since the founding of the country, which is that we keep our business centers and our political centers separate."Allan SmithAllan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News.AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCA NoticeTerms of ServiceNBC News SitemapAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance© 2023 NBC UNIVERSALNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday Logo
This Is What Really Happens When Amazon Comes to Your Town - POLITICO MagazineSkip to Main ContentPOLITICO MagazineMenuOur LatestEmail Signuppolitico.comFacebookTwitterElaine Thompson/AP PhotoLETTER FROM SEATTLEThis Is What Really Happens When Amazon Comes to Your TownTrust me, I saw my city transform—and not always for the better.By PAUL ROBERTSOctober 19, 2017Continue to article contentFacebookTwitterCommentPrintContinue to article contentSeattle journalist Paul Roberts writes about technology, business and politics. His latest book isThe Impulse Society: America in the Age of Instant Gratification. Follow him@pauledrobertsSEATTLE—Thursday is the deadline for cities bidding to host “HQ2,” as Amazon calls its planned second headquarters, and the competition has been intense. More than a hundred would-be hosts have assembled generous packages with everything from multibillion-dollar tax breaks to free utilities to anofferto build Amazon its own city (also named Amazon) in the hope of enticing the online retail giant and up to 50,000 of its handsomely paid employees.But as these cities go all-out to win Amazon’s affections, they might take a lesson from the city where those same affections have dimmed: Seattle. To be sure, the town’s business community is mortified to be losing so much of Amazon’s future growth to another city and has roundly blamed the city’s left-leaning “anti-business” politics. But many ordinary Seattleites seem relieved. Most would acknowledge the extraordinary prosperity that Amazon has brought to Seattle since Jeff Bezos and his startup arrived in 1994. But they are also keenly aware of the costs, not least the nation’s fastest-rising housing prices, appalling traffic and a painful erosion of urban identity. What was once a quirkily mellow, solidly middle-class city now feels like a stressed-out, two-tier town with a thin layer of wealthy young techies atop a base of anxious wage workers. As one City Council member put it, HQ2 may give Seattle “a little breathing room” to cope with a decade of raging, Amazon-fueled growth. A commenter on a local news site was less diplomatic: “Amazon = cancer.”None of which will deter Amazon’s suitors. In their view, any downsides from HQ2 will pale against the upsides—the six-figure salaries and the $5 billion campus, of course, but more than that, the legendary Amazon power to transform a city, as it has Seattle, into a “knowledge capital.”Yet as anyone who has witnessed that Seattle transformation firsthand could tell you, Amazon’s suitors may be laboring under some fairly unrealistic expectations. Certainly, they are underestimating the impact that tens of thousands of young, well-paid “knowledge” workers can have on local infrastructure, housing prices and even politics. But they’re probably also overstating the benefits of being Amazon’s second company town. That’s because they don’t fully appreciate how much of Seattle’s Amazon miracle was due, not to Bezos or Amazon or even the knowledge economy, but to Seattle’s own very particular mix of economic, cultural and environmental ingredients. These homegrown upsides might not be so easy to replicate.***When outsiders gaze covetouslyat Seattle’s Amazon boom, what they’re really seeing isn’t the effect of a single company, but of a chain reaction. Amazon is now so central to the global knowledge economy that it exerts its own economic gravitational force on the tech industry. The company’s dominance in cloud computing, for example, means that other cloud players feel pressure to be in Seattle. This clustering of firms around Amazon has created a talent vortex, which has drawn more tech workers to Seattle. And that enlarged talent pool has in turn attracted still more tech firms, which have drawn still more workers to the city, and so on.This self-feeding dynamic, known as “agglomeration,” has been a huge force in Seattle. In the past seven years alone—the period of Amazon’s most explosive growth—more than 20 Fortune 500 companies have opened engineering or R&D campuses here—including Facebook, Google and Apple, tech’s three other giants, plus newcomers like Uber. The city has gained 53,000 jobs (on top of the roughly 40,000 at the Amazon headquarters), some $17 billion in new wages, salaries, and other compensation, and $38 billion in new investment, according to Amazon’s own analysis. (Indeed, even since the HQ2 announcement, Amazon has locked up an additional 1.2 million square feet of office space in downtown Seattle.) Little wonder that other cities believe HQ2 will be “a transformational event,” as one consultant put it. Or that the Seattle Chamber of Commerce would reprimand its own citizens for not recognizing that “Amazon is the best thing that has happened to the city in the modern era.”But cities hoping for their own transformational event should keep several caveats in mind. Most obviously, Amazon isn’t the only reason Seattle has been attracting all the firms, talent and capital. The area’s “other” tech icon, Microsoft, headquartered since 1986 in nearby Redmond, is still spinning out its own considerable agglomerative powers. It boasts the world’s second-largest cloud operation, a huge workforce and a famously productive web of spinoffs and startups, many of which now exert their own Seattle gravitational pull. The Seattle-based travel company Expedia, to take one example, is a Microsoft spinoff, whose creator (and eventual CEO), Richard Barton, went on to launch Seattle-based real estate website Zillow. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, a prodigious startup launcher in his own right, also developed the vast business park downtown that became Amazon’s campus. Other gravitational centers abound. AT&T Cellular and Nintendo are here. The very tech-focused University of Washington has launched scores of ventures and technology transfers. And for all the talk of the “new” economy, one of Seattle’s biggest tech firms is also one of its oldest—aerospace giant Boeing, which has been attracting engineers and computer scientists, and launching spinoffs, for decades.In other words, long before Amazon was even a business plan, Seattle had developed what urban geographer Heike Mayer calls the “entrepreneurial ecology”—a potent mix of talent, institutional expertise and networks that startups like Microsoft and later Amazon were able to plug into. And that ecology still provides a critical advantage to newcomers—one that could hardly be expected to transfer neatly to another city simply because Amazon builds a headquarters there.Prospective host cities will point to their own nascent tech sectors, prestigious universities and other local sources of tech talent: Amazon would hardly be starting from scratch. But a closer look at Seattle makes clear that this city’s powerful entrepreneurial ecology wasn’t driven only by its tech sector. Seattle’s deservedly outsized reputation for inventiveness runs the full business spectrum. The city is a long-time leader in medical, bioscience and genetics research. It is the epicenter for some of the biggest retail innovations of the modern era, including Starbucks, Nordstrom, REI and Eddie Bauer. (Costco is based just outside the city.) Even the city’s art and indie music scene is enormously enterprising: SubPop Records almost single-handedly launched grunge music. By the time Bezos arrived, Seattle boasted a proven culture of innovating, executing and branding that would have been fertile ground for a company trying to reinvent retailing—and that is still giving a unique boost to the city’s tech sector.Other cities will have skilled workforces and universities, says Andy Yan, director of The City Program at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, and a longtime observer of Seattle’s economy. But what they can’t duplicate is Seattle’s weird mix of history, culture and business, “The same culture that came up with Amazon also came up with grunge,” Yan says. “I mean, how much of Amazon is actually the ‘child’ of Nordstrom and Nirvana?” And how much of that “alchemy,” as Yan calls it, will transfer to another town?Yan’s alchemy underscores another important, and hard to duplicate, factor in Seattle’s Amazon moment: This city is a bizarrely powerful people magnet. Decades before urban theorist Richard Florida advised cities to recruit the “Creative Class” with parks, nightlife and other amenities, Seattle was not only pulling in a disproportionate share of creative newcomers, but also was retaining them, even when times got tough. Case in point: During the brutal “Boeing bust” of the early 1970s, a national recession and the collapse of the aerospace sector cost Seattle more than 100,000 jobs and bumped unemployment to 17 percent—the worst for any U.S. urban area since the Great Depression. Yet the city held onto most of its talented workers and even continued to bring in new ones, according to a1973 Rand studyMore impressive still, Rand found, half of these well-educated newcomers arrived without secure employment: The city’s “attractions were such that workers came looking for jobs even during times of monumental unemployment rates.”Seattle’s high labor “stickiness,” as economists call it, is hardly surprising. Beyond its gorgeous setting, charming single-family neighborhoods and hip culture, Seattle’s atmosphere of entrepreneurship and the ever-present possibility of rags-to-stock-options riches has been a powerful attractant in its own right, says Jacob Vigdor, an economist and urban policy expert at the University of Washington. Even for the out-of-work, says Vigdor, “there’s this inclination to think, ‘Hey, this is a town where new stuff is happening, where there’ll be some startup or some other sort of opportunity for me.’”This urban brand has been a critical piece of Seattle’s tech success. During tech booms, it has helped tech firms poach talent from bigger, better-paying places like Silicon Valley; but during the busts, it has also helped Seattle hold onto skilled workers who are laid off, thus preserving a talent pool that helps the tech sector bounce back sooner. But, like the rest of the city’s entrepreneurial ecology, that stick-around-factor will be no easier for other cities to import.Winning HQ2 may be “a great way to get an ‘anchor tenant’ around which you can build,” says Ed Lazowska, a top University of Washington computer scientist who has watched Seattle’s tech scene develop since the 1970s. “But the notion that Amazon is going to be your ticket to a glorious future, absent all the other things that a place like Seattle has to offer—that’s delusional.” Put another way, it may be that Seattle was actually the best thing that happened to Amazon.***To be sure, much of the hype over HQ2is just that—hype. Most would-be host cities surely know they can’t expect a full repeat of Seattle’s Amazon miracle. But they do expect, quite reasonably, that the sheer scale of the second headquarters—the $5 billion spent on a campus, and the 50,000 jobs, with an average salary of close to $100,000—will create ripple effects that, while not as big as Seattle’s, would still be quite large.The question, of course, is whether those benefits would outweigh the costs. These include the billions of dollars in tax breaks and other explicit giveaways. But they also include the broader impacts that Seattleites have seen in the past few years as Amazon and its rivals have boomed. The influx of well-paid tech workers has helped drive up the median house price by 69 percent since 2012, and has added to income inequality: The average tech salary was $98,215 last year, while more than half of the city’s residents earned less than $50,000. And rich and poor alike must endure traffic congestion that is now the fourth worst in the United States. Such “negative externalities,” as economists call them, aren’t the fault of Amazon or any of its tech peers. Even pre-Bezos, Seattle’s housing market and transportation infrastructure had struggled under the city’s superstar status. Seattle’s new Amazon headache is simply what happens when a hyper-successful company meets an already popular city.But that is precisely the point. Were Jeff Bezos to build HQ2 in a less popular city—Detroit, say, or St. Louis—where housing and infrastructure aren’t already under such pressure, the negative externalities truly would pale against the benefits.Yet it’s hard to see that happening. Although company officials have extolled the virtues of geographic diversity—one executive says a non-Pacific Northwest headquarters would let Amazon “recruit a different collection of employees”—Bezos has made clear he wants a city similar to Seattle—which is to say, a city that is already a magnet for the kind of person Amazon wants to hire. Such a city, says the University of Washington’s Vigdor, is almost certainly already in the red zone for things like affordability, which would only be intensified by “bringing in 40,000 highly paid employees to compete for the same relatively constant supply of housing.”READ MOREPoliticsWhy Trump Will Regret Passing Tax ReformByMatt LatimerFourth EstateTrump’s Fake Jihad Against the Fake NewsByJack ShaferPoliticsThe Urge to PurgeByBill ScherPolitical ScienceTrump’s Obsessed With His IQ.

Calls Trump Comments ‘Shocking’ByEdward-Isaac DovereTrue, these externalities would be countered, at least in part, by HQ2’s massive benefits—such as more tax revenue for city services and schools. The problem, says Vigdor, is that neither the benefits or the costs will be evenly distributed. Although residents may well benefit from things like more school funding in the long run, he says, most won’t be getting any of those six-figure salaries. “But what theyaregoing to find is that the price of many of the things that they have to buy is going to trend upward.” And if Seattle’s experience is any guide, Vigdor says, “it’s not just the poor who are getting squeezed out. It’s the firefighters and school teachers and a lot of other traditional middle-class occupations where a $600,000-dollar house does not look affordable.”Such a situation, as Seattle has also discovered, is not a recipe for civic tranquility. In recent years, hostility toward Amazon and its employees has grown palpable. That is one of the factors, according to Seattle business leaders, that helped drive Amazon’s HQ2 decision. Where a more appreciative town would have been proud of its corporate citizen, Seattle went the opposite direction. There were constant anti-Amazon harangues in the media and, worse, a series of less-than-business-friendly policies, among them, a $15 an hour minimum wage, strict limits on how companies can schedule employees, and thepièce de résistance, a citywide 2.25-percent income tax on individual incomes above $250,000 and jointly filed incomes above $500,000 that, as one opponent put it, “clearly targets higher wage earners at companies like Amazon.” (A subtext in the city is that both Bezos and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer have opposed previous efforts at a statewide income tax.)But the complaints that Seattle has turned anti-business miss the point. Seattle has indeed tilted decidedly and often absurdly to the left in recent years. (Socialist Seattle City Council member Kshama Sawant once proposed nationalizing Boeing.) But even a more conservative Seattle couldn’t have come close to absorbing the 40,000 additional workers Amazon is going to hire for HQ2. More fundamentally—and more relevant for would-be host cities—these “anti-business” complaints ignore the way Amazon and other tech firms themselves have helped foster Seattle’s disloyalty. Even residents here who are thankful for Amazon’s presence recognize how the company’s rapid growth has added to affordability and inequality problems—and as a result have been more willing to support worker-friendly policies, such as the $15 minimum wage.But tech firms have played another, more paradoxical role in the city’s growing skepticism for its tech elites. The young, educated army of knowledge workers who have flocked to Seattle since the 1990s have also helped alter Seattle’s political chemistry. Many are highly supportive of progressive causes, says Seattle pollster Ben Anderstone, and have tended to vote for Seattle’s ever more left-leaning politicians.And it’s these politicians who are enacting the policies that so irk local business—including some of the same businesses that recruited these youthful voters in the first place. As Anderstone observes, there is often “a significant gulf in attitude toward politics, if not ideology, between tech company workers and tech company management.”This political paradox may be the ultimate example of both the costs and the benefits that come with Amazon. No doubt, most cities bidding for HQ2 believe themselves capable of handling the housing costs and the traffic. But they may be less prepared for the fact that they would also be importing a culture. Whether these cities realize it or not, Anderstone says, the decision to bid for HQ2 is a decision not merely about their economic future, but “about their identity as well: what kind of political culture they want to have and what kind of people they want to bring to shape it.”Share on FacebookShare on TwitterCLARIFICATION:An earlier version of this article suggested that former Microsoftie Richard Barton founded online travel company Expedia after he left Microsoft.

Or to be one of its competitors or potential acquisitions? Or even to be related to founder Jeff Bezos? Look no further than this lengthy piece by Brad Stone, whose book on Bezos and his companycomes out in later this month(natch, that’s an Amazon link). On my first question, Bezos isn’t a particularly nice boss. Amazon’s culture is “notoriously confrontational,” with Bezos regularly embarking on what employees call “nutters,” which largely consist of him shooting off phrases like “Are you lazy or incompetent?” “I’m sorry, did I take my stupid pills today?” and “If I hear that idea again, I’m gonna have to kill myself.” And yet many people who work there thrive in this environment and generally find that Bezos is right on target when he flippantly dismisses an idea or prioritizes a customer complaint over being civil to his underlings.And unlike many top companies that offer employees flexible working arrangements and other perks, Amazon gives new employees “a backpack with a power adapter, a laptop dock, and orientation materials,” and reimburses only part of their public-transit passes. This is a huge jump from the 1990s, however, when “Bezos refused to give employees city bus passes because he didn’t want to give them any reason to rush out of the office to catch the last bus of the day.”As for my second and third questions, you’re going to have to read the article. In particular, what happens when Stone tracks down Bezos’s biological father is astonishing.Barbarians at the GateMaking the Leap Into Developed MarketsLondon Business SchoolHow will established companies in the U.S., Europe, and Japan respond when companies from emerging markets invade developed economies with “good-enough” substitutes for what the incumbents have been successfully selling in the homeland? It’s going to happen sooner or later. Tata Motors, for example, is expected to launch a full-scale attack on American markets with its ultra-cheap cars. When the assault comes, companies can take a lesson from Gillette, which dealt with a similar threat from Bic’s cheap disposable razors in the 1990s. By introducing disposable-razor innovations such as lubrication strips, Gillette seized the initiative and essentially redefined the market, writes Costas Markides. Gillette “managed to convince consumers that they should expect more from their razors and that Bic was not really ‘good enough’ for them.” This kind of nimble response from tough, wily corporations in the developed world will likely limit the invaders’ success in wresting market share from the incumbents, Markides says.—Andy O’ConnellHabitsWhy You Can't Stop Checking Your PhoneBoston GlobeForming habits is one of the ways we become more productive. Essentially, our brains create shortcuts when it comes to things we do often, like turning off the lights, thereby saving our mental bandwidth for times when we need to make an important decision. This is all well and good, explains Leon Neyfakh, except when it comes to checking your phone while you drive.With distracted driving, which injured 387,000 people and killed 3,331 more in 2011, the impulse has been to increase public awareness (filmmaker Werner Herzogdirected this 30-minute stunnerof a campaign, for example). But that approach may not work. Your phone programs your brain to habitually check it. And when checking text messages or Twitter becomes a neurological shortcut, we may not even be aware we’re picking up our phones, particularly because the act of driving preoccupies our prefrontal cortex, which controls inhibition. So how do we make ourselves, and others, safer? Some suggest social campaigns to make checking phones in certain situations socially taboo. Or we can fight habit with habit, teaching our brains that there are times when we should turn our phones off.Rashomon in Silicon ValleyAll Is Fair in Love and TwitterNew York Times MagazineHope you like start-up soap operas. In this downright juicy excerpt from Nick Bilton’s forthcoming bookHatching Twitter, we finally get to the bottom of the social network’s origin story. And it ain’t what developer and self-proclaimed Twitter inventor Jack Dorsey has peddled all these years (among other things, he supposedly invented Twitter on a playground, or when he was 8 years old, or because he was fascinated with trains and maps).There are far, far too many wonderful details to squeeze in here (like the time Ev Williams told Dorsey, “You can either be a dressmaker or the CEO of Twitter,” but not both, or when Dorsey insisted that employees use Twitter rather than text messages, which resulted in a six-figure monthly bill). But the most resonant aspect of the piece is that after Dorsey was essentially forced out as CEO, he spun his own origin story, portraying himself as the heart and soul of Twitter in order to maneuver his way back to the top of a company he once struggled to run. In the end, Bilton reminds us that the creation of Twitter was truly a collaborative effort. Some people are making a ton of money because of it. Others, like Noah Glass (heard of him?), the man who actually came up with the name “Twitter,” aren’t.Self-Absorbed with an Open Wallet?The Millennial Male Is Not Who You Think He IsAdweekTraditionally, American men between the ages of 18 and 34 have been a lucrative target for marketers. But, says Sam Theilman at Adweek, the recession and lingering underemployment have made the millennial generation a very different breed of youth from their counterparts of old. Collectively, millennials carry an eye-popping $1 trillion in student loans, even though only a quarter of the males among them managed to get a degree. Just 62% of millennial men have jobs; half of those work less than full time. And they’re not being paid much for their efforts. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the gap between productivity and real hourly compensation has never been wider, which means they’re doing a lot more work for a lot less money.The upshot: Millennials are poor, which is making them very frugal consumers. New cars are beyond them, and even cable is too expensive. More than a third still live with their parents. Unless the economy starts generating better-paying jobs, they’re unlikely ever to turn into the kind of consumers the Baby Boomers and Gen Xers were at their age.—Andrea OvansBONUS BITSWhen Things Go BadlyWhy It’s So Hard for Companies to Make Digital Transformations(Sloan Management Review)Blackberry, Disruption, and Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda(Learning by Shipping)The U.S. Debt Ceiling Crisis Explained(The Guardian)Gretchen Gavettis an associate editor at the Harvard Business Review.

This Is What Really Happens When Amazon Comes to Your Town - POLITICO MagazineSkip to Main ContentPOLITICO MagazineMenuOur LatestEmail Signuppolitico.comFacebookTwitterElaine Thompson/AP PhotoLETTER FROM SEATTLEThis Is What Really Happens When Amazon Comes to Your TownTrust me, I saw my city transform—and not always for the better.By PAUL ROBERTSOctober 19, 2017Continue to article contentFacebookTwitterCommentPrintContinue to article contentSeattle journalist Paul Roberts writes about technology, business and politics. His latest book isThe Impulse Society: America in the Age of Instant Gratification. Follow him@pauledrobertsSEATTLE—Thursday is the deadline for cities bidding to host “HQ2,” as Amazon calls its planned second headquarters, and the competition has been intense. More than a hundred would-be hosts have assembled generous packages with everything from multibillion-dollar tax breaks to free utilities to anofferto build Amazon its own city (also named Amazon) in the hope of enticing the online retail giant and up to 50,000 of its handsomely paid employees.But as these cities go all-out to win Amazon’s affections, they might take a lesson from the city where those same affections have dimmed: Seattle. To be sure, the town’s business community is mortified to be losing so much of Amazon’s future growth to another city and has roundly blamed the city’s left-leaning “anti-business” politics. But many ordinary Seattleites seem relieved. Most would acknowledge the extraordinary prosperity that Amazon has brought to Seattle since Jeff Bezos and his startup arrived in 1994. But they are also keenly aware of the costs, not least the nation’s fastest-rising housing prices, appalling traffic and a painful erosion of urban identity. What was once a quirkily mellow, solidly middle-class city now feels like a stressed-out, two-tier town with a thin layer of wealthy young techies atop a base of anxious wage workers. As one City Council member put it, HQ2 may give Seattle “a little breathing room” to cope with a decade of raging, Amazon-fueled growth. A commenter on a local news site was less diplomatic: “Amazon = cancer.”None of which will deter Amazon’s suitors. In their view, any downsides from HQ2 will pale against the upsides—the six-figure salaries and the $5 billion campus, of course, but more than that, the legendary Amazon power to transform a city, as it has Seattle, into a “knowledge capital.”Yet as anyone who has witnessed that Seattle transformation firsthand could tell you, Amazon’s suitors may be laboring under some fairly unrealistic expectations. Certainly, they are underestimating the impact that tens of thousands of young, well-paid “knowledge” workers can have on local infrastructure, housing prices and even politics. But they’re probably also overstating the benefits of being Amazon’s second company town. That’s because they don’t fully appreciate how much of Seattle’s Amazon miracle was due, not to Bezos or Amazon or even the knowledge economy, but to Seattle’s own very particular mix of economic, cultural and environmental ingredients. These homegrown upsides might not be so easy to replicate.***When outsiders gaze covetouslyat Seattle’s Amazon boom, what they’re really seeing isn’t the effect of a single company, but of a chain reaction. Amazon is now so central to the global knowledge economy that it exerts its own economic gravitational force on the tech industry. The company’s dominance in cloud computing, for example, means that other cloud players feel pressure to be in Seattle. This clustering of firms around Amazon has created a talent vortex, which has drawn more tech workers to Seattle. And that enlarged talent pool has in turn attracted still more tech firms, which have drawn still more workers to the city, and so on.This self-feeding dynamic, known as “agglomeration,” has been a huge force in Seattle. In the past seven years alone—the period of Amazon’s most explosive growth—more than 20 Fortune 500 companies have opened engineering or R&D campuses here—including Facebook, Google and Apple, tech’s three other giants, plus newcomers like Uber. The city has gained 53,000 jobs (on top of the roughly 40,000 at the Amazon headquarters), some $17 billion in new wages, salaries, and other compensation, and $38 billion in new investment, according to Amazon’s own analysis. (Indeed, even since the HQ2 announcement, Amazon has locked up an additional 1.2 million square feet of office space in downtown Seattle.) Little wonder that other cities believe HQ2 will be “a transformational event,” as one consultant put it. Or that the Seattle Chamber of Commerce would reprimand its own citizens for not recognizing that “Amazon is the best thing that has happened to the city in the modern era.”But cities hoping for their own transformational event should keep several caveats in mind. Most obviously, Amazon isn’t the only reason Seattle has been attracting all the firms, talent and capital. The area’s “other” tech icon, Microsoft, headquartered since 1986 in nearby Redmond, is still spinning out its own considerable agglomerative powers. It boasts the world’s second-largest cloud operation, a huge workforce and a famously productive web of spinoffs and startups, many of which now exert their own Seattle gravitational pull. The Seattle-based travel company Expedia, to take one example, is a Microsoft spinoff, whose creator (and eventual CEO), Richard Barton, went on to launch Seattle-based real estate website Zillow. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, a prodigious startup launcher in his own right, also developed the vast business park downtown that became Amazon’s campus. Other gravitational centers abound. AT&T Cellular and Nintendo are here. The very tech-focused University of Washington has launched scores of ventures and technology transfers. And for all the talk of the “new” economy, one of Seattle’s biggest tech firms is also one of its oldest—aerospace giant Boeing, which has been attracting engineers and computer scientists, and launching spinoffs, for decades.In other words, long before Amazon was even a business plan, Seattle had developed what urban geographer Heike Mayer calls the “entrepreneurial ecology”—a potent mix of talent, institutional expertise and networks that startups like Microsoft and later Amazon were able to plug into. And that ecology still provides a critical advantage to newcomers—one that could hardly be expected to transfer neatly to another city simply because Amazon builds a headquarters there.Prospective host cities will point to their own nascent tech sectors, prestigious universities and other local sources of tech talent: Amazon would hardly be starting from scratch. But a closer look at Seattle makes clear that this city’s powerful entrepreneurial ecology wasn’t driven only by its tech sector. Seattle’s deservedly outsized reputation for inventiveness runs the full business spectrum. The city is a long-time leader in medical, bioscience and genetics research. It is the epicenter for some of the biggest retail innovations of the modern era, including Starbucks, Nordstrom, REI and Eddie Bauer. (Costco is based just outside the city.) Even the city’s art and indie music scene is enormously enterprising: SubPop Records almost single-handedly launched grunge music. By the time Bezos arrived, Seattle boasted a proven culture of innovating, executing and branding that would have been fertile ground for a company trying to reinvent retailing—and that is still giving a unique boost to the city’s tech sector.Other cities will have skilled workforces and universities, says Andy Yan, director of The City Program at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, and a longtime observer of Seattle’s economy. But what they can’t duplicate is Seattle’s weird mix of history, culture and business, “The same culture that came up with Amazon also came up with grunge,” Yan says. “I mean, how much of Amazon is actually the ‘child’ of Nordstrom and Nirvana?” And how much of that “alchemy,” as Yan calls it, will transfer to another town?Yan’s alchemy underscores another important, and hard to duplicate, factor in Seattle’s Amazon moment: This city is a bizarrely powerful people magnet. Decades before urban theorist Richard Florida advised cities to recruit the “Creative Class” with parks, nightlife and other amenities, Seattle was not only pulling in a disproportionate share of creative newcomers, but also was retaining them, even when times got tough. Case in point: During the brutal “Boeing bust” of the early 1970s, a national recession and the collapse of the aerospace sector cost Seattle more than 100,000 jobs and bumped unemployment to 17 percent—the worst for any U.S. urban area since the Great Depression. Yet the city held onto most of its talented workers and even continued to bring in new ones, according to a1973 Rand studyMore impressive still, Rand found, half of these well-educated newcomers arrived without secure employment: The city’s “attractions were such that workers came looking for jobs even during times of monumental unemployment rates.”Seattle’s high labor “stickiness,” as economists call it, is hardly surprising. Beyond its gorgeous setting, charming single-family neighborhoods and hip culture, Seattle’s atmosphere of entrepreneurship and the ever-present possibility of rags-to-stock-options riches has been a powerful attractant in its own right, says Jacob Vigdor, an economist and urban policy expert at the University of Washington. Even for the out-of-work, says Vigdor, “there’s this inclination to think, ‘Hey, this is a town where new stuff is happening, where there’ll be some startup or some other sort of opportunity for me.’”This urban brand has been a critical piece of Seattle’s tech success. During tech booms, it has helped tech firms poach talent from bigger, better-paying places like Silicon Valley; but during the busts, it has also helped Seattle hold onto skilled workers who are laid off, thus preserving a talent pool that helps the tech sector bounce back sooner. But, like the rest of the city’s entrepreneurial ecology, that stick-around-factor will be no easier for other cities to import.Winning HQ2 may be “a great way to get an ‘anchor tenant’ around which you can build,” says Ed Lazowska, a top University of Washington computer scientist who has watched Seattle’s tech scene develop since the 1970s. “But the notion that Amazon is going to be your ticket to a glorious future, absent all the other things that a place like Seattle has to offer—that’s delusional.” Put another way, it may be that Seattle was actually the best thing that happened to Amazon.***To be sure, much of the hype over HQ2is just that—hype. Most would-be host cities surely know they can’t expect a full repeat of Seattle’s Amazon miracle. But they do expect, quite reasonably, that the sheer scale of the second headquarters—the $5 billion spent on a campus, and the 50,000 jobs, with an average salary of close to $100,000—will create ripple effects that, while not as big as Seattle’s, would still be quite large.The question, of course, is whether those benefits would outweigh the costs. These include the billions of dollars in tax breaks and other explicit giveaways. But they also include the broader impacts that Seattleites have seen in the past few years as Amazon and its rivals have boomed. The influx of well-paid tech workers has helped drive up the median house price by 69 percent since 2012, and has added to income inequality: The average tech salary was $98,215 last year, while more than half of the city’s residents earned less than $50,000. And rich and poor alike must endure traffic congestion that is now the fourth worst in the United States. Such “negative externalities,” as economists call them, aren’t the fault of Amazon or any of its tech peers. Even pre-Bezos, Seattle’s housing market and transportation infrastructure had struggled under the city’s superstar status. Seattle’s new Amazon headache is simply what happens when a hyper-successful company meets an already popular city.But that is precisely the point. Were Jeff Bezos to build HQ2 in a less popular city—Detroit, say, or St. Louis—where housing and infrastructure aren’t already under such pressure, the negative externalities truly would pale against the benefits.Yet it’s hard to see that happening. Although company officials have extolled the virtues of geographic diversity—one executive says a non-Pacific Northwest headquarters would let Amazon “recruit a different collection of employees”—Bezos has made clear he wants a city similar to Seattle—which is to say, a city that is already a magnet for the kind of person Amazon wants to hire. Such a city, says the University of Washington’s Vigdor, is almost certainly already in the red zone for things like affordability, which would only be intensified by “bringing in 40,000 highly paid employees to compete for the same relatively constant supply of housing.”READ MOREPoliticsWhy Trump Will Regret Passing Tax ReformByMatt LatimerFourth EstateTrump’s Fake Jihad Against the Fake NewsByJack ShaferPoliticsThe Urge to PurgeByBill ScherPolitical ScienceTrump’s Obsessed With His IQ.

Gillette “managed to convince consumers that they should expect more from their razors and that Bic was not really ‘good enough’ for them.” This kind of nimble response from tough, wily corporations in the developed world will likely limit the invaders’ success in wresting market share from the incumbents, Markides says.—Andy O’ConnellHabitsWhy You Can't Stop Checking Your PhoneBoston GlobeForming habits is one of the ways we become more productive. Essentially, our brains create shortcuts when it comes to things we do often, like turning off the lights, thereby saving our mental bandwidth for times when we need to make an important decision. This is all well and good, explains Leon Neyfakh, except when it comes to checking your phone while you drive.With distracted driving, which injured 387,000 people and killed 3,331 more in 2011, the impulse has been to increase public awareness (filmmaker Werner Herzogdirected this 30-minute stunnerof a campaign, for example). But that approach may not work. Your phone programs your brain to habitually check it. And when checking text messages or Twitter becomes a neurological shortcut, we may not even be aware we’re picking up our phones, particularly because the act of driving preoccupies our prefrontal cortex, which controls inhibition. So how do we make ourselves, and others, safer? Some suggest social campaigns to make checking phones in certain situations socially taboo. Or we can fight habit with habit, teaching our brains that there are times when we should turn our phones off.Rashomon in Silicon ValleyAll Is Fair in Love and TwitterNew York Times MagazineHope you like start-up soap operas. In this downright juicy excerpt from Nick Bilton’s forthcoming bookHatching Twitter, we finally get to the bottom of the social network’s origin story. And it ain’t what developer and self-proclaimed Twitter inventor Jack Dorsey has peddled all these years (among other things, he supposedly invented Twitter on a playground, or when he was 8 years old, or because he was fascinated with trains and maps).There are far, far too many wonderful details to squeeze in here (like the time Ev Williams told Dorsey, “You can either be a dressmaker or the CEO of Twitter,” but not both, or when Dorsey insisted that employees use Twitter rather than text messages, which resulted in a six-figure monthly bill). But the most resonant aspect of the piece is that after Dorsey was essentially forced out as CEO, he spun his own origin story, portraying himself as the heart and soul of Twitter in order to maneuver his way back to the top of a company he once struggled to run. In the end, Bilton reminds us that the creation of Twitter was truly a collaborative effort. Some people are making a ton of money because of it. Others, like Noah Glass (heard of him?), the man who actually came up with the name “Twitter,” aren’t.Self-Absorbed with an Open Wallet?The Millennial Male Is Not Who You Think He IsAdweekTraditionally, American men between the ages of 18 and 34 have been a lucrative target for marketers. But, says Sam Theilman at Adweek, the recession and lingering underemployment have made the millennial generation a very different breed of youth from their counterparts of old. Collectively, millennials carry an eye-popping $1 trillion in student loans, even though only a quarter of the males among them managed to get a degree. Just 62% of millennial men have jobs; half of those work less than full time. And they’re not being paid much for their efforts. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the gap between productivity and real hourly compensation has never been wider, which means they’re doing a lot more work for a lot less money.The upshot: Millennials are poor, which is making them very frugal consumers. New cars are beyond them, and even cable is too expensive. More than a third still live with their parents. Unless the economy starts generating better-paying jobs, they’re unlikely ever to turn into the kind of consumers the Baby Boomers and Gen Xers were at their age.—Andrea OvansBONUS BITSWhen Things Go BadlyWhy It’s So Hard for Companies to Make Digital Transformations(Sloan Management Review)Blackberry, Disruption, and Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda(Learning by Shipping)The U.S. Debt Ceiling Crisis Explained(The Guardian)Gretchen Gavettis an associate editor at the Harvard Business Review.

In addition to running the e-commerce behemoth Amazon, he is also the founder of aerospace company, Blue Origin.He has been, by any measure, massively successful.But Bezos hasn't forgotten the people who helped him get there. In 2018, in a sweet video message, he took a moment to pay homage to his fourth grade teacher, Celestine Barnes, who inspired and supported him along his journey.Barnes taught Bezos at theRiver Oaks Elementary Schoolin Houston, Texas.Jeff Bezos, AmazonLindsey Wasson | ReutersBarnes' daughter, Jenise Raven, worked for weeks to get Bezos' attention ahead of her mother's 80th birthday in February 2018, according to areport from local Houston newsstation KHOU 11. Raven was hoping Bezos might send a card.Instead, Bezos said happy birthday via the video embedded above. Raven played the video at her mother's party on Saturday. KHOU 11 published a piece about the video Monday and Amazon provided the video toCNBC Make It.In the video, Bezos says:"Hi Mrs. Barnes, it's Jeff Bezos. You were one of my favorite teachers back in elementary school. I remember you from 4th grade very well. You may not recognize me, I had more hair back then, but I sure remember you. You had a big impact on me. I heard you were turning 80. That's a big milestone! Congratulations and happy birthday. I learned a lot at River Oaks. You were definitely one of my favorite teachers. Thank you for making 4th grade so special for me and for all the other kids too. I know you've been more than 30 years as a teacher and principal. You've had a big impact on people's lives. Great teachers do change lives. We were all incredibly lucky to have you. Happy birthday, Mrs. Barnes!""I need [my mom] to know that she's special, not only to me, but to all the people she touched throughout her journey," says Raven,speaking to KHOU 11 News. "I'm so appreciative and so grateful and so humbled by this whole experience."Barnes was surprised and happy."I was thrilled. I see a lot of my students in different roles, former students. Jeff is one who has been really outstanding, and I'm pleased to see him," says Barnes to KHOU 11. "This has been fabulous. I didn't know all this was going on. I'm amazed to no end. I'm truly thankful and grateful."Bezos remembered summers in Texas in hiscommencement speech at Princeton in 2010. He recounted learning a lesson from his grandfather, that it is harder to be "kind" than it is to be "clever.""Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy — they're given after all. Choices can be hard. You can seduce yourself with your gifts if you're not careful, and if you do, it'll probably be to the detriment of your choices," says Bezos in his graduation speech."When you are 80 years old, and in a quiet moment of reflection narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your life story, the telling that will be most compact and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made. In the end, we are our choices," says Bezos.This story was originally published on Feb. 7, 2018.

I remember him’,” said Raven.Barnes had a long career with HISD. She was one of the first black teachers at River Oaks Elementary. Her family says she continued to teach for over 30 years.Now, the educator is retired with her 80th birthday right around the corner.“I got the idea just as I went to bed last night to contact some of her old students. It just hit me, how amazing would it be if we could contact Mr. Bezos and have him write a birthday greeting for her? We would read it at her celebration on February 3,” her daughter said.Other former students have already sent notes. Some even plan to attend the party.However, a message from Bezos would be different.Even though Barnes suffers from dementia, she still clearly remembers the Amazon CEO after all these years.“I think she would be extremely, extremely elated. I can see her now,” said Raven. “She’s going through a change that is very hard for us to relate to. But we’re working through it. Sometimes we have to laugh to keep from crying, but I need her to know she’s special, not only to me but to all the people she touched throughout her journey.”Even though the Amazon CEO now has a seat at the table with some of the world's most powerful people, she hopes he still remembers sitting in Mrs. Barnes class more than 40 years ago.Before You Leave, Check This OutJobsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesEEO Public File ReportFCC Online Public Inspection FileClosed Caption ProceduresDo Not Sell My Personal Information© 2023 KING-TV.

He’s loved writing his entire life, from creating picture books when he was seven to learning how to write copy, scripts, audio stories for radio and more in college. The Hollywood Insider’s dedication to combining deft storytelling and positivity made him realize that this had to be his next step forward. Some of his hobbies include traveling, tv shows, and movies. His favorite show is Avatar: The Last Airbender. As of right now, he’s a charity fundraiser in Cincinnati.Feb 28, 2023Table of ContentsWith a Little Help from His ParentsJeff Bezos is ComplicatedWhat Makes Jeff More Than a SymbolAuthor‘Bezos: the Beginning’is a made-for-television movie now available for streaming onAmazon Primeand Google Play. It details the rise, trials, and tribulations ofBezos’early life in his attempt to start his now titanic e-commerce company. We witness Bezos (played byArmando Gutierez) start out as an endearing yet unconfident VP of a hedge fund company, then transition to creating an entirely online startup for purchasing books, then the polishing and repolishing of the idea ofAmazonuntil it bears some semblance of how we know it today.I was surprised that a biopic about his life hadn’t been made yet. To any given American citizen, Bezos is a wealth of mysteries and secrets. He represents our current economic system at its most extreme, and is as famous as any other famous tech giant (Bill Gates,Mark Zuckerberg,Jack Dorsey). Surely someone would have tried to make a film about him in the same vein as‘The Social Network’. Somehow, not until now. Overall, it’s a fairly watered-down interpretation of the controversial tech giant’s early life, sticking to the basic facts and not too much more. The book the movie is based on,‘Jeff Bezos-Zero to Hero’,  provides a fairly neutral if not more positive image of Bezos. We occasionally see him get into fights with his two other employees, and an increasingly fraught relationship with his (now ex) wifeMacKenzie Scott(played byAlex Mitchell). Still, there are things that an average person might not know about Jeff Bezos that were explored well in this story. Like the book, the movie tries to make room for moments that give a more complete and whole picture into who Jeff Bezos was and is as a person.Things to do:Subscribe toThe Hollywood Insider’sYouTube Channel, by clicking here.Limited Time Offer – FREE Subscription toThe Hollywood InsiderClick here to read more onThe Hollywood Insider’svision, values and mission statement here – Media has the responsibility to better our world –The Hollywood Insiderfully focuses on substance and meaningful entertainment, against gossip and scandal, by combining entertainment, education, and philanthropy.With a Little Help from His ParentsOne part of Bezos’ life that adds a lot to who he is that the movie touches on early in the story is the role his parents played in his life and career trajectory. After Jeff and MacKenzie decide to quit their jobs and begin their start-up, the first thing they do is ask around for loans. They drive toBezos’ parentshouse, and he asks them for an enormous loan, to which they ultimately agree to the next day. To say this is generous is an understatement. It’s an incredible opportunity that his parents give him at this moment, and it’s not baseless either. The movie notes that Bezos’ parents care deeply about their son, and would do almost anything to help their son succeed.This definitely adds an important layer to Bezos and his life story. For obvious reasons, the interaction plays a huge part in defining the entrepreneur: namely, his resourcefulness and his luck. He showed determination in taking the first step by trying to find money, which can be difficult for many reasons. The scene also becomes a commentary on the nature of what a person may or may not need when starting a business in our country. Three hundred thousand dollars is an enormous amount, but in terms of getting a business as ambitious as Jeff’s off the ground, it’s probably closer to what it would really take.Related video:EVOLUTION: Every Tom Cruise Role From 1981 to 2021, All Performances Exceptionally PoignantRelated video:EVOLUTION: Every Johnny Depp Role From 1984 to 2020, All Performances Exceptionally PoignantJeff Bezos is ComplicatedOne area this movie succeeded in when it did touch on it was the moodier side of Bezos. At times, the man comes across as mild-mannered, unwilling to step over other people to achieve his dreams. However, there are a few instances where a completely different aspect of him comes out. His relationship with MacKenzie starts out very supportive and without ego, but soon sours as complications pile up. While he’s kind to his employees’ faces most of the time, it’s also revealed that he’d purposely left out details of the plan he priorly discussed withShel Kaphanthat would’ve helped his career and finances.To be honest, the movie could have expanded a little more on this part of his life. Some of the most important moments would arguably be Bezos’ early decisions that negatively affected the people around him and their greater implications. His competitors, his employees, and his wife are occasionally mistreated. The darker side of Bezos is mainly relegated to the end of the movie, when he tells one of his smartest and hardest-working employees that he should’ve cared about his future more instead of giving the employee the kind of share he had asked for.Related article:MUST WATCH –The Hollywood Insider’sCEO Pritan Ambroase’s Love Letter to Black Lives Matter – VIDEORelated article:Why Queen Elizabeth II Is One Of The Greatest Monarchs | Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of United Queendom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland (Video Insight)Related article:All Best Actor/Actress Speeches From The Beginning Of Oscars 1929-2019 | Hollywood InsiderWhat Makes Jeff More Than a SymbolLast but not least, this movie also attempted to flesh out Bezos’ specific relationships with the people around him. For instance, one of the most important relationships he has is with his wife, MacKenzie Scott. MacKenzie worked at the same company he did at the beginning, and both are very ambitious people being spiritually crushed by their mindless hedge fund jobs. Bezos had a drive to do something more innovative, and MacKenzie was extremely creative with larger writing aspirations. Another defining relationship Bezos had is with his future competitor and founder of Barnes and Noble,Len Riggio. Riggio is incredibly skeptical and mocking Bezos’ idea, and this skepticism climaxes to anger when he threatens to sue Bezos over calling his e-commerce store the largest bookstore.The way the movie portrays how Bezos handles these interactions and their increasing hostility and disappointment is one of the most interesting parts of the story, and are defining moments that will shape the rest of his emotional life. At first, Bezos and his wife give each other grace when they make mistakes. This is true for his employees as well. Then, things take downturns when various obstacles come up: when funding is hard to come by, when no one else seems to like the idea, and so on. Once this stuff starts happening, Bezos struggles to balance the stress with handling his relationships with care. One helpful way to learn more about a person is how they treat others around them. How he handles this facet of life in all its complexity gives off a fairly nuanced understanding of Bezos’ strengths and weaknesses as an adult.‘Bezos: the Beginning’ has its moments that make it worth watching. It delivers on expanding on Bezos’ early personal life, and how it intermingled (for better and for worse) with his professional life. In doing so, the movie successfully paints Bezos as more than just a character worth studying. He becomes a real person, with real problems and strengths and neuroses like anyone else. ‘Bezos: the Beginning’ is out streaming on Amazon Prime, Google Play, Vudu, and as a YouTube rental.Director: Khoa LeaWriters: Allison Burnett, Tashena EbanksCast: Armando Gutierrez, Kevin Sorbo, Alex Mitchell, Sasha AndreevBy Zachary DePioreClick here to readThe Hollywood Insider’sCEO Pritan Ambroase’s love letter to Cinema, TV and Media. An excerpt from the love letter:The Hollywood Insider’sCEO/editor-in-chiefPritan Ambroaseaffirms,“We have the space and time for all your stories, no matter who/what/where you are. Media/Cinema/TV have a responsibility to better the world andThe Hollywood Insiderwill continue to do so.Talent, diversity and authenticity matter in Cinema/TV, media and storytelling. In fact, I reckon that we should announce “talent-diversity-authenticity-storytelling-Cinema-Oscars-Academy-Awards” as synonyms of each other. We show respect to talent and stories regardless of their skin color, race, gender, sexuality, religion, nationality, etc., thus allowing authenticity into this system just by something as simple as accepting and showing respect to the human species’ factual diversity. We become greater just by respecting and appreciating talent in all its shapes, sizes, and forms. Award winners, which includes nominees, must be chosen on the greatness of their talent ALONE.I am sure I am speaking for a multitude of Cinema lovers all over the world when I speak of the following sentiments that this medium of art has blessed me with. Cinema taught me about our world, at times in English and at times through the beautiful one-inch bar of subtitles. I learned from the stories in the global movies that we are all alike across all borders. Remember that one of the best symbols of many great civilizations and their prosperity has been the art they have left behind. This art can be in the form of paintings, sculptures, architecture, writings, inventions, etc. For our modern society, Cinema happens to be one of them. Cinema is more than just a form of entertainment, it is an integral part of society. I love the world uniting, be it for Cinema, TV, media, art, fashion, sport, etc. Please keep this going full speed.”More Interesting Stories FromTheHollywood Insider–Want GUARANTEED SUCCESS?

                                  as well as other partner offers and accept ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy.It's been a turbulent two-and-a-half years for Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez.In January 2019, the bombshell news broke that the Amazon CEO and his wife, MacKenzie, weregetting a divorceafter 25 years of marriage. Hours later, we learned that Bezos was in a relationship with Lauren Sanchez, a TV host and helicopter pilot who, along with her husband, had been friends with the Bezoses.Despite a tumultuous few months that involved leaked texts, blackmail, a billion-dollar divorce, and maybe even interference from the Saudi Arabian government, Bezos and Sanchez are still going strong.When Bezos embarked onhis high-profile trip to the edge of space, Sanchez was in attendance, greeting him with a hug when he landed back on Earth.Here's how their relationship became public and how they've spent the last two years as a couple.It all started on January 9, 2019. Shortly after 9 a.m., Jeff and his wife, MacKenzie, issued a joint statement on Twitter that they were divorcing.Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos.Dia Dipasupil / Staff"As our family and close friends know, after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends,"the statement read."If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again."MacKenzie is one of Amazon's earliest employees. The couple has four children together.Hours later, a second bombshell dropped: Bezos was in a relationship with Lauren Sanchez.Lauren Sanchez.Paul Archuleta/Getty ImagesSanchezstarted her career as a news reporter and anchor— she was a longtime anchor of "Good Day LA" on Fox 11 and worked as a correspondent on "Extra."More recently, she's worked as a helicopter pilot and founded her own aerial filming company in 2016 called Black Ops Aviation.Sanchez has also had TV and film roles, including as the host of the reality show "So You Think You Can Dance" and playing an anchor in movies like "Fight Club" and "The Day After Tomorrow," according toher IMDB page.Bezos and Sanchez met through her then-husband, Patrick Whitesell, the co-CEO of WME, a Hollywood talent agency.Jeff Bezos, right, with Lauren Sanchez and her then-husband, Patrick Whitesell.Todd Williamson/Getty Images for Amazon StudiosSanchez and Whitesell had been married since 2005, but at the time the news broke, the couple had been separated since that fall,according to Page Six.According to Brad Stone's book"Amazon Unbound,"Sanchez and Bezos reconnected at an Amazon Studios party for the film "Manchester by the Sea" in 2016, though it's unclear when their romance began.In March 2018, Sanchez was invited to Amazon's annual MARS conference in Palm Springs. One month later, they had dinner with Sanchez's brother, Michael, in Los Angeles.That July, Bezos hired Sanchez's company tofilm footagefor his rocket company, Blue Origin.The National Enquirer said it had conducted a four-month investigation into Bezos and Sanchez's relationship and had obtained texts and photos the couple had sent to each other.Jeff Bezos.AP Photo/Pablo Martinez MonsivaisThe Enquirer saidit had tracked the couple "across five states and 40,000 miles, tailed them in private jets, swanky limos, helicopter rides, romantic hikes, five-star hotel hideaways, intimate dinner dates and 'quality time' in hidden love nests."Page Six, which published the news a few hours before the Enquirer, reported that Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos knew that the Enquirer report was coming out and had timed their divorce announcement to get ahead of the news.The gossip site also reported at the time that Bezos and Sanchez started dating after Jeff and MacKenzie had separated the previous fall, and that MacKenzie knew of the relationship.The Enquirer said it had gotten its hands on "raunchy messages" and "erotic selfies," including a text that reportedly read: "I love you, alive girl."FILE PHOTO:  Founder, Chairman, CEO and President of Amazon Jeff Bezos speaks during an event about Blue Origin's space exploration plans in WashingtonREUTERS/Clodagh KilcoyneThe tabloid saidit also had racy photosof Bezos, including one that was too explicit to print.But according to Stone's book, the tabloid never actually had a "below-the-belt selfie" of Bezos — it was a photo of someone else Michael Sanchez took from a male escort website and showed to the tabloid over FaceTime.Almost immediately, questions arose about the Enquirer's motives for investigating Bezos and Sanchez and the tabloid's connection to President Trump.David Pecker, CEO of AMI.Marion Curtis via AP, FileA feud has simmered for years between Trump and Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, a frequent Trump target. The Enquirer's publisher, AMI, is run by David Pecker, a longtime Trump ally.By the end of January,The Daily Beast reportedthat Bezos was funding an investigation into who had leaked his private messages to the Enquirer. Bezos' personal head of security, Gavin de Becker,headed up the investigation. De Becker said at the time that he thought the leaks were "politically motivated," whichAMI denied.The investigation initially pointed to Michael Sanchez, Lauren's brother and an outspoken Trump supporter, as the person who leaked the photos and texts, whichSanchez denied.Then, in February, Bezos dropped a bombshell of his own: an explosive blog post titled "No thank you, Mr. Pecker," in which he accused Pecker and AMI of trying to blackmail him.Jeff Bezos.Reuters/Joshua RobertsBezos wrotethat the publisher had been threatening him with the publication of explicit photos he'd taken of himself unless he stopped investigating who was leaking his photos and texts to the tabloid.AMI also demanded that Bezos no longer claim the publisher's investigation into his personal life was influenced by political motivations, Bezos wrote.As a result, Bezos published the emails he'd received from AMI."Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten," Bezos wrote.Bezos also hinted in the post that there may have been a link between the investigation into his relationship with Sanchez and the Saudi Arabian government — specifically, that he might have been a target of the Saudis because he owns the Washington Post, which provided "unrelenting coverage," Bezos said, of the murder of its journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, who waskilled by Saudi agents. The "Saudi angle" of Bezos' own investigation into the leaks seemed to have "hit a particularly sensitive nerve" with Pecker, Bezos wrote.For its part,the Saudi Arabian government denied any rolein the situation and called the whole saga a "soap opera."Things quieted down for Bezos and Sanchez publicly for a few months, until April 2019, when Jeff and MacKenzie finalized the terms of their divorce.Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos at the 2017 Vanity Fair Oscar Party.Evan Agostini / AP ImagesJeff and MacKenzie Bezos bothreleased statements on Twittersaying they had "finished the process of dissolving" their marriage and would be co-parenting their four kids.MacKenzie said she was granting Jeff all her interests in the Washington Post and Blue Origin, as well as 75% of the Amazon stock they owned and voting control over the shares she retained.Her remaining stake in Amazon has positioned her among the richest people in the world witha net worth of $62.7 billion.One day later, Sanchez and Whitesell filed for divorce.Patrick Whitesell and Lauren Sanchez.AP PhotoTMZ reported at the timethat the couple asked for joint custody of their two children. The couple reportedlyfinalized their divorcein October 2019.The Bezos divorce was finalized in July. A few days later, Bezos and Sanchez made their first public appearance as a couple at Wimbledon.Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos.AP Photo/Tim IrelandThe couple wereseated behind the royalsat the men's Wimbledon final between Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic at the All England Club.A few months prior to Wimbledon, the couple had attended another exclusive event: the annual Allen & Company conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. There, they mingled with Warren Buffett, Tim Cook, and Mark Zuckerberg, according to Stone's book.The pair was spotted again in August on what appeared to be a fabulous European vacation: They were seen strolling through Saint-Tropez and cruising off the coast of Spain, in the Balearic Islands, aboard media mogul David Geffen's superyacht, the Rising Sun.The Rising Sun.Victor Fraile/ReutersOther guestsreportedly includedGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and the founder of Thrive Capital, Josh Kushner, along with his supermodel wife, Karlie Kloss.Bezos and Sanchez were then seen on fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg's sailing yacht off the coast of Italy. The couple appears to be close friends with von Furstenberg and her husband, IAC Chairman Barry Diller.Diane von Furstenberg and Jeff Bezos pose at the the opening of the Statue of Liberty Museum opening on May 15, 2019.Kevin Mazur/Getty ImagesSource:Page SixIn December, Bezos reportedly threw Sanchez an elaborate 50th birthday celebration that included both a private dinner and a star-studded party attended by von Furstenberg and Diller, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, and Timothée Chalamet.Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom.Phillip Faraone/Getty ImagesSource:Page SixAround the holidays, the couple jetted off to French-speaking Caribbean island St. Barths, relaxing on yachts and meandering around the island with Sanchez's son, Nikko Gonzalez.Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty ImagesSource:The CutIn January 2020, Sanchez accompanied Bezos on a trip to India.Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez in India on January 16, 2020.Prodip Guha/Getty ImagesSanchez attended Bezos' visit to Mahatma Gandhi's tomb andwalked the red carpet with Bezosat an Amazon Prime Video event in Mumbai.A few weeks later, Sanchez traveled with Bezos to another international event — this time,a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macronin Paris, France.In February 2020, Bezos became embroiled in a legal spat with Michael Sanchez, Lauren Sanchez's brother.John Sciulli/Getty Images; Mark Wilson/Getty Images; Samantha Lee/Business InsiderSanchezfiled a defamation lawsuit against Bezosin February, claiming Bezos and his security consultant, Gavin de Becker, falsely accused him of providing Bezos' nude photos to the National Enquirer. Sanchez claimed in the suit that Bezos told journalists he had handed over the images to the tabloid, but he says he never had the photos in his possession.Bezos saidin a court filing of his ownthat the suit amounted to "extortion" and directly threatened free speech. Bezos sought to dismiss Sanchez's lawsuit under a California law that's intended to protect against frivolous lawsuits.A judge has sincetossed Sanchez's defamation suit, citing a lack of evidence. The judge later ordered Sanchez to pay $218,000 in legal fees for Bezos.In the lawsuit, Sanchez used the word "fiancé" to describe Bezos' relationship to Lauren Sanchez, implying that the couple is engaged.Bezos and Sanchez outside the Taj Mahal in January.Pawan Sharma/AFP via Getty ImagesHere's the full sentencefrom the lawsuit(emphasis ours):"While Mr. de Becker's initial asserted theory was that Mr. Sanchez had sold out his sister for $200,000, Mr. de Becker soon realized this theory would not hold up because, among other reasons, it was inconceivable that Mr. Sanchez would ruin his relationship with his sister andher current fiancé, the richest man in the world,for financial gain."Bezos isn't described as Sanchez's fiancé anywhere else in the suit, and Bezos and Sanchez have never confirmed that they're engaged. In December,Page Six published photosof the couple on vacation, noting that Sanchez was wearing a large diamond ring on her right hand (engagement rings are worn on the left hand).At the time lawyers for Michael Sanchez said in a statement, "Michael's complaint speaks for itself." Representatives for Bezos and Sanchez did not respond to requests for comment.News broke in February 2020 that Bezos had reportedly purchased the Warner estate, a massive Beverly Hills compound, for $165 million. The purchase was the most expensive home sale in California history.The Warner estate in Beverly Hills.Los Angeles County/PictometryPrior to the sale,The New York Postreported that Bezos and Sanchez had been house-hunting in Los Angeles and touring mansions throughout the area for weeks.The Warner estatewas built by Hollywood mogul and Warner Bros. cofounder Jack Warner in 1937. It spans eight acres and is situated in the Benedict Canyon neighborhood of Beverly Hills. It's an incredibly private property that's surrounded by tall hedges, blocked off by a large gate, and completely hidden from view from the street.The compound is home to multiple dwellings, including two guesthouses and a 13,600-square-foot mansion. The estate also features a pool, tennis court, and manicured gardens, as well as a nine-hole golf course and a "motor court" with its own garage and gas pumps, according toArchitectural Digest.Then, in July, Bezos appeared to make another purchase, this time right next door: a $10 million home that shares a hedge line with the Warner estate. According to property records viewed by bothVarietyandDaily Mail, Bezos is the new owner of the 1930s-era home on a side street in Beverly Hills' Benedict Canyon neighborhood.In February 2021, Bezos announced that he would step down as CEO of Amazon in the third quarter, with Andy Jassy, the CEO of AWS, taking his place. The move became official on July 5, 2021.Andy Jassy, left, and Jeff Bezos.Mike Blake/Reuters; Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty ImagesSource:InsiderOn July 20, Bezos lifted off aboard a Blue Origin rocket, accompanied by his brother, Mark, 82-hear-old aviator Wally Funk, and Dutch teen Oliver Daemen.

E. Shaw and founded Amazon in a rented garage inBellevue, Washington on July 5, 1994, after writing itsbusiness planon a cross-country drive from New York City toSeattle.[46][47]With Bezos at the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company's first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially.[48]Prior to settling on Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at anIndian reservationnearSan Franciscoin order to avoid paying taxes.[49]Bezos initially named his new companyCadabrabut later changed the name toAmazonafter theAmazon Riverin South America, in part because the name begins with the letterA, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[50]At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with "A" would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches.[51]In addition, he regarded "Amazon," the name of the world's largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world's largest online bookstore.[51]He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents as investment in Amazon.[47][52][53]He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[54]Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[44][50]Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with aninitial public offering(IPO).[55]In response to critical reports fromFortuneandBarron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such asBordersandBarnes & Noble.[50]In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company's products to include a variety of otherconsumer goods.[50]Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company's 1997equity offeringto finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[50]In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350 million.[56]In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launchAmazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels andwebsite traffic.[50]In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[57]After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[56]In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400 million.[58][failed verification]In November 2007, Bezos launched theAmazon Kindle.[59]According to a 2008Timeprofile, Bezos wished to create a device that allowed a "flow state" in reading similar to the experience of video games.[60]In 2013, Bezos secured a $600-million contract with theCentral Intelligence Agency(CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[61]In October of that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[62]Bezos in 2010In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[63]On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7 million.[64]A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[65]By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109 billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular,Blue Origin.[66]On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon'sSuper Bowl commercial.[67]On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterlyearningsof $2 billion.[68]Due to the growth ofAlibabain China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon intoIndia.[69]On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became theworld's wealthiest personoverMicrosoftco-founderBill Gateswhen his estimatednet worthincreased to just over $90 billion.

If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America."[81]Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary "misleading" as it included part-time workers.[82]However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[83]On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[84]The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour, a decision that was interpreted as support for theFight for $15movement.[85]In February 2021, Bezos announced that in thethird quarterof 2021 he would step down from his role as CEO of Amazon to become the Executive Chairman of the Amazon Board. He was succeeded as CEO byAndy Jassy.[86][87][88]On February 2, 2021, Bezos sent an email[89]to all Amazon employees, telling them the transition would give him "the time and energy [he] need[s] to focus on theDay 1 Fund, theBezos Earth Fund,Blue Origin,The Washington Post, and [his] other passions."[90]Blue OriginMain article:Blue OriginBezos andRob Meyerson(fifth from left) giving NASA Deputy AdministratorLori Garver(fourth from left) a tour of Blue Origin's crew capsule in 2011U.S. Secretary of DefenseAsh Cartermeets with Bezos in 2016 atThe Pentagon.In September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, ahuman spaceflightstartup.[91]Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel and the development of human life in the Solar System.[35]His 1982 high schoolvaledictoriansenior graduation speech was followed up with aMiami Heraldinterview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for human beings who were in orbit.[92]The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse throughresource depletion.[93]Rob Meyersonled Blue Origin from 2003 to 2017 and served as its first president.[94]After its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006 when it purchased a large tract of land inWest Texasfor a launch and test facility.[95]After the company gained the public's attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing thecost of space travelfor humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[96]In September 2011, one of the company's uncrewed prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight.

Bezos was a multi-billionaire who drove a 1996Honda Accord.[139]Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[140][141][142]Bezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[143][144]This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman, who described him as "talking in lists" and "[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made."[140]Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrotea bookthat described Bezos as a demanding boss as well ashyper-competitive,[136][143]and opined that Bezos perhaps "bet the biggest on the Internet" than anyone else.[145]Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles andexternalities.[146][147]During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift.

Shawand again during the early years of Amazon. He described thislife philosophyby stating: "When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes."[162]During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.[38]To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed themantra"Get Big Fast", establishing the company's need toscaleits operations to produce market dominance.[50]He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form ofdividends.[140]Bezos uses the term "work–life harmony" instead of the more standard "work–life balance" because he believes thatbalanceimplies that you can only have one and not the other. He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other.[163]JournalistWalt Mossbergdubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique shouldn't do anything new or interesting "The Bezos Principle".[164]Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule—a preference that meetings are small enough for twopizzasto feed everyone in the boardroom.[165]When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon, he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise thecommon standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.[166]In 2018, it was reported that he met with Amazon investors for just six hours a year.[165]Instead of usingpresentation slides, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives.[167]Since 1998, Bezos has published an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers, not competitors; take risks formarket leadership; facilitate staff morale; build acompany culture; and empower people.[168][169]Bezos maintains the email address jeff@amazon.com[170]as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company. Although he does not respond to the emails, he forwards some of them with a question mark in the subject line to executives who attempt to address the issues.[171]Bezos has citedJeff ImmeltofNew Enterprise Associates,[172]Warren BuffettofBerkshire Hathaway,Jamie DimonofJPMorgan Chase, andBob IgerofThe Walt Disney Companyas major influences on his leadership style.[172][173]RecognitionIn 1999, Bezos received his first major award whenTimenamed himPerson of the Year.[174]In 2008, he was selected byU.S. News & World Reportas one of America's best leaders.[175]Bezos was awarded an honorary doctorate in science and technology fromCarnegie Mellon Universityin 2008.[176]In 2011,The Economistgave Bezos and Gregg Zehr an Innovation Award for theAmazon Kindle.[177]In 2012, Bezos was named Businessperson of the Year byFortune.[178]He is also a member of theBilderberg Groupand attended the 2011 Bilderberg conference inSt. Moritz, Switzerland,[179]and the2013 conferenceinWatford, Hertfordshire, England.

However, Bezos would keep all of the couple's voting rights.[262]He is the Honorary Chair of theExplorers Club.[263]PoliticsIndian Prime MinisterNarendra Modipresenting the USIBC Global Leadership Award to Bezos, in Washington, D.C. on June 7, 2016British Prime MinisterBoris Johnsonmeets with Bezos during the United Nations General Assembly, in New York City on September 20, 2021.According to publiccampaign finance records, Bezos supported the electoral campaigns ofPatty MurrayandMaria Cantwell, twoDemocraticU.S. senators from Washington.

According to BBC, Bezos's top security staffer,Gavin de Becker,[283]"linked the hack to theWashington Post's coverage of the murder of Saudi writerJamal Khashoggiat the Saudi consulate in Istanbul". Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and dissident was employed as a writer at theWashington Post, owned by Bezos. Khashoggi was killed in late 2018, in Turkey's Saudi consulate for his critical stance and journalism against the Saudi government and its leader.[284]In January 2020,The Guardianreported that the hack was initiated before the murder but after Khashoggi wrote critically about the crown prince in theWashington Post. Forensic analysis of Bezos's mobile phone conducted by advisory firmFTI Consulting, concluded it "highly probable" that the hack was achieved using a malicious file hidden in a video sent in aWhatsAppmessage to Bezos from the personal account of the crown prince on May 1, 2018.[285][286]Saudi Arabia has denied the claim.[287]PhilanthropyBezos funded the retrieval of theseF-1 engineparts from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean in 2015, eventually donating them to theSeattle Museum of Flight.

When he was designated the "world wealthiest person" on March 6, 2018, theForbesThe World's Billionaireslist stipulated that although Bezos was the firstcenti-billionaire(i.e. +US$100 billion in net worth), it wasBill Gateswho had the most money when taken inreal terms.[220]In such terms, Gates had $150 billion while Bezos had $100 billion. However, in July 2018, the net worth of Bezos officially surpassed the $150 billion mark, which led most major wealth indexes to label him the wealthiest person in modern history (post-1982).[221]References^Jonge, Peter de (March 14, 1999)."Riding the Wild, Perilous Waters of Amazone.com".The New York Times.ISSN0362-4331.

He was high schoolvaledictorian, aNational Merit Scholar,[34][35]and aSilver Knight Awardwinner in 1982.[34]In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind wouldcolonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park".[36]In 1986, he graduatedsumma cum laudefromPrinceton Universitywith a 4.2GPAand aBachelor of Science in Engineeringdegree (B.S.E.) inelectrical engineeringandcomputer science; he was also a member ofPhi Beta Kappa.[37][38]While at Princeton, Bezos was a member of theQuadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[39]In addition, he was elected toTau Beta Piand was the president of the Princeton chapter of theStudents for the Exploration and Development of Space(SEDS).[40][41]Business careerEarly careerAfter Bezos graduated from college in 1986, he was offered jobs atIntel,Bell Labs, andAndersen Consulting, among others.[42]He first worked at Fitel, afintechtelecommunicationsstart-up, where he was tasked with building a network forinternational trade.[43]Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter. He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager atBankers Trustfrom 1988 to 1990. He then joinedD. E. Shaw & Co, a newly createdhedge fundwith a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling from 1990 until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president by age 30.[44][42]AmazonMain article:AmazonBezos (front row, center) at the Robot Co-op in 2005In late 1993, Bezos read that the Internet was growing at a rate of 2300% a year and decided to establish anonline bookstore.[45]He and his then-wife,MacKenzie Scott, left their jobs at D. E. Shaw and founded Amazon in a rented garage inBellevue, Washington on July 5, 1994, after writing itsbusiness planon a cross-country drive from New York City toSeattle.[46][47]With Bezos at the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company's first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially.[48]Prior to settling on Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at anIndian reservationnearSan Franciscoin order to avoid paying taxes.[49]Bezos initially named his new companyCadabrabut later changed the name toAmazonafter theAmazon Riverin South America, in part because the name begins with the letterA, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[50]At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with "A" would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches.[51]In addition, he regarded "Amazon," the name of the world's largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world's largest online bookstore.[51]He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents as investment in Amazon.[47][52][53]He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[54]Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[44][50]Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with aninitial public offering(IPO).[55]In response to critical reports fromFortuneandBarron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such asBordersandBarnes & Noble.[50]In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company's products to include a variety of otherconsumer goods.[50]Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company's 1997equity offeringto finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[50]In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350 million.[56]In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launchAmazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels andwebsite traffic.[50]In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[57]After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[56]In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400 million.[58][failed verification]In November 2007, Bezos launched theAmazon Kindle.[59]According to a 2008Timeprofile, Bezos wished to create a device that allowed a "flow state" in reading similar to the experience of video games.[60]In 2013, Bezos secured a $600-million contract with theCentral Intelligence Agency(CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[61]In October of that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[62]Bezos in 2010In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[63]On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7 million.[64]A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[65]By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109 billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular,Blue Origin.[66]On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon'sSuper Bowl commercial.[67]On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterlyearningsof $2 billion.[68]Due to the growth ofAlibabain China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon intoIndia.[69]On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became theworld's wealthiest personoverMicrosoftco-founderBill Gateswhen his estimatednet worthincreased to just over $90 billion. His wealth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world byForbeson March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112 billion.[70]Bezos receives theJames Smithson Bicentennialmedal on June 14, 2016, for his work with Amazon.[71]In March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon's global senior vice president, to India with $5.5 billion to localize operations throughout the company'ssupply chainroutes.[72]Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon and Bezos, specifically ofsales taxavoidance, misusingpostal routes, andanti-competitivebusiness practices.[73]Amazon's share price fell by 9% in response to the President's negative comments; this reduced Bezos's personal wealth by $10.7 billion.[74]Weeks later, Bezos recouped his losses when academic reports out ofStanford Universityindicated that Trump could do little to regulate Amazon in any meaningful way.[75]During July 2018, a number of members of the U.S. Congress called on Bezos to detail the applications of Amazon'sface recognitionsoftware,Rekognition.[76]Bezos on October 25, 2017, on his visit toLos Angeles Air Force Base.[77]Criticism of Amazon's business practices continued in September 2018 when SenatorBernie Sandersintroduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receivingcorporate welfare.[78]This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers inArizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers inPennsylvaniaandOhio, relied on food stamps.[79]While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: "Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?"[80]He later said: "Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America."[81]Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary "misleading" as it included part-time workers.[82]However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[83]On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[84]The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour, a decision that was interpreted as support for theFight for $15movement.[85]In February 2021, Bezos announced that in thethird quarterof 2021 he would step down from his role as CEO of Amazon to become the Executive Chairman of the Amazon Board. He was succeeded as CEO byAndy Jassy.[86][87][88]On February 2, 2021, Bezos sent an email[89]to all Amazon employees, telling them the transition would give him "the time and energy [he] need[s] to focus on theDay 1 Fund, theBezos Earth Fund,Blue Origin,The Washington Post, and [his] other passions."[90]Blue OriginMain article:Blue OriginBezos andRob Meyerson(fifth from left) giving NASA Deputy AdministratorLori Garver(fourth from left) a tour of Blue Origin's crew capsule in 2011U.S. Secretary of DefenseAsh Cartermeets with Bezos in 2016 atThe Pentagon.In September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, ahuman spaceflightstartup.[91]Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel and the development of human life in the Solar System.[35]His 1982 high schoolvaledictoriansenior graduation speech was followed up with aMiami Heraldinterview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for human beings who were in orbit.[92]The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse throughresource depletion.[93]Rob Meyersonled Blue Origin from 2003 to 2017 and served as its first president.[94]After its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006 when it purchased a large tract of land inWest Texasfor a launch and test facility.[95]After the company gained the public's attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing thecost of space travelfor humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[96]In September 2011, one of the company's uncrewed prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight. Although the crash was viewed as a setback, news outlets noted how far the company went from its founding-to-date in advancingspaceflight.[97]After the crash, Bezos has been superstitiously wearing his "lucky" TexasCowboy bootsto all rocket launches.[98]In May 2013, Bezos met withRichard Branson, chairman ofVirgin Galactic, to discuss commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies.[99]He has been compared to Branson andElon Muskas all three are billionaires who prioritize spaceflight among their business interests.[100]In 2015, Bezos announced that a neworbital launch vehiclewas under development and would make its first flight in the late-2010s.[101]Later in November, Blue Origin'sNew Shepardspace vehicle successfully rocketed into space and reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers) before executing avertical landingback at the launch site in West Texas. In 2016, Bezos allowed select journalists to visit, tour, and photograph his facility.[102]He has repeatedly called for increased inter-space energy and industrial manufacturing to decrease the negative costs associated withbusiness-related pollution.[103]In December 2017, New Shepard successfully flew and landeddummy passengers, amending and pushing its human space travel start date into late 2018.[104]To execute this program, Blue Origin built six of the vehicles to support all phases of testing and operations: no-passenger test flights, flights with test passengers, and commercial-passenger weekly operations.[105]Since 2016, Bezos has spoken more freely about his hopes tocolonize the solar system, and has been selling US$1 billion in Amazon stock each year to capitalize Blue Origin in an effort to support this endeavor.[106][107]In May 2018, Bezos maintained that the primary goal of Blue Origin is to preserve thenatural resources of Earthby making the human speciesmulti-planetary.[108]He announced thatNew Shepardwould begin transporting humans intosub-orbital spaceby November 2018.[108]In July 2018, it was announced that Bezos had priced commercial spaceflight tickets from $200,000 to $300,000 per person.[109]On July 20, 2021, he launched on theNS-16mission with his half-brother Mark Bezos,Wally Funk, andOliver Daemen.[110]He launched nine days afterRichard Bransonlaunched onboard theVirgin Galactic Unity 22mission.

That $250,000 investment resulted in 3.3 million shares of Google stock, worth about $3.1 billion in 2017.[120][121]He also invested inUnity Biotechnology, a life-extension research firm hoping to slow or stop the process of aging.[122]Bezos is involved in the healthcare sector, which includes investments in Unity Biotechnology,GRAIL,Juno Therapeutics, andZocdoc.[123]In January 2018, an announcement was made concerning Bezos's role within a new, unnamed healthcare company. This venture, later namedHaven, is expected to be a partnership between Amazon,JPMorgan, andBerkshire Hathaway.[124][125]Bezos also supports philanthropic efforts through direct donations and non-profit projects funded by Bezos Expeditions.[126]Bezos used Bezos Expeditions to fund several philanthropic projects, including an Innovation center at the Seattle Museum of History and Industry and the Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics atPrinceton Neuroscience Institute.[127][128]In 2013, Bezos Expeditions funded the recovery of twoSaturn Vfirst-stageRocketdyne F-1engines from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.[129]They were positively identified as belonging to theApollo 11mission'sS-1C stagefrom July 1969.[130][131]The engines are currently on display at theSeattle Museum of Flight.[132][133]Altos LabsMain article:Altos LabsIn September 2021, Bezos co-founded Altos Labs withMail.rufounderYuri Milner.

Bezos was a multi-billionaire who drove a 1996Honda Accord.[139]Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[140][141][142]Bezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[143][144]This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman, who described him as "talking in lists" and "[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made."[140]Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrotea bookthat described Bezos as a demanding boss as well ashyper-competitive,[136][143]and opined that Bezos perhaps "bet the biggest on the Internet" than anyone else.[145]Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles andexternalities.[146][147]During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to weartailored clothing; heweight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[148]His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as themetonymof the company.[149][150]His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has beenparodiedas an enterprisingsupervillain.[151][152][153]Since 2017, he has been portrayed byKyle MooneyandSteve CarellonSaturday Night Live, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure.[154][better source needed]In May 2014, theInternational Trade Union Confederationnamed Bezos the "World's Worst Boss", with its general secretarySharan Burrowsaying: "Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model",[155]while in 2019,Harvard Business Review, which ranked Bezos the best-performing CEO for 4 years in a row since 2014, did not rank him even in the top 100, citing Amazon's "relatively low ESG (environment,social, andgovernance) scores" that reflect "risks created byworking conditionsand employment policies,data security, andantitrustissues."[156]During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses.[27]His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016.[157][27]Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing aNew York Timespiece.[158][159]Leadership style"Day 1" Management PhilosophyDay 1:start upDay 2:stasisDay 3:irrelevanceDay 4: "excruciating, painful decline"Day 5:deathBezos has stated "it is always Day 1" to describe hisgrowth mindset.[160][161]Bezos used what he called a "regret-minimization framework" while he worked atD. E. Shawand again during the early years of Amazon. He described thislife philosophyby stating: "When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes."[162]During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.[38]To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed themantra"Get Big Fast", establishing the company's need toscaleits operations to produce market dominance.[50]He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form ofdividends.[140]Bezos uses the term "work–life harmony" instead of the more standard "work–life balance" because he believes thatbalanceimplies that you can only have one and not the other. He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other.[163]JournalistWalt Mossbergdubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique shouldn't do anything new or interesting "The Bezos Principle".[164]Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule—a preference that meetings are small enough for twopizzasto feed everyone in the boardroom.[165]When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon, he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise thecommon standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.[166]In 2018, it was reported that he met with Amazon investors for just six hours a year.[165]Instead of usingpresentation slides, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives.[167]Since 1998, Bezos has published an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers, not competitors; take risks formarket leadership; facilitate staff morale; build acompany culture; and empower people.[168][169]Bezos maintains the email address jeff@amazon.com[170]as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company. Although he does not respond to the emails, he forwards some of them with a question mark in the subject line to executives who attempt to address the issues.[171]Bezos has citedJeff ImmeltofNew Enterprise Associates,[172]Warren BuffettofBerkshire Hathaway,Jamie DimonofJPMorgan Chase, andBob IgerofThe Walt Disney Companyas major influences on his leadership style.[172][173]RecognitionIn 1999, Bezos received his first major award whenTimenamed himPerson of the Year.[174]In 2008, he was selected byU.S. News & World Reportas one of America's best leaders.[175]Bezos was awarded an honorary doctorate in science and technology fromCarnegie Mellon Universityin 2008.[176]In 2011,The Economistgave Bezos and Gregg Zehr an Innovation Award for theAmazon Kindle.[177]In 2012, Bezos was named Businessperson of the Year byFortune.[178]He is also a member of theBilderberg Groupand attended the 2011 Bilderberg conference inSt. Moritz, Switzerland,[179]and the2013 conferenceinWatford, Hertfordshire, England.

The Amazon CEO, 55, invited Perry and Lil Nas X to perform on the big stage.The group took silly photos together backstage, which they each posted on their respective social media accounts later that night.“I am now the new owner of amazon and i stolekaty perry‘s dog,” the 20-year-old “Old Town Road” rapper wrote ofhis post. The first picture features the trio smiling together, while Lil Nas X holds Perry’s dog, Nugget. In a second photo, Bezos is seen wearing Lil Nas X’s graffitied coat, leaving the rapper shirtless.“Never forget when our buddy Jeff borrowed your coat,” Perry, 34, commented.Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus Congratulate Billie Eilish on Dethroning ‘Old Town Road’ as No. 1 SongThe “Never Really Over” singerposted the same photo to Instagram, making a “punny” Amazon-themed caption.“I’m having the PRIME of my life,” she joked.Bezos too posted a candid of the three laughing before the show, writing “…and I had some fun with @LilNasX and @KatyPerry backstage.”In a previous post, Bezos shared a video of himself introducing Perry onstage.“I want to say thank you. It was another great Prime Day. I remember it was just a little over 20 years ago, I was driving all the packages to the post office myself. That wasn’t that long ago,” he said.“And when I look out at this crowd, I am in awe of what you guys do. Not just on Prime Day, but every day. The curiosity, the passion, the hard work, everything that I see when I get to work with you guys, it’s just amazing to me and it’s awe-inspiring. So thank you very much”“And now enough small talk — let’s bring outKaty Perry!”The singer gave a special concert, gifting the crowd with her first-ever live performance of her single “Never Really Over.”Taylor Swift Performs in NYC at First Public Appearance Since Scooter Braun and Big Machine FeudBezos’last Prime Day concertwas on July 10 in New York City withTaylor Swiftheadlining.Glee‘s Jane Lynch hosted the event, which also featured performances by SZA, Becky G, and Dua Lipa.Related ArticlesAmerican Music Awards 2022 — See the Complete Winners List!Lil Nas X Paused His Atlanta Concert to Tell the Audience He Was Pooping: 'I'll Be Right Back'Kate Upton Celebrates the World Series, Plus Ellie Kemper, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and MoreOlivia Wilde Steps Out Post Workout, Plus Mariah Carey, Rory Culkin and MoreJoni Mitchell Meets the Cast of 'Almost Famous,' Plus Priyanka Chopra, Jenna Dewan and MoreKendrick Lamar, Jack Harlow and Lil Nas X Lead 2022 MTV VMA NominationsDua Lipa and Anwar Hadid's Relationship TimelineKaty Perry and Orlando Bloom's Relationship TimelineCelebrities Who Have Publicly Squashed Rumored Feuds — with a Smile!Watch The Kid LAROI Bring Out The Wiggles to Perform 'Hot Potato' and 'Fruit Salad' in MelbourneThe Best Moments from the 2022 Grammy AwardsChance the Rapper Brings the Love to Sweden, Plus the Beckhams, Cynthia Erivo, Idina Menzel and MoreJack Harlow Performs Live on' TODAY', Plus H.E.R., Chris Martin, Pusha T and MoreJustin Bieber Performs Abroad, Plus Jennifer Hudson, the 'Ted Lasso' Cast, Larsa Pippen and MoreDua Lipa Performs in Hungary, Plus Madonna, Jamie Foxx & Snoop, the Duplass Family and MoreUsher Performs at the Songwriters Hall of Fame Gala in N.Y.C., Plus Tom Cruise, Lil Nas X and MorePEOPLENewsletterFollow UsNewsEntertainmentRoyalsLifestyleStyleWatchShoppingAbout UsPEOPLE TestedEditorial PolicyCareersPrivacy PolicyContact UsTerms of UseAdvertiseDo Not Sell My Personal InformationPEOPLE is part of theDotdash Meredithpublishing family.Newsletter Sign UpNewsletter Sign UpBy clicking “Accept All Cookies”, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.Cookies SettingsAccept All Cookies

"And it's probably the smartest thing we ever did."To replace the PowerPoint presentations, Bezos created a new way to hold meetings: Meetings start with each attendee sitting and silently reading a "six-page, narratively-structured memo" for about the first 30 minutes of the meeting."[The memo is] supposed to create the context for what will then be a good discussion," Bezos said.Those participating are encouraged to take notes, and after the reading period is over, they discuss the memo.Bezos says the reason for the group reading is that "executives will bluff their way through the meeting as if they've read the memo because we're busy and so you've got to actually carve out the time for the memo to get read."Bezos is not the only CEO to believe in "silent meetings": Twitter and Square CEOJack Dorsey uses a similar method, which includes holding meetings that start with 10 minutes of silent reading from a Google Doc."Most of my meetings are now Google doc-based, starting with 10 minutes of reading and commenting directly in the doc," Dorsey tweeted in 2018. "This practice makes time for everyone to get on same page, allows us to work from many locations, and gets to truth/critical thinking faster."As for Amazon, before the memo-based meetings were instituted, "we were doing the more traditional thing," Bezos said. "A junior executive comes in, they put a huge amount of effort into developing a PowerPoint presentation, they put the third slide up, and the most senior executive in the room has already interrupted them, thrown them off their game, asking questions about what is going to be presented in slide six, if they would just stay quiet for a moment..."He explained that PowerPoint slides often have "obscure information." Bezos prefers memos, he says, because each have "verbs and sentences and topic sentences and complete paragraphs."In his2017 letter to shareholders, Bezos said by "tradition at Amazon, authors' names never appear on the memos. The memo is from the whole team.""The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind," he said in the 2017 letter. "They simply can't be done in a day or two.""[It] is harder for the author, but it forces the author to clarify their own thinking," he said at the Forum on Leadership. "It totally revolutionizes the way we do meetings at Amazon."Like this story?Subscribe to CNBC Make It on YouTube!Don't miss:See the portraits of Jeff Bezos and Lin-Manuel Miranda that are headed to the National Portrait GalleryProductivity tips from Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Steve Jobs6 things successful people like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos do on weekends to make their Mondays more productiveVIDEO0:0000:00Jeff Bezos sends a birthday message to his fourth-grade teacherMake ItStay in the loopGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inboxSign UpAbout UsLearn more about the world of CNBC Make ItLearn MoreFollow UsCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel©2023CNBC LLC.

As a child the Amazon founder spent his summers reading Asimov and Heinlein, and according to Christian Davenport, who profiled Bezos in his bookThe Space Barons, he’s a hardcoreStar Trekfan.“He named his dog Kamala, after one of the characters, and one of his holding companies is Zefram LLC, named for the character inStar Trekwho created the warp drive,” Davenport says in Episode 345 of theGeek’s Guide to the Galaxypodcast. “He even had a cameo in one of theStar Trekfilms. So that’s obviously a huge influence on him.”Podcasthttps://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/geeksguide345final.mp3RSSiTunesDownloadScience fiction also played a role in the creation ofBlue Origin, the rocket company that Bezos founded in 2000. The year before, Bezos had watched the movieOctober Sky, about NASA engineer Homer Hickam, with science fiction authorNeal Stephenson. Afterward they were discussing the film.“[Jeff] says to Neal Stephenson, ‘I’ve always wanted to start a rocket company, that’s always been my dream,'” Davenport says. “And Neal Stephenson just said, ‘Do it. Do it today.’ And soon thereafter, he did.”Despite his busy schedule, Bezos still makes time to read new science fiction from writers such as Alastair Reynolds, Ernest Cline, and Andy Weir. “I got the sense that that’s important to him, to sort of nourish his mind,” Davenport says. “So he definitely tries to keep up on that stuff.”Bezos has also moved to acquire more science fiction for Amazon’s streaming service. Novels by Iain Banks, Larry Niven, and Neal Stephenson are all in development, and last spring Amazon savedThe Expanseafter it was canceled by Syfy.“Something that [Jeff] wants to do is not just to have success in space—to make rockets that are reusable—but to reinvigorate interest in space,” Davenport says. “And I thought savingThe Expansewas a great way to do that.”Listen to the complete interview with Christian Davenport in Episode 345 ofGeek’s Guide to the Galaxy(above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below.Christian Davenport on interviewing Jeff Bezos:“What I found in the archives was the press release from when Jeff’s grandfather left ARPA to go back to work at the Atomic Energy Commission, and the press release had a picture of his grandfather on it—a very big picture. And so I saw him a few months later and handed him the press release, which he had never seen—and I could see the expression on his face—and I just said, ‘I’m putting my cards on the table. I’m writing this book, and I’m just really trying to impress you with the level of research I’m doing.’ And then I thought I had him, and he said, ‘I’m inclined to participate.’ Then it took another couple of months of working with his people to get on the schedule, but then I did.”Related StoriesGeek's Guide to the GalaxyBeing a Hollywood Science Consultant Isn’t Exactly GlamorousGeek's Guide to the GalaxyDoctorWhoIs Reaching a Whole New AudienceGeek's Guide to the GalaxySci-Fi Writers Are Grappling With a Post-Trump RealityChristian Davenport on the future:“[Jeff] gives this stump speech about how we shouldgo out to space to preserve Earth, and today the line he says is, ‘Earth should be zoned residential,’ that Earth is this really magnificent place, with waterfalls and palm trees and snow and bacon and wine and whiskey, and all these wonderful things, and that other planets—like Mars, for example—which is whereElon Muskwants to go, are really desolate, and hard places to live. … So that’s what he talks about today, but when he was 18 years old and giving a speech at his high school, it was virtually the same speech, but instead of saying ‘Earth should be zoned residential’ he said ‘Earth should be preserved as a National Park.’ So obviously this is something he’s been thinking about for a very long time.”Christian Davenport on Blue Origin:“[Jeff] turned to me and he said, ‘Do you know how a bullwhip works?’ And I was like, ‘What do you mean?’ And he said, ‘Well, that crack, there’s a mini sonic boom in there. You can get the whip to go faster than the speed of sound just with your arm, and the way that works is that momentum is mass times velocity, and so as your mass decreases—toward the end of the whip—your velocity has to increase.’ And so I’m digesting that and letting it sink in, and then I’m like, ‘So you were going to bullwhip people into space?’ And he’s like, ‘Well, no, no, no. Not people. But maybe satellites or cargo, and things like that.’ But they could see that this was an idea that wasn’t going to work.”Christian Davenport on the space industry:“What I’ve noticed, just in reporting this over the last five years, is how the investment community is becoming more interested in space. I think early on space investors were the space geeks, they were the enthusiasts, they were more interested in the dream than they were perhaps in the return on investment. But now you’ve seen more players get into this. I mean, the fact that Google and Fidelity invested a billion dollars intoSpaceXshould tell you something, and the fact that companies like Morgan Stanley are talking about it. Whereas they used to say, ‘The quickest way to become a millionaire in space is to start out as a billionaire,’ now I think people are starting to believe that you can actually make money in space.”More Great WIRED StoriesWeedmaps’ grip on the high-flying Californiapot marketHave phones become boring?

Jeff Bezos and Star Trek: A love affair - The Washington PostAccessibility statementSkip to main contentSearch NavigationDemocracy Dies in DarknessSign inThis article was published more than1yearagoThe Washington PostDemocracy Dies in DarknessPop CultureThe love affair between Jeff Bezos and ‘Star Trek’ByTravis M. AndrewsandRoxanne RobertsUpdatedOctober 13, 2021 at 11:40 a.m. EDT|PublishedOctober 13, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EDTWilliam Shatner in “Star Trek,” circa 1966-1969. (Paramount Television/Kobal/Shutterstock)Listen6 minComment on this storyCommentGiftArticleShareBeam me up, Jeffrey.There’s more than a slight chance those words passed through William Shatner’s mind Wednesday, as the original Captain Kirk headed into space aboard a New Shepard spacecraft owned by Jeff Bezos’s commercial spaceflight venture Blue Origin. He spent just over 10 minutesrocketing upwardmore than 66 miles — four miles beyond the edge of space — and returning to Earth.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightIt was an undoubtedly savvy public relations move for the embattled company, which has recently come under fire for harboring what current and former employees allege, inan essay, is a toxic culture “that ignores the plight of our planet, turns a blind eye to sexism, is not sufficiently attuned to safety concerns, and silences those who seek to correct wrongs.”In fact, as a PR stunt, it’s rivaled only by Blue Origin’s first foray to the cosmos. That found Wally Funk, an 82-year-old aviation pioneer who was supposed to be one of the first women in space back in 1961, accompanying Bezos and his brother, Mark, into space. In addition to the “Star Trek” tie-in, the 90-year-old Shatner became the oldest person ever to exit Earth’s atmosphere, a fact that’s basically catnip for headline-seeking journalists.Inside Blue Origin: Employees say toxic, dysfunctional ‘bro culture’ led to mistrust, low morale and delays at Jeff Bezos’s space ventureUndergirding the PR move, though, might be a personal interest. Bezos has a genuine interest in the “Star Trek” series, which he discusses ad nauseamin interviews and which inspired the name of his dog, Kamala (you know, the Kriosian empathic metamorph).AdvertisementBut when did this love affair begin? What else has the show inspired in his life?We dove into these questions. But first, repeat after us: Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.How did Bezos become interested in space?Bezos fell in love with the universe before he fell in love with “Star Trek.” As a boy, he spent summers in Texas with his grandfather, a former Atomic Energy Commission engineer. The two watched space launches together and shared a love of science fiction.“ ‘Star Trek’ is the easiest thing to glom on to, but it was much more than that,” biographer Brad Stone said in an interview.When he graduated from high school, Bezos ended his valedictorian speech with the words “Space: the final frontier. Meet me there.”As a student at Princeton, Bezos juggled the pop cultureof “Star Trek” with the more serious work of professor and physicist Gerard O’Neill, who foresaw space stations orbiting Earth to house humans. After college, Bezos held “Star Trek: The Next Generation” viewing parties for his friends, Stone said.AdvertisementSpace, real or imagined, was always a big part of his life.When did he fall in love with Star Trek?The show premiered — with Shatner as Captain Kirk — in 1966, two years after Bezos was born. It would take the Amazon founder until the fourth grade to discover the StarshipEnterprise. When he did, he became infatuated with the show in the way only a child can.“When I was in fourth grade, me and my friends Dean and Kyle, who lived next door a couple of houses down, in Houston, Texas, would play ‘Star Trek’ almost every day,” BezostoldWashington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron at a 2016 event hosted by The Post. “And we’d fight over who’d get to be Captain Kirk, or Spock, and somebody used to play the computer, too. And it was actually very fun — we’d have little cardboard phasers and cardboard tricorders, you know. Good days.”Washington Post executive editor Martin Baron interviewed Amazon.com chief executive and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos May 18 at Transformers, a live event by The Washington Post about pushing the boundaries of knowledge. (Video: Washington Post Live)Echoes of the show can be found throughout his life. In addition to naming his dog Kamala, he named one of his holding companies Zefram LLC after Zefram Cochrane, the character who invented the warp drive.AdvertisementHe’s discussed how the show, and his general love of science fiction, helped inspire him to found a commercial spaceflight venture. But the show was also instrumental in creating the Amazon Echo.“Our vision, in the long term, is it would become the ‘Star Trek’ computer. You could ask it anything, ask it to do things for you, ask it to find things for you, and it would be easy to converse with in a very natural way,” he told Baron. “The original inspiration was the ‘Star Trek’ computer.”Who was his favorite character?If you ask an Amazon’s Alexa who’s the best “Star Trek” captain, she will respond, “Of all the captains in all the galaxies, Captain Picard is my favorite.”It’s no coincidence that Bezos feels the same way. He once gleefully shared that with a tickled Patrick Stewart, the actor who portrayed Picard.View this post on InstagramA post shared by Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos)Though Kirk is the one who traveled  to space Wednesday, Bezos has never shied away from reminding the world that he prefers Picard — usuallyon Twitter. “Kirk or Picard? Picard!”Bezos tweetedin March 2018, shortly after walking the red carpet with Stewart at the Academy Awards.AdvertisementHe almost named Amazon “Makeitso.com,” after Picard’s catchphrase, Inc.reported.In fact, “as time has passed, Bezos and Picard have physically converged. Like the interstellar explorer, portrayed by Patrick Stewart, Bezos shaved the remnant strands on his high-gloss pate and acquired a cast-iron physique,” Franklin Foerwrotein the Atlantic in 2019.Bezos has not publicly explained why he admires Picard, but let’s venture a modest guess: Picard is a brilliant officer, historian and diplomat who plays a major role in the events of the 24th century. Even Spock was impressed: “He’s remarkably analytical and dispassionate, for a human. … There’s almost a Vulcan quality to the man.”Is it true that he appeared in a ‘Star Trek’ movie?Affirmative! Bezos played an alien Starfleet officer in the 2016 “Star Trek Beyond,” something he called “a bucket list” dream on Twitter.Advertisement“For years, I have been begging Paramount, which is owned by Viacom, to let me be in a ‘Star Trek’ movie,” he said that year. “I am very persistent, and you can imagine the poor director who got the call: ‘You have to let Jeff Bezos be in your ‘Star Trek’ movie. ”Bezos said he was willing to be unrecognizable but wanted a speaking part — and one that was central to the plot so it didn’t end up on the cutting-room floor.Great thing about making Trek is having passionate people drop by, like@JeffBezos. Here he is with Lydia Wilson.pic.twitter.com/bKkEAmwjDS— Justin Lin (@justinlin)July 20, 2016Bezos appears in the first five minutes of the film as an alien Starfleet officer stationed at Yorktown Starbase in 2263 who scans Kalara as she pleads for help from Commodore Paris and Captain Kirk. “Speak normally,” Bezos tells her. The cameo role required such extensive makeup that he could only drink through a straw.“He was awesome,” director Justin Lin told the Associated Press. “It was like a president was visiting, you know? He had a big entourage! But it didn’t matter because he was so into it. He had to wait around all day because it was one day we were shooting like three different scenes and, it was also credit to Jeff because … he just nailed it every time.”What other science fiction does he enjoy?Although “Star Trek” is his most public sci-fi obsession, it’s far from his only one. As a child, Bezos would hoover up all the Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein books he could get his hands on. Nowadays, he makes sure to read newer genre writers such as Alastair Reynolds, Ernest Cline and Andy Weir.AdvertisementAmazon Studios, the film and TV arm of his online empire, has focused on producing sci-fi. Most notably, the service saved “The Expanse,” a beloved show based on the novels of James S.A. Corey after it was canceled by its original network, Syfy.“Something that [Bezos] wants to do is not just to have success in space — to make rockets that are reusable — but to reinvigorate interest in space,” The Post’s Christian Davenport said on theGeek’s Guide to the Galaxypodcast.According to Davenport’sreporting, Bezos decided to found Blue Origin after watching “October Sky,” a movie about NASA engineer Homer Hickam, with science fiction writer Neal Stephenson. But, by that point, he had long been interested in space.As his high school girlfriend Ursula Werneronce said: “Jeff started Amazon just to get enough money to do Blue Origin. He was intrigued by the idea of rocketing into outer space.”“I can neither confirm nor deny that,” Bezoslater said, when asked about her theory.In any event, we know one thing for sure: Live long and profit.CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleMore on Blue OriginHAND CURATEDInside Blue Origin: Employees say toxic, dysfunctional ‘bro culture’ led to mistrust, low morale and delays at Jeff Bezos’s space ventureOctober 11, 2021Inside Blue Origin: Employees say toxic, dysfunctional ‘bro culture’ led to mistrust, low morale and delays at Jeff Bezos’s space ventureOctober 11, 2021Blue Origin fired a senior executive, citing inappropriate behavior.

The 'seminal' moment for him, sparked a life-long passion with outer space.His first successful commercial flight to the edge of Earth's atmosphere this morning not only marks the fruition of a childhood dream - but the full evolution of his die-hard obsession with Star Trek.After returning from the 10-minute tour into space with his brother, Mark Bezos, Oliver Daemen, and 82-year-old aviation pioneer, Wally Funk - Bezos exclaimed that it was the 'best day ever!'The billionaire has made no secret of his ambition to relocate humans to massive spinning space colonies akin to the ships in his favorite sci-fi television series, Star Trek. It eventually led to his founding of Blue Origin in the year 2000.In fact, Star Trek has been a thread of inspiration for many decisions over the years. In 2016, hetoldthe Washington Post that he modeled Amazon's Echo deviceafter the voice activated talking computers on Starship Enterprise.Long before that, Bezos considered naming his trillion dollar e-commerce company 'MakeItSo.com,' as a tribute to a catch phrase used by his hero, the fictional character, 'Captain Jean-Luc Picard.'Over the years, Bezos has slowly modeled his image off Picard's look. Sometime in 2013, Bezos shaved the residue strands on his balding hairline to copy the look of his interstellar idol.Driving Jeff Bezos' vision to colonize space is the product his lifelong obsession with Star Trek and sci-fi novels. He is said to have modeled his look after his hero, the fictional character named 'Captain Jean-Luc Picard'Bezos recalled playing Star Trek with his friends everyday in grade school: 'We would fight over who got to be Captain Kirk (above) or Mr. Spock, and somebody played the computer too. We made little cardboard phasers and tricorders. Good days'Bezos' lifelong spacefaring ambitions are no secret. He has invested billions of his own money into making Blue Origin a success.

'For years, I have been begging Paramount to let me be in a Star Trek movie,' he told an audience at Comic-Con. 'I said, 'Look, I’ll put any amount of makeup on. I’ll be invisible, nobody will know it’s me. But I want a speaking part, and I want it to be in a scene that is central to the story line'Atlantic staff writer Franklin Foer says that Bezos ambitions conjure a more nefarious aspect of the Star Trek universe. 'The man who styles himself as the heroic Jean-Luc Picard has thus built a business that better resembles Picard's archenemy, the Borg'Bezos presents an artist rendering of what space colonies can look like. Inspired by a book called The High Frontier he imagines 'mile long cyndrical tubes' that would sustain an entire biosphere.

He was high schoolvaledictorian, aNational Merit Scholar,[34][35]and aSilver Knight Awardwinner in 1982.[34]In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind wouldcolonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park".[36]In 1986, he graduatedsumma cum laudefromPrinceton Universitywith a 4.2GPAand aBachelor of Science in Engineeringdegree (B.S.E.) inelectrical engineeringandcomputer science; he was also a member ofPhi Beta Kappa.[37][38]While at Princeton, Bezos was a member of theQuadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[39]In addition, he was elected toTau Beta Piand was the president of the Princeton chapter of theStudents for the Exploration and Development of Space(SEDS).[40][41]Business careerEarly careerAfter Bezos graduated from college in 1986, he was offered jobs atIntel,Bell Labs, andAndersen Consulting, among others.[42]He first worked at Fitel, afintechtelecommunicationsstart-up, where he was tasked with building a network forinternational trade.[43]Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter. He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager atBankers Trustfrom 1988 to 1990. He then joinedD. E. Shaw & Co, a newly createdhedge fundwith a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling from 1990 until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president by age 30.[44][42]AmazonMain article:AmazonBezos (front row, center) at the Robot Co-op in 2005In late 1993, Bezos read that the Internet was growing at a rate of 2300% a year and decided to establish anonline bookstore.[45]He and his then-wife,MacKenzie Scott, left their jobs at D. E. Shaw and founded Amazon in a rented garage inBellevue, Washington on July 5, 1994, after writing itsbusiness planon a cross-country drive from New York City toSeattle.[46][47]With Bezos at the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company's first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially.[48]Prior to settling on Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at anIndian reservationnearSan Franciscoin order to avoid paying taxes.[49]Bezos initially named his new companyCadabrabut later changed the name toAmazonafter theAmazon Riverin South America, in part because the name begins with the letterA, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[50]At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with "A" would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches.[51]In addition, he regarded "Amazon," the name of the world's largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world's largest online bookstore.[51]He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents as investment in Amazon.[47][52][53]He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[54]Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[44][50]Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with aninitial public offering(IPO).[55]In response to critical reports fromFortuneandBarron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such asBordersandBarnes & Noble.[50]In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company's products to include a variety of otherconsumer goods.[50]Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company's 1997equity offeringto finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[50]In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350 million.[56]In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launchAmazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels andwebsite traffic.[50]In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[57]After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[56]In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400 million.[58][failed verification]In November 2007, Bezos launched theAmazon Kindle.[59]According to a 2008Timeprofile, Bezos wished to create a device that allowed a "flow state" in reading similar to the experience of video games.[60]In 2013, Bezos secured a $600-million contract with theCentral Intelligence Agency(CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[61]In October of that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[62]Bezos in 2010In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[63]On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7 million.[64]A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[65]By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109 billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular,Blue Origin.[66]On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon'sSuper Bowl commercial.[67]On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterlyearningsof $2 billion.[68]Due to the growth ofAlibabain China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon intoIndia.[69]On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became theworld's wealthiest personoverMicrosoftco-founderBill Gateswhen his estimatednet worthincreased to just over $90 billion. His wealth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world byForbeson March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112 billion.[70]Bezos receives theJames Smithson Bicentennialmedal on June 14, 2016, for his work with Amazon.[71]In March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon's global senior vice president, to India with $5.5 billion to localize operations throughout the company'ssupply chainroutes.[72]Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon and Bezos, specifically ofsales taxavoidance, misusingpostal routes, andanti-competitivebusiness practices.[73]Amazon's share price fell by 9% in response to the President's negative comments; this reduced Bezos's personal wealth by $10.7 billion.[74]Weeks later, Bezos recouped his losses when academic reports out ofStanford Universityindicated that Trump could do little to regulate Amazon in any meaningful way.[75]During July 2018, a number of members of the U.S. Congress called on Bezos to detail the applications of Amazon'sface recognitionsoftware,Rekognition.[76]Bezos on October 25, 2017, on his visit toLos Angeles Air Force Base.[77]Criticism of Amazon's business practices continued in September 2018 when SenatorBernie Sandersintroduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receivingcorporate welfare.[78]This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers inArizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers inPennsylvaniaandOhio, relied on food stamps.[79]While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: "Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?"[80]He later said: "Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America."[81]Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary "misleading" as it included part-time workers.[82]However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[83]On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[84]The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour, a decision that was interpreted as support for theFight for $15movement.[85]In February 2021, Bezos announced that in thethird quarterof 2021 he would step down from his role as CEO of Amazon to become the Executive Chairman of the Amazon Board. He was succeeded as CEO byAndy Jassy.[86][87][88]On February 2, 2021, Bezos sent an email[89]to all Amazon employees, telling them the transition would give him "the time and energy [he] need[s] to focus on theDay 1 Fund, theBezos Earth Fund,Blue Origin,The Washington Post, and [his] other passions."[90]Blue OriginMain article:Blue OriginBezos andRob Meyerson(fifth from left) giving NASA Deputy AdministratorLori Garver(fourth from left) a tour of Blue Origin's crew capsule in 2011U.S. Secretary of DefenseAsh Cartermeets with Bezos in 2016 atThe Pentagon.In September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, ahuman spaceflightstartup.[91]Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel and the development of human life in the Solar System.[35]His 1982 high schoolvaledictoriansenior graduation speech was followed up with aMiami Heraldinterview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for human beings who were in orbit.[92]The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse throughresource depletion.[93]Rob Meyersonled Blue Origin from 2003 to 2017 and served as its first president.[94]After its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006 when it purchased a large tract of land inWest Texasfor a launch and test facility.[95]After the company gained the public's attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing thecost of space travelfor humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[96]In September 2011, one of the company's uncrewed prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight. Although the crash was viewed as a setback, news outlets noted how far the company went from its founding-to-date in advancingspaceflight.[97]After the crash, Bezos has been superstitiously wearing his "lucky" TexasCowboy bootsto all rocket launches.[98]In May 2013, Bezos met withRichard Branson, chairman ofVirgin Galactic, to discuss commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies.[99]He has been compared to Branson andElon Muskas all three are billionaires who prioritize spaceflight among their business interests.[100]In 2015, Bezos announced that a neworbital launch vehiclewas under development and would make its first flight in the late-2010s.[101]Later in November, Blue Origin'sNew Shepardspace vehicle successfully rocketed into space and reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers) before executing avertical landingback at the launch site in West Texas. In 2016, Bezos allowed select journalists to visit, tour, and photograph his facility.[102]He has repeatedly called for increased inter-space energy and industrial manufacturing to decrease the negative costs associated withbusiness-related pollution.[103]In December 2017, New Shepard successfully flew and landeddummy passengers, amending and pushing its human space travel start date into late 2018.[104]To execute this program, Blue Origin built six of the vehicles to support all phases of testing and operations: no-passenger test flights, flights with test passengers, and commercial-passenger weekly operations.[105]Since 2016, Bezos has spoken more freely about his hopes tocolonize the solar system, and has been selling US$1 billion in Amazon stock each year to capitalize Blue Origin in an effort to support this endeavor.[106][107]In May 2018, Bezos maintained that the primary goal of Blue Origin is to preserve thenatural resources of Earthby making the human speciesmulti-planetary.[108]He announced thatNew Shepardwould begin transporting humans intosub-orbital spaceby November 2018.[108]In July 2018, it was announced that Bezos had priced commercial spaceflight tickets from $200,000 to $300,000 per person.[109]On July 20, 2021, he launched on theNS-16mission with his half-brother Mark Bezos,Wally Funk, andOliver Daemen.[110]He launched nine days afterRichard Bransonlaunched onboard theVirgin Galactic Unity 22mission. Bezos'ssuborbital flightlasted over 10 minutes, reaching a peak altitude of 66.5 miles (107.0 km).[111]The Washington PostSee also:The Washington PostOn August 5, 2013, Bezos announced his purchase ofThe Washington Postfor $250 million in cash,[112]at the suggestion of his friend,Don Graham.[113]To execute the sale, he establishedlimited liability companyNash Holdingsto serve as aholding companythrough which he would own the newspaper.[114]The sale closed on October 1, 2013, and Nash Holdings took control.[115]In March 2014, Bezos made his first significant change atThe Washington Postand lifted the online paywall for subscribers of a number of U.S. local newspapers inTexas, Hawaii, andMinnesota.[116]In January 2016, Bezos set out to reinvent the newspaper as a media and technology company by reconstructing its digital media, mobile platforms, and analytics software.[117]After a surge in online readership in 2016, the paper was profitable for the first time since Bezos made the purchase in 2013.[118]Bezos ExpeditionsMain article:Bezos ExpeditionsBezos makes personal investments through hisventure capitalvehicle, Bezos Expeditions.[119]He was one of the firstshareholdersin Google, when he invested $250,000 in 1998. That $250,000 investment resulted in 3.3 million shares of Google stock, worth about $3.1 billion in 2017.[120][121]He also invested inUnity Biotechnology, a life-extension research firm hoping to slow or stop the process of aging.[122]Bezos is involved in the healthcare sector, which includes investments in Unity Biotechnology,GRAIL,Juno Therapeutics, andZocdoc.[123]In January 2018, an announcement was made concerning Bezos's role within a new, unnamed healthcare company. This venture, later namedHaven, is expected to be a partnership between Amazon,JPMorgan, andBerkshire Hathaway.[124][125]Bezos also supports philanthropic efforts through direct donations and non-profit projects funded by Bezos Expeditions.[126]Bezos used Bezos Expeditions to fund several philanthropic projects, including an Innovation center at the Seattle Museum of History and Industry and the Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics atPrinceton Neuroscience Institute.[127][128]In 2013, Bezos Expeditions funded the recovery of twoSaturn Vfirst-stageRocketdyne F-1engines from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.[129]They were positively identified as belonging to theApollo 11mission'sS-1C stagefrom July 1969.[130][131]The engines are currently on display at theSeattle Museum of Flight.[132][133]Altos LabsMain article:Altos LabsIn September 2021, Bezos co-founded Altos Labs withMail.rufounderYuri Milner. Altos Labs is a generously funded biotechnology company dedicated to harnessingcellular reprogrammingto developlongevity therapeutics.[7]The company has recruited prominent scientists such asJuan Carlos Izpisúa Belmonte(known for work on rejuvenation through reprogramming),Steve Horvath(known for work inepigenetic aging clocks), andShinya Yamanaka(theNobel Prize-winning inventor of cellular reprogramming in mammalian cells).[7]The company leftstealth modeand launched on January 19, 2022, with a start capital of $3 billion and an executive team led byHal Barron.[134]Public imageBezos at anaturalizationceremony on June 14, 2016JournalistNellie BowlesofThe New York Timeshas described thepublic personaand personality of Bezos as that of "a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan".[135]During the 1990s, Bezos earned a reputation for relentlessly pushing Amazon forward, often at the expense ofpublic charityand social welfare.[135][136]Journalist Mark O'Connell criticized Bezos's relentless customer focus as "very small" in terms of impact on humanity as a whole,[137]a sentiment technologistTim O'Reillyagreed with.[138]His business practices projected a public image ofprudenceand parsimony with his own wealth and that of Amazon. Bezos was a multi-billionaire who drove a 1996Honda Accord.[139]Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[140][141][142]Bezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[143][144]This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman, who described him as "talking in lists" and "[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made."[140]Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrotea bookthat described Bezos as a demanding boss as well ashyper-competitive,[136][143]and opined that Bezos perhaps "bet the biggest on the Internet" than anyone else.[145]Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles andexternalities.[146][147]During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to weartailored clothing; heweight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[148]His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as themetonymof the company.[149][150]His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has beenparodiedas an enterprisingsupervillain.[151][152][153]Since 2017, he has been portrayed byKyle MooneyandSteve CarellonSaturday Night Live, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure.[154][better source needed]In May 2014, theInternational Trade Union Confederationnamed Bezos the "World's Worst Boss", with its general secretarySharan Burrowsaying: "Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model",[155]while in 2019,Harvard Business Review, which ranked Bezos the best-performing CEO for 4 years in a row since 2014, did not rank him even in the top 100, citing Amazon's "relatively low ESG (environment,social, andgovernance) scores" that reflect "risks created byworking conditionsand employment policies,data security, andantitrustissues."[156]During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses.[27]His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016.[157][27]Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing aNew York Timespiece.[158][159]Leadership style"Day 1" Management PhilosophyDay 1:start upDay 2:stasisDay 3:irrelevanceDay 4: "excruciating, painful decline"Day 5:deathBezos has stated "it is always Day 1" to describe hisgrowth mindset.[160][161]Bezos used what he called a "regret-minimization framework" while he worked atD. E. Shawand again during the early years of Amazon. He described thislife philosophyby stating: "When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street?

He was high schoolvaledictorian, aNational Merit Scholar,[34][35]and aSilver Knight Awardwinner in 1982.[34]In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind wouldcolonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park".[36]In 1986, he graduatedsumma cum laudefromPrinceton Universitywith a 4.2GPAand aBachelor of Science in Engineeringdegree (B.S.E.) inelectrical engineeringandcomputer science; he was also a member ofPhi Beta Kappa.[37][38]While at Princeton, Bezos was a member of theQuadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[39]In addition, he was elected toTau Beta Piand was the president of the Princeton chapter of theStudents for the Exploration and Development of Space(SEDS).[40][41]Business careerEarly careerAfter Bezos graduated from college in 1986, he was offered jobs atIntel,Bell Labs, andAndersen Consulting, among others.[42]He first worked at Fitel, afintechtelecommunicationsstart-up, where he was tasked with building a network forinternational trade.[43]Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter. He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager atBankers Trustfrom 1988 to 1990. He then joinedD. E. Shaw & Co, a newly createdhedge fundwith a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling from 1990 until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president by age 30.[44][42]AmazonMain article:AmazonBezos (front row, center) at the Robot Co-op in 2005In late 1993, Bezos read that the Internet was growing at a rate of 2300% a year and decided to establish anonline bookstore.[45]He and his then-wife,MacKenzie Scott, left their jobs at D. E. Shaw and founded Amazon in a rented garage inBellevue, Washington on July 5, 1994, after writing itsbusiness planon a cross-country drive from New York City toSeattle.[46][47]With Bezos at the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company's first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially.[48]Prior to settling on Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at anIndian reservationnearSan Franciscoin order to avoid paying taxes.[49]Bezos initially named his new companyCadabrabut later changed the name toAmazonafter theAmazon Riverin South America, in part because the name begins with the letterA, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[50]At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with "A" would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches.[51]In addition, he regarded "Amazon," the name of the world's largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world's largest online bookstore.[51]He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents as investment in Amazon.[47][52][53]He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[54]Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[44][50]Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with aninitial public offering(IPO).[55]In response to critical reports fromFortuneandBarron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such asBordersandBarnes & Noble.[50]In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company's products to include a variety of otherconsumer goods.[50]Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company's 1997equity offeringto finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[50]In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350 million.[56]In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launchAmazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels andwebsite traffic.[50]In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[57]After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[56]In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400 million.[58][failed verification]In November 2007, Bezos launched theAmazon Kindle.[59]According to a 2008Timeprofile, Bezos wished to create a device that allowed a "flow state" in reading similar to the experience of video games.[60]In 2013, Bezos secured a $600-million contract with theCentral Intelligence Agency(CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[61]In October of that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[62]Bezos in 2010In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[63]On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7 million.[64]A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[65]By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109 billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular,Blue Origin.[66]On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon'sSuper Bowl commercial.[67]On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterlyearningsof $2 billion.[68]Due to the growth ofAlibabain China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon intoIndia.[69]On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became theworld's wealthiest personoverMicrosoftco-founderBill Gateswhen his estimatednet worthincreased to just over $90 billion. His wealth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world byForbeson March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112 billion.[70]Bezos receives theJames Smithson Bicentennialmedal on June 14, 2016, for his work with Amazon.[71]In March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon's global senior vice president, to India with $5.5 billion to localize operations throughout the company'ssupply chainroutes.[72]Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon and Bezos, specifically ofsales taxavoidance, misusingpostal routes, andanti-competitivebusiness practices.[73]Amazon's share price fell by 9% in response to the President's negative comments; this reduced Bezos's personal wealth by $10.7 billion.[74]Weeks later, Bezos recouped his losses when academic reports out ofStanford Universityindicated that Trump could do little to regulate Amazon in any meaningful way.[75]During July 2018, a number of members of the U.S. Congress called on Bezos to detail the applications of Amazon'sface recognitionsoftware,Rekognition.[76]Bezos on October 25, 2017, on his visit toLos Angeles Air Force Base.[77]Criticism of Amazon's business practices continued in September 2018 when SenatorBernie Sandersintroduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receivingcorporate welfare.[78]This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers inArizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers inPennsylvaniaandOhio, relied on food stamps.[79]While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: "Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?"[80]He later said: "Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America."[81]Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary "misleading" as it included part-time workers.[82]However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[83]On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[84]The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour, a decision that was interpreted as support for theFight for $15movement.[85]In February 2021, Bezos announced that in thethird quarterof 2021 he would step down from his role as CEO of Amazon to become the Executive Chairman of the Amazon Board.

Bezos was a multi-billionaire who drove a 1996Honda Accord.[139]Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[140][141][142]Bezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[143][144]This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman, who described him as "talking in lists" and "[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made."[140]Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrotea bookthat described Bezos as a demanding boss as well ashyper-competitive,[136][143]and opined that Bezos perhaps "bet the biggest on the Internet" than anyone else.[145]Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles andexternalities.[146][147]During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to weartailored clothing; heweight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[148]His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as themetonymof the company.[149][150]His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has beenparodiedas an enterprisingsupervillain.[151][152][153]Since 2017, he has been portrayed byKyle MooneyandSteve CarellonSaturday Night Live, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure.[154][better source needed]In May 2014, theInternational Trade Union Confederationnamed Bezos the "World's Worst Boss", with its general secretarySharan Burrowsaying: "Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model",[155]while in 2019,Harvard Business Review, which ranked Bezos the best-performing CEO for 4 years in a row since 2014, did not rank him even in the top 100, citing Amazon's "relatively low ESG (environment,social, andgovernance) scores" that reflect "risks created byworking conditionsand employment policies,data security, andantitrustissues."[156]During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses.[27]His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016.[157][27]Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing aNew York Timespiece.[158][159]Leadership style"Day 1" Management PhilosophyDay 1:start upDay 2:stasisDay 3:irrelevanceDay 4: "excruciating, painful decline"Day 5:deathBezos has stated "it is always Day 1" to describe hisgrowth mindset.[160][161]Bezos used what he called a "regret-minimization framework" while he worked atD. E. Shawand again during the early years of Amazon. He described thislife philosophyby stating: "When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes."[162]During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.[38]To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed themantra"Get Big Fast", establishing the company's need toscaleits operations to produce market dominance.[50]He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form ofdividends.[140]Bezos uses the term "work–life harmony" instead of the more standard "work–life balance" because he believes thatbalanceimplies that you can only have one and not the other. He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other.[163]JournalistWalt Mossbergdubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique shouldn't do anything new or interesting "The Bezos Principle".[164]Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule—a preference that meetings are small enough for twopizzasto feed everyone in the boardroom.[165]When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon, he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise thecommon standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.[166]In 2018, it was reported that he met with Amazon investors for just six hours a year.[165]Instead of usingpresentation slides, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives.[167]Since 1998, Bezos has published an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers, not competitors; take risks formarket leadership; facilitate staff morale; build acompany culture; and empower people.[168][169]Bezos maintains the email address jeff@amazon.com[170]as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company. Although he does not respond to the emails, he forwards some of them with a question mark in the subject line to executives who attempt to address the issues.[171]Bezos has citedJeff ImmeltofNew Enterprise Associates,[172]Warren BuffettofBerkshire Hathaway,Jamie DimonofJPMorgan Chase, andBob IgerofThe Walt Disney Companyas major influences on his leadership style.[172][173]RecognitionIn 1999, Bezos received his first major award whenTimenamed himPerson of the Year.[174]In 2008, he was selected byU.S. News & World Reportas one of America's best leaders.[175]Bezos was awarded an honorary doctorate in science and technology fromCarnegie Mellon Universityin 2008.[176]In 2011,The Economistgave Bezos and Gregg Zehr an Innovation Award for theAmazon Kindle.[177]In 2012, Bezos was named Businessperson of the Year byFortune.[178]He is also a member of theBilderberg Groupand attended the 2011 Bilderberg conference inSt. Moritz, Switzerland,[179]and the2013 conferenceinWatford, Hertfordshire, England.

When he was designated the "world wealthiest person" on March 6, 2018, theForbesThe World's Billionaireslist stipulated that although Bezos was the firstcenti-billionaire(i.e. +US$100 billion in net worth), it wasBill Gateswho had the most money when taken inreal terms.[220]In such terms, Gates had $150 billion while Bezos had $100 billion. However, in July 2018, the net worth of Bezos officially surpassed the $150 billion mark, which led most major wealth indexes to label him the wealthiest person in modern history (post-1982).[221]References^Jonge, Peter de (March 14, 1999)."Riding the Wild, Perilous Waters of Amazone.com".The New York Times.ISSN0362-4331.

This electric-powered pooch can run for 90 minutes before recharging and weighs around 55 pounds (25 kg). SpotMini made headlines in Feb 2018, when a video of it opening a door despite a human trying to stop it, as a showcase of how robots will eventually take over the world.Taking my new dog for a walk at the #MARS2018 conference. #BostonDynamicsA post shared byJeff Bezos(@jeffbezos) onMar 19, 2018 at 2:31pm PDTLunaDogJeff Bezos has a dog named Luna.Jeff BezosBirthdayJanuary 12, 1964  (59)Links (Tags)BusinessJeff Bezos is an American entrepreneur, investor, and philanthropist. He is best known for being the founder, CEO and chairman of leading online retailer Amazon. With a net worth of $130 billion, he is noted as the world’s richest person and the first person to be worth over $100 billion.Will Jeff Bezos bring his dogs to space next?In July 2021, Jeff Bezos flew to space in his ship, Blue Origin, and became one of the first billionaires to fly into space on their own rocket. He launched a second flight in October 2021 withWilliam Shatneras part of the crew on the second manned launch. At 90, Shatner was the oldest person ever aboard a space flight.Now, the only question we have is: Will Jeff Bezoseverbring dogs to space? He’s invitedTom Hanksamongst other celebrities but what we really want to see are more astronaut pooches, even if it just Spot Minithe robot dog. And, we know he’s cool with them being in theAmazon headquarters.Bezos’ space flight was the second of celebrity space flights withRichard Bransonbeating him out by nine days. Branson’s Virgin Galactic managed heights of 54 miles while Bezos’Blue Origin reached 66 miles. So, if you were going to declare a winner in the epic celebrity space odyssey, you would have to factor in a couple of things. For us, the best celebrity space flight will have to be one with dog astronauts. No question.Who is Jeff Bezos? A Brief HistorySince a young age, Bezos always showed an interesting in science and technology, eventually graduating from Princeton University with Bachelor of Science degrees in computer science and electrical engineering. After graduating, he found work in telecommunications and then banking.After finding success in banking through his 20s, he left to launch his first online venture with an online bookstore named “Amazon” out of his garage. He always planned to expand from books to other products, eventually doing so through capital raised in 1998. After several rough years in the early 2000s, Amazon eventually turned around in 2003 and has grown steadily since. He is also known for founding Blue Origin, a human spaceflight startup and for buyingThe Washington Postfor $250 million cash in 2013.More Jeff BezosTwitterInstagramPet ArticlesRelatedFiona the Baby Hippo of The Cincinnati Zoo is the Official Queen of the SummerHaiku The Husky a Singing Dog Performing Microphone Woos Near YouDolly Parton launches perfectly named dog accessories brand "Doggy Parton"America’s Got Talent Pam and Casper the Singing ChihuahuaTom Hardy writes heartfelt tribute to his dog Woody who just passed awayGiant Tortoise Causes $150,000 Worth of Damage to Neighbors HomeAn otter and two pandas praised for predicting World Cup 2022 match winnersCelebrity couple Beth and Howard Stern uses 90 million dollar fortune to foster hundreds of catsCelebrity PetsRelatedFiona Apple PetsEden Brolin PetsNick Carter PetsCole Hauser PetsAlexander Ovechkin PetsGeorge Russell PetsJermaine Dupri PetsEd Sheeran PetsJimmy Garoppolo PetsNicholas Galitzine PetsSean Hannity PetsForest Whitaker PetsMenuHomeArticlesFeature My PetTerms Of UseAbout UsContact UsDMCAPrivacy PolicyPopular TagsActorsMusiciansAthletesCreatorsComediansDogsCatsBirdsCrittersHorsesTop© 2023 Celebrity Pets / All Rights Reserved.

He was high schoolvaledictorian, aNational Merit Scholar,[34][35]and aSilver Knight Awardwinner in 1982.[34]In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind wouldcolonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park".[36]In 1986, he graduatedsumma cum laudefromPrinceton Universitywith a 4.2GPAand aBachelor of Science in Engineeringdegree (B.S.E.) inelectrical engineeringandcomputer science; he was also a member ofPhi Beta Kappa.[37][38]While at Princeton, Bezos was a member of theQuadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[39]In addition, he was elected toTau Beta Piand was the president of the Princeton chapter of theStudents for the Exploration and Development of Space(SEDS).[40][41]Business careerEarly careerAfter Bezos graduated from college in 1986, he was offered jobs atIntel,Bell Labs, andAndersen Consulting, among others.[42]He first worked at Fitel, afintechtelecommunicationsstart-up, where he was tasked with building a network forinternational trade.[43]Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter. He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager atBankers Trustfrom 1988 to 1990. He then joinedD. E. Shaw & Co, a newly createdhedge fundwith a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling from 1990 until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president by age 30.[44][42]AmazonMain article:AmazonBezos (front row, center) at the Robot Co-op in 2005In late 1993, Bezos read that the Internet was growing at a rate of 2300% a year and decided to establish anonline bookstore.[45]He and his then-wife,MacKenzie Scott, left their jobs at D. E. Shaw and founded Amazon in a rented garage inBellevue, Washington on July 5, 1994, after writing itsbusiness planon a cross-country drive from New York City toSeattle.[46][47]With Bezos at the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company's first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially.[48]Prior to settling on Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at anIndian reservationnearSan Franciscoin order to avoid paying taxes.[49]Bezos initially named his new companyCadabrabut later changed the name toAmazonafter theAmazon Riverin South America, in part because the name begins with the letterA, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[50]At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with "A" would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches.[51]In addition, he regarded "Amazon," the name of the world's largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world's largest online bookstore.[51]He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents as investment in Amazon.[47][52][53]He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[54]Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[44][50]Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with aninitial public offering(IPO).[55]In response to critical reports fromFortuneandBarron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such asBordersandBarnes & Noble.[50]In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company's products to include a variety of otherconsumer goods.[50]Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company's 1997equity offeringto finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[50]In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350 million.[56]In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launchAmazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels andwebsite traffic.[50]In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[57]After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[56]In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400 million.[58][failed verification]In November 2007, Bezos launched theAmazon Kindle.[59]According to a 2008Timeprofile, Bezos wished to create a device that allowed a "flow state" in reading similar to the experience of video games.[60]In 2013, Bezos secured a $600-million contract with theCentral Intelligence Agency(CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[61]In October of that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[62]Bezos in 2010In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[63]On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7 million.[64]A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[65]By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109 billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular,Blue Origin.[66]On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon'sSuper Bowl commercial.[67]On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterlyearningsof $2 billion.[68]Due to the growth ofAlibabain China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon intoIndia.[69]On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became theworld's wealthiest personoverMicrosoftco-founderBill Gateswhen his estimatednet worthincreased to just over $90 billion. His wealth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world byForbeson March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112 billion.[70]Bezos receives theJames Smithson Bicentennialmedal on June 14, 2016, for his work with Amazon.[71]In March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon's global senior vice president, to India with $5.5 billion to localize operations throughout the company'ssupply chainroutes.[72]Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon and Bezos, specifically ofsales taxavoidance, misusingpostal routes, andanti-competitivebusiness practices.[73]Amazon's share price fell by 9% in response to the President's negative comments; this reduced Bezos's personal wealth by $10.7 billion.[74]Weeks later, Bezos recouped his losses when academic reports out ofStanford Universityindicated that Trump could do little to regulate Amazon in any meaningful way.[75]During July 2018, a number of members of the U.S. Congress called on Bezos to detail the applications of Amazon'sface recognitionsoftware,Rekognition.[76]Bezos on October 25, 2017, on his visit toLos Angeles Air Force Base.[77]Criticism of Amazon's business practices continued in September 2018 when SenatorBernie Sandersintroduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receivingcorporate welfare.[78]This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers inArizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers inPennsylvaniaandOhio, relied on food stamps.[79]While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: "Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?"[80]He later said: "Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America."[81]Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary "misleading" as it included part-time workers.[82]However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[83]On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[84]The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour, a decision that was interpreted as support for theFight for $15movement.[85]In February 2021, Bezos announced that in thethird quarterof 2021 he would step down from his role as CEO of Amazon to become the Executive Chairman of the Amazon Board. He was succeeded as CEO byAndy Jassy.[86][87][88]On February 2, 2021, Bezos sent an email[89]to all Amazon employees, telling them the transition would give him "the time and energy [he] need[s] to focus on theDay 1 Fund, theBezos Earth Fund,Blue Origin,The Washington Post, and [his] other passions."[90]Blue OriginMain article:Blue OriginBezos andRob Meyerson(fifth from left) giving NASA Deputy AdministratorLori Garver(fourth from left) a tour of Blue Origin's crew capsule in 2011U.S. Secretary of DefenseAsh Cartermeets with Bezos in 2016 atThe Pentagon.In September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, ahuman spaceflightstartup.[91]Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel and the development of human life in the Solar System.[35]His 1982 high schoolvaledictoriansenior graduation speech was followed up with aMiami Heraldinterview in which he expressed an interest to build and develop hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for human beings who were in orbit.[92]The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse throughresource depletion.[93]Rob Meyersonled Blue Origin from 2003 to 2017 and served as its first president.[94]After its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006 when it purchased a large tract of land inWest Texasfor a launch and test facility.[95]After the company gained the public's attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing thecost of space travelfor humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[96]In September 2011, one of the company's uncrewed prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight. Although the crash was viewed as a setback, news outlets noted how far the company went from its founding-to-date in advancingspaceflight.[97]After the crash, Bezos has been superstitiously wearing his "lucky" TexasCowboy bootsto all rocket launches.[98]In May 2013, Bezos met withRichard Branson, chairman ofVirgin Galactic, to discuss commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies.[99]He has been compared to Branson andElon Muskas all three are billionaires who prioritize spaceflight among their business interests.[100]In 2015, Bezos announced that a neworbital launch vehiclewas under development and would make its first flight in the late-2010s.[101]Later in November, Blue Origin'sNew Shepardspace vehicle successfully rocketed into space and reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers) before executing avertical landingback at the launch site in West Texas. In 2016, Bezos allowed select journalists to visit, tour, and photograph his facility.[102]He has repeatedly called for increased inter-space energy and industrial manufacturing to decrease the negative costs associated withbusiness-related pollution.[103]In December 2017, New Shepard successfully flew and landeddummy passengers, amending and pushing its human space travel start date into late 2018.[104]To execute this program, Blue Origin built six of the vehicles to support all phases of testing and operations: no-passenger test flights, flights with test passengers, and commercial-passenger weekly operations.[105]Since 2016, Bezos has spoken more freely about his hopes tocolonize the solar system, and has been selling US$1 billion in Amazon stock each year to capitalize Blue Origin in an effort to support this endeavor.[106][107]In May 2018, Bezos maintained that the primary goal of Blue Origin is to preserve thenatural resources of Earthby making the human speciesmulti-planetary.[108]He announced thatNew Shepardwould begin transporting humans intosub-orbital spaceby November 2018.[108]In July 2018, it was announced that Bezos had priced commercial spaceflight tickets from $200,000 to $300,000 per person.[109]On July 20, 2021, he launched on theNS-16mission with his half-brother Mark Bezos,Wally Funk, andOliver Daemen.[110]He launched nine days afterRichard Bransonlaunched onboard theVirgin Galactic Unity 22mission.

That $250,000 investment resulted in 3.3 million shares of Google stock, worth about $3.1 billion in 2017.[120][121]He also invested inUnity Biotechnology, a life-extension research firm hoping to slow or stop the process of aging.[122]Bezos is involved in the healthcare sector, which includes investments in Unity Biotechnology,GRAIL,Juno Therapeutics, andZocdoc.[123]In January 2018, an announcement was made concerning Bezos's role within a new, unnamed healthcare company. This venture, later namedHaven, is expected to be a partnership between Amazon,JPMorgan, andBerkshire Hathaway.[124][125]Bezos also supports philanthropic efforts through direct donations and non-profit projects funded by Bezos Expeditions.[126]Bezos used Bezos Expeditions to fund several philanthropic projects, including an Innovation center at the Seattle Museum of History and Industry and the Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics atPrinceton Neuroscience Institute.[127][128]In 2013, Bezos Expeditions funded the recovery of twoSaturn Vfirst-stageRocketdyne F-1engines from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean.[129]They were positively identified as belonging to theApollo 11mission'sS-1C stagefrom July 1969.[130][131]The engines are currently on display at theSeattle Museum of Flight.[132][133]Altos LabsMain article:Altos LabsIn September 2021, Bezos co-founded Altos Labs withMail.rufounderYuri Milner. Altos Labs is a generously funded biotechnology company dedicated to harnessingcellular reprogrammingto developlongevity therapeutics.[7]The company has recruited prominent scientists such asJuan Carlos Izpisúa Belmonte(known for work on rejuvenation through reprogramming),Steve Horvath(known for work inepigenetic aging clocks), andShinya Yamanaka(theNobel Prize-winning inventor of cellular reprogramming in mammalian cells).[7]The company leftstealth modeand launched on January 19, 2022, with a start capital of $3 billion and an executive team led byHal Barron.[134]Public imageBezos at anaturalizationceremony on June 14, 2016JournalistNellie BowlesofThe New York Timeshas described thepublic personaand personality of Bezos as that of "a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan".[135]During the 1990s, Bezos earned a reputation for relentlessly pushing Amazon forward, often at the expense ofpublic charityand social welfare.[135][136]Journalist Mark O'Connell criticized Bezos's relentless customer focus as "very small" in terms of impact on humanity as a whole,[137]a sentiment technologistTim O'Reillyagreed with.[138]His business practices projected a public image ofprudenceand parsimony with his own wealth and that of Amazon. Bezos was a multi-billionaire who drove a 1996Honda Accord.[139]Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[140][141][142]Bezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[143][144]This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman, who described him as "talking in lists" and "[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made."[140]Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrotea bookthat described Bezos as a demanding boss as well ashyper-competitive,[136][143]and opined that Bezos perhaps "bet the biggest on the Internet" than anyone else.[145]Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles andexternalities.[146][147]During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to weartailored clothing; heweight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[148]His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as themetonymof the company.[149][150]His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has beenparodiedas an enterprisingsupervillain.[151][152][153]Since 2017, he has been portrayed byKyle MooneyandSteve CarellonSaturday Night Live, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure.[154][better source needed]In May 2014, theInternational Trade Union Confederationnamed Bezos the "World's Worst Boss", with its general secretarySharan Burrowsaying: "Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model",[155]while in 2019,Harvard Business Review, which ranked Bezos the best-performing CEO for 4 years in a row since 2014, did not rank him even in the top 100, citing Amazon's "relatively low ESG (environment,social, andgovernance) scores" that reflect "risks created byworking conditionsand employment policies,data security, andantitrustissues."[156]During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses.[27]His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016.[157][27]Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing aNew York Timespiece.[158][159]Leadership style"Day 1" Management PhilosophyDay 1:start upDay 2:stasisDay 3:irrelevanceDay 4: "excruciating, painful decline"Day 5:deathBezos has stated "it is always Day 1" to describe hisgrowth mindset.[160][161]Bezos used what he called a "regret-minimization framework" while he worked atD. E. Shawand again during the early years of Amazon. He described thislife philosophyby stating: "When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet?

Bezos' wealth climbed to $75.6 billion on Wednesday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.That tops Buffett's $74.9 billion and $74.2 billion estimated for Amancio Ortega, the founder and controlling shareholder of European clothing company Inditex.Bezos still lags his fellow Seattle-area tech pioneer,Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, whose wealth of $86 billion keeps him in the lead as world's richest person.Helping Bezos get to the No. 2 perch: A rally in Amazon shares to a record. They closed up 2% at $874.32, lifting Amazon's market cap to $422 billion. Bezos owns nearly 17% of Amazon's shares, worth $70 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Barclays Capital on Wednesday started coverage of Amazon with a buy rating and a price target of  $1,120, saying it could be come one of the first $1 trillion dollar market-cap companies.This week Amazon said it would buy Middle East e-commerce retailer Souq.com. According to Bloomberg, it's terminating 263 jobs at its Quidsi unit, which includes Diapers.com and Soap.com, because it had trouble turning a profit.View CommentsFeatured Weekly AdAbout UsNewsroom StaffEthical PrinciplesRequest a CorrectionPress ReleasesAccessibilitySitemapSubscription Terms & ConditionsTerms of ServiceYour California Privacy Rights/Privacy PolicyPrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info/Cookie PolicyContact UsHelp CenterMy AccountGive FeedbackGet Home DeliveryeNewspaperUSA TODAY ShopUSA TODAY Print EditionsLicensing & ReprintsAdvertiseCareersInternshipsSupport Local BusinessNews TipsSubmitting letters to the editorPodcastsNewslettersMobile AppsFacebookTwitterInstagramLinkedInPinterestYouTubeRedditFlipboardRSS10BestReviewedJobsSports WeeklyStudio GannettUSA TODAY Sports+ClassifiedsCouponsBlueprintAuto InsurancePet InsuranceTravel InsuranceCredit CardsBankingPersonal Loans© 2023 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.

                                            Amazon Staff7 minFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedIn ShareEmail ShareWritten byAmazon StaffFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedIn ShareEmail Share“Jeff, what does Day 2 look like?”That’s a question I just got at our most recent all-hands meeting. I’ve been reminding people that it’s Day 1 for a couple of decades. I work in an Amazon building named Day 1, and when I moved buildings, I took the name with me. I spend time thinking about this topic.“Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. Andthatis why it isalwaysDay 1.”To be sure, this kind of decline would happen in extreme slow motion. An established company might harvest Day 2 for decades, but the final result would still come.I’m interested in the question, how do you fend off Day 2? What are the techniques and tactics? How do you keep the vitality of Day 1, even inside a large organization?Such a question can’t have a simple answer. There will be many elements, multiple paths, and many traps. I don’t know the whole answer, but I may know bits of it. Here’s a starter pack of essentials for Day 1 defense: customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends, and high-velocity decision making.True Customer ObsessionThere are many ways to center a business. You can be competitor focused, you can be product focused, you can be technology focused, you can be business model focused, and there are more. But in my view, obsessive customer focus is by far the most protective of Day 1 vitality.Why? There are many advantages to a customer-centric approach, but here’s the big one: customers arealwaysbeautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is great. Even when they don’t yet know it, customers want something better, and your desire to delight customers will drive you to invent on their behalf. No customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime membership program, but it sure turns out they wanted it, and I could give you many such examples.Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when you see customer delight. A customer-obsessed culture best creates the conditions where all of that can happen.Resist ProxiesAs companies get larger and more complex, there’s a tendency to manage to proxies. This comes in many shapes and sizes, and it’s dangerous, subtle, and very Day 2.A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you’re doing the process right. Gulp. It’s not that rare to hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, “Well, we followed the process.” A more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity to investigate and improve the process. The process is not the thing. It’s always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us? In a Day 2 company, you might find it’s the second.Another example: market research and customer surveys can become proxies for customers – something that’s especially dangerous when you’re inventing and designing products. “Fifty-five percent of beta testers report being satisfied with this feature. That is up from 47% in the first survey.” That’s hard to interpret and could unintentionally mislead.Good inventors and designersdeeplyunderstand their customer. They spend tremendous energy developing that intuition. They study and understand many anecdotes rather than only the averages you’ll find on surveys. Theylivewith the design.I’m not against beta testing or surveys. But you, the product or service owner, must understand the customer, have a vision, and love the offering. Then, beta testing and research can help you find your blind spots. A remarkable customer experience starts with heart, intuition, curiosity, play, guts, taste. You won’t find any of it in a survey.Embrace External TrendsThe outside world can push you into Day 2 if you won’t or can’t embrace powerful trends quickly. If you fight them, you’re probably fighting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind.These big trends are not that hard to spot (they get talked and written about a lot), but they can be strangely hard for large organizations to embrace. We’re in the middle of an obvious one right now: machine learning and artificial intelligence.Over the past decades computers have broadly automated tasks that programmers could describe with clear rules and algorithms. Modern machine learning techniques now allow us to do the same for tasks where describing the precise rules is much harder.At Amazon, we’ve been engaged in the practical application of machine learning for many years now. Some of this work is highly visible: our autonomous Prime Air delivery drones; the Amazon Go convenience store that uses machine vision to eliminate checkout lines; and Alexa,1our cloud-based AI assistant. (We still struggle to keep Echo in stock, despite our best efforts. A high-quality problem, but a problem. We’re working on it.)But much of what we do with machine learning happens beneath the surface. Machine learning drives our algorithms for demand forecasting, product search ranking, product and deals recommendations, merchandising placements, fraud detection, translations, and much more. Though less visible, much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type – quietly but meaningfully improving core operations.Inside AWS, we’re excited to lower the costs and barriers to machine learning and AI so organizations of all sizes can take advantage of these advanced techniques.Using our pre-packaged versions of popular deep learning frameworks running on P2 compute instances (optimized for this workload), customers are already developing powerful systems ranging everywhere from early disease detection to increasing crop yields. And we’ve also made Amazon’s higher level services available in a convenient form. Amazon Lex (what’s inside Alexa), Amazon Polly, and Amazon Rekognition remove the heavy lifting from natural language understanding, speech generation, and image analysis. They can be accessed with simple API calls – no machine learning expertise required. Watch this space. Much more to come.High-Velocity Decision MakingDay 2 companies make high-qualitydecisions, but they make high-quality decisionsslowly. To keep the energy and dynamism of Day 1, you have to somehow make high-quality,high-velocitydecisions. Easy for start-ups and very challenging for large organizations. The senior team at Amazon is determined to keep our decision-making velocity high. Speed matters in business – plus a high-velocity decision making environment is more fun too. We don’t know all the answers, but here are some thoughts.First, never use a one-size-fits-all decision-making process. Many decisions are reversible, two-way doors. Those decisions can use a light-weight process. For those, so what if you’re wrong? I wrote about this in more detail in last year’s letter.Second, most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re probably being slow. Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.Third, use the phrase “disagree and commit.” This phrase will save a lot of time. If you have conviction on a particular direction even though there’s no consensus, it’s helpful to say, “Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?” By the time you’re at this point, no one can know the answer for sure, and you’ll probably get a quick yes.This isn’t one way. If you’re the boss, you should do this too. I disagree and commit all the time. We recently greenlit a particular Amazon Studios original. I told the team my view: debatable whether it would be interesting enough, complicated to produce, the business terms aren’t that good, and we have lots of other opportunities. They had a completely different opinion and wanted to go ahead. I wrote back right away with “I disagree and commit and hope it becomes the most watched thing we’ve ever made.” Consider how much slower this decision cycle would have been if the team had actually had toconvinceme rather than simply get my commitment.Note what this example is not: it’s not me thinking to myself “well, these guys are wrong and missing the point, but this isn’t worth me chasing.” It’s a genuine disagreement of opinion, a candid expression of my view, a chance for the team to weigh my view, and a quick, sincere commitment to go their way. And given that this team has already brought home 11 Emmys, 6 Golden Globes, and 3 Oscars, I’m just glad they let me in the room at all!Fourth, recognize truemisalignmentissues early and escalate themimmediately. Sometimes teams have different objectives and fundamentally different views. They are not aligned. No amount of discussion, no number of meetings will resolve that deep misalignment. Without escalation, the default dispute resolution mechanism for this scenario is exhaustion. Whoever has more stamina carries the decision.I’ve seen many examples of sincere misalignment at Amazon over the years. When we decided to invite third party sellers to compete directly against us on our own product detail pages – that was a big one. Many smart, well-intentioned Amazonians were simply not at all aligned with the direction. The big decision set up hundreds of smaller decisions, many of which needed to be escalated to the senior team.“You’ve worn me down” is an awful decision-making process. It’s slow and de-energizing. Go for quick escalation instead – it’s better.So, have you settled only for decision quality, or are you mindful of decision velocity too? Are the world’s trends tailwinds for you? Are you falling prey to proxies, or do they serve you? And most important of all, are you delighting customers? We can have the scope and capabilities of a large company and the spirit and heart of a small one. But we have to choose it.A huge thank you to each and every customer for allowing us to serve you, to our shareowners for your support, and to Amazonians everywhere for your hard work, your ingenuity, and your passion.As always,I attach a copy of our original 1997 letter. It remains Day 1.Sincerely,JeffJeffrey P.

While Amazon and Bezos are household names with his various other business endeavors, including sending William Shatner and Michael Strahan to space on his sub-orbital spaceflight service,Blue Origin, the former Amazon CEO came from humble beginnings.In fact, Bezos' father, Miguel Bezos, migrated to the United States from Cuba, which had a great impact on his son's entrepreneurial drive. Working with the Statue of Liberty Ellis Island Foundation, Bezos honored his dad at the 2022 Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Awards, explaining, "He spoke no English, he had to make his way," at the event. "He had those tough experiences. I think in every immigrant you'll find a deep optimism and a deep resilience too."View this post on InstagramA post shared by Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island (@statueellisfdn)As the child of an immigrant, Bezos' rise to success is a true American dream.Keep scrolling for more details on how Bezos made Amazon what it is today.How did Jeff Bezos start Amazon?In 1994, formerAmazon CEO Jeff Bezoswas already extremely successful by most peoples standards. The youngest-ever senior vice president at Wall Street investment bankDE Shaw & Co., the then 30-year-oldPrinceton Universitygraduate was already making an estimated six-figure salary and was destined to rise even further in the company ranks. But Bezos had other plans.Fueled by a secret passion for the infant business of electronic retailing, Bezos dreamed of creating his own company in the vast, then virtually uncharted wilds of the World Wide Web. It was a risky move, but it quickly paid off. Just four years after Bezos created Amazon.com, the virtual bookstore became the template for how e-commerce businesses should be run, with sales of more than $610 million and more than 13 million customers worldwide.Bezos first got the idea to start an Internet enterprise in 1994. While surfing the Internet in search of new ventures for D E Shaw to invest in, he came across the statistic that World Wide Web usage was growing by 2,300 percent a month. Bezos immediately recognized the expansive possibilities of selling online and began exploring the entrepreneurial possibilities of developing an Internet business.He drew up a list of 20 potential products he thought might sell well via the Internet, including software, CDs and books. After reviewing the list, books were the obvious choice, primarily because of the sheer number of titles in existence. Bezos realized that while even the largest superstores could stock only a few hundred thousand books, a mere fraction of what is available, a "virtual" bookstore could offer millions of titles. The die was cast. Bezos passed up a fat bonus, packed his wife,MacKenzie Bezos, and their dog, Kamala (named after an obscure "Star Trek" character), and headed for Seattle.For Bezos, Seattle was the ideal city for his new business. Not only was it home to a tremendous pool of high-tech talent, it was also in close proximity to Ingram Book Group's Oregon warehouse. While MacKenzie drove, Jeff spent the trip pecking out a business plan on a laptop computer and calling prospective investors on a cell phone. With $1 million raised from family and friends, Bezos rented a house in Seattle and set up his business in the garage.For nearly a year, Bezos and a crew of five employees worked out of the garage, learning how to source books and setting up a computer system that would makeAmazon.comeasy to navigate. A true marketing visionary, in addition to creating a user-friendly interface that would streamline the "needle in a haystack" process that bookstore shopping often entails, Bezos wanted to establish a "virtual community" where visitors could "hang out." To achieve this goal, he and his team created a number of innovative programs, including one that would let customers add their own book reviews to the site and a feature that recommends books based on a customer's previous purchases.In July 1995, Amazon.com opened its virtual doors, calling itself "Earth's Biggest Book Store," with more than 1 million titles to choose from. Fueled by word of mouth, or more accurately, word of e-mail, Amazon.com rocketed off the line like a nitro-burning dragster. Enraptured by the enormous selection of books, the superior customer service and the user-friendly design of the site, Internet users ecstatically plugged Amazon.com on Internet newsgroups and mailing lists.The orders poured in, and by September 1996, Amazon.com had grown into a company of 100 employees and had racked up more than $15.7 million in sales. Three years later, those figures would rocket to more than 3,000 employees (including some in Britain and Germany) and more than $610 million in sales.Amazon's success did not go unnoticed by bookstore giant Barnes & Noble, who quickly put up its own website. To combat Amazon's claim that it was "Earth's Biggest Bookstore," Barnes & Noble embarked on an aggressive marketing campaign proclaiming that they offered twice as many books as Amazon. But it was a strategy doomed to failure. The forward-thinking Bezos had already expanded Amazon's product line to include CDs and replaced "Earth's Biggest Book Store" with the tagline "Books, Music and More," leaving Barnes & Noble, as one writer put it, "wrapping its fingers around the neck of a phantom."While Amazon has left its closest competitor in the dust, the company set its sights on conquering all of online retail. In 2019, it was believed that Amazon controlled 37% of all online retail sales, thanks to the company's relentless expansion and acquisition strategy. In late January 1999, Amazon went after the $150 billion U.S. pharmacy market, buying a share of Drugstore.com, a company that sells everything from breath mints to Viagra online. They have since deepened their footprint in the healthcare world. In 2018, Amazon acquired PillPack, an online full-service pharmacy. Plus, in addition to Amazon's continual expansion, Bezos also launchedAmazon Web Servicesproviding on-demand cloud computing platforms, and he ownsThe Washington Postamong many other business endeavors.How much of Amazon does Jeff Bezos own?Previously owning 16 percent of the company, the Amazon employee sold $8.8 billion worth of his Amazon stock after stepping back as Amazon CEO to become executive chairman in July 2021. Despite owning less than 10 percent of the company today, his net worth is estimates to be a whopping $171 billion, per Forbes.Prior to leaving his position as CEO, Bezos went through a very public divorce with his now ex-wife MacKenzie Scott in 2019. After 25 years of marriage, MacKenzie received 4 percent of Amazon in the settlement valued at $38 billion. Since their split, MacKenzie went on to marry Seattle school teacher Dan Jewett in March 2021, while the Amazon founder has been dating girlfriend Lauren Sanchez since 2019.What is Jeff Bezos doing now?Now with more time on his hands, Bezos is of course philanthropic thanks to hisBezos Family Foundation, however, he's still very much embroiled in the criticism wealthy corporations like his garner on the issue of corporate taxes.In fact, president Joe Biden slammed organizations like his via Twitter as tensions around inflation rise. "You want to bring down inflation? Let's make sure the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share," President Biden tweeted on May 13, 2022, to which Bezos replied, "Raising corp taxes is fine to discuss. Taming inflation is critical to discuss. Mushing them together is just misdirection."The newly created Disinformation Board should review this tweet, or maybe they need to form a new Non Sequitur Board instead. Raising corp taxes is fine to discuss. Taming inflation is critical to discuss. Mushing them together is just misdirection.https://t.co/ye4XiNNc2v— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos)May 14, 2022Although Amazon didn't pay federal income tax in 2017 and 2018, Bezos doesn't think big business are to blame for inflation. "They know inflation hurts the neediest the most. But unions aren't causing inflation and neither are wealthy people," Bezos added in response to the White House and Biden administration.Entrepreneur Editors' PicksZooey DeschanelEmbraces the Word 'Quirky'and Thinks Businesses Should TooASimple (But Not Easy) Guideto Achieving Almost Any DreamMaking Time to Be 'Useless'Is a Vital Part of CreatingAnything ValuableA Billionaire Who Operates More Than 2,400 Franchises KnowsThese Types of FranchiseesMake the Most MoneyHowRelentless OptimismFuels Success for Hilary Schneider, CEO of ShutterflyThe Paradox ofCelebrity TequilaSocial Media Was Draining Me, SoI Gave It Up.My Business Has Never Been Stronger.Free Guidebook: How to Buy the Right Franchise For YouDiscover tips and advice straight from the pros about finding your ideal franchise that matches your interests, goals, and financial needs in our Entrepreneur Insights guidebook.

So, who are the parents of the boy who would become the wealthiest person on earth? Here’s what we know.Jeff Bezos was born in New Mexico on January 12, 1964. Photo: @jeffbezos/InstagramJeff Bezos’ biological parents were teenagers when they had himThe Amazon founder was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1964. His biological parents, Jacklyn Gise and Ted Jorgensen, were only 17 and 18 years old respectively, according to Business Insider. At the time of his birth, Bezos’ mum was still a high school student and his dad performed in a circus.Jeff Bezos’ mum Jacklyn Gise had her son at 17. Photo: @JeffBezos/TwitterPer Grandcelebs, although her school initially tried to prevent her from graduating, the mother of the future billionaire refused to give up. The school eventually permitted her to finish her studies under specific conditions, such as not being able to talk to other students or have lunch in the cafeteria. Gise complied with the rules and even attended night classes where she could bring baby Bezos with her.Jeff Bezos’ parents, Jacklyn Gise and Miguel Bezos. Photo: @statueellisfdn/InstagramHowever, before Jeff was 18 months old, his parents divorced. A few years later, Jacklyn met Miguel Bezos while attending night school, according to CNBC, and in 1968 the couple married, with Miguel adopting the future tech billionaire.In a 2014 Inside Edition interview, Jeff’s biological dad recounted the last time he saw his toddler son: “I was working in a Walmart and I remember them coming to visit me for some reason.” Jeff was only about three years old and the two never saw each other in person again. At the time of the interview, Jorgensen was a bike shop owner who didn’t know Jeff was his son until biographers contacted him. He passed away in 2015.Jeff Bezos was embraced with open arms by his stepfather Miguel Bezos. Photo: @JeffBezos/TwitterThe name Bezos comes from his stepfather, who had fled Communist CubaAfter Jacklyn and Miguel wed, the family moved to Houston, Texas and Miguel adopted Jeff, passing on his last name.

Photo: @JeffBezos/TwitterSpeaking at the event, an emotional Jeff praised his immigrant father as an exemplary role model: “They [immigrants] also end up having a belief in America. They think this place creates opportunity and it does. That’s certainly the story of my dad. He came from Santiago, Cuba.”He went on to talk about how his dad was only 16 when he arrived and spoke no English: “He had to make his way. He had those tough experiences. I think in every immigrant you’ll find a deep optimism and a deep resilience too. My dad is an intense hard worker. My dad is warm and he teaches an easy smile. My brother and sister and I could not have had a better role model.”Jeff Bezos showed entrepreneurial spirit from a young age.

Besides simply raising the world’s first centibillionaire-in-the-making, Jacklyn and Mike were financially instrumental in Jeff’s success. As reported by British tabloids, in the mid 1990s Jeff approached his parents with a proposal to invest in his new internet business venture.Jeff Bezos with his mother Jacklyn, who raised him as a teen parent.

Though the investment came with a great deal of risk, Bezos was clear and upfront with his parents about this. As per CNBC, Jeff admitted that there was as much as a 70 per cent chance that they might never get their money back.The Bezos family.

By 1999 already, according to CNBC, Bezos had built an estimated net worth of around US$9 billion.Jeff Bezos’ dad Miguel, aka Mike, chipped in over US$200,000 to invest in Amazon during its early stages, and it paid off very well. Photo: @jeffbezos/InstagramAlthough the amount of Amazon stock Jeff’s parents hold is unclear, in 2018 Bloomberg estimated that, thanks to their investment, the couple alone could be worth US$30 billion, by now likely much more. That indicates the parents’ return on their investment was around an incredible 12 million per cent.Dr Nicole Martin and her partner Anthony Lopez star in Real Housewives of Miami.

He built an online bookseller into e-commerce giant Amazon, with a current market cap of nearly$947 billion. It took hard work and ingenuity, but it also takes something else to be successful, according to Bezos: luck."I feel very strongly that I've won a lot of lotteries," Bezos said at theBush Center's Forum on Leadershipin 2018."Amazon is one of the lotteries I won."Another? Having a great support system."I think one of the precursors of being able to take risk is to have some kind of support from somebody," he said. "You have to have some mentors, you have to have somebody that loves you. These are the kind of things that build up and allow you to jump off into uncharted terrain and do something new, because you know you have a support system."In Bezos' case, he said, "I had a big lottery with my parents."Despite being a divorced, teenage mom, Bezos' mother Jackie "made it work." "Her parents, my grandparents, helped her and made that all work," Bezos said at the Bush Center in 2018. Mike Bezos, the man who raised him (Bezos' biological father left when he was a baby), is "a great guy," Bezos said. "My dad is a Cuban immigrant. He came here when he was16 years old. He didn't speak any English."And Bezos' parents believed in their son. Theyinvested$245,573 in Amazon in 1995, according to a1997 prospectus."If you don't get that kind of support somehow – it doesn't have to be your parents, sometimes people get lucky and it's the grandparent, or a friend, or a family friend, or a teacher. But you need that. Somebody has to step into your life."Bezos isn't the only billionaire who acknowledges the role luck plays in success.Mark Zuckerberg has said his family's financial and other support is abig part of what allowed him to found Facebook."The greatest successes come from having the freedom to fail," Zuckerberg said in aHarvard Universitycommencement speech in 2017. "If ... I didn't know I'd be fine ifFacebookdidn't work out, I wouldn't be standing here today.""If we're honest, we all know how much luck we've had," he said.And Warren Buffett often says he won the"ovarian lottery.""The womb from which you emerge determines your fate to an enormous degree for most of the seven billion people in the world," Buffett toldjournalist Rebecca Jarvis in 2013.Buffett said that he and Charlie Munger were born "wired in a certain way," at the 1997 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting, "which we had nothing to do with, [and] that happens to enable us to be good at valuing businesses.""And, you know, is that the greatest talent in the world? No. It just happens to be something that pays off like crazy in this system."Check out:The best credit cards of 2021could earn you over $1,000 in 5 yearsDon't miss:From Jeff Bezos to Mark Cuban: What some of the world's richest billionaires studied in collegeJeff Bezos looks for these 3 traits when hiring at AmazonAt age 30, Jeff Bezos thought this would be his one big regret in lifeVIDEO0:4700:47Jeff Bezos donated $33 million to pay 'dreamers'' tuitionMake ItStay in the loopGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inboxSign UpAbout UsLearn more about the world of CNBC Make ItLearn MoreFollow UsCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel©2023CNBC LLC.

It's like a cruise more than it's like a job in that aspect.Amazon (just as famously) doesn't offer similar perks like free food and massages.Bezos minimized the importance of those perks for attracting top talent. He said that if you were to give job advice to your niece, would you tell her to go find the company with the best massages?Of course not, you would go find the most interesting work.However, Bezos also said he rejects the idea that Amazon doesn't take care of its employees: "We have great amenities, they're just not the same as what some other companies do."What are those amenities?He said Amazon is in the heart of Seattle, which means employees can live in a great city, and walk to work. There are good food carts that show up at Amazon's headquarters that provide a variety of food (that employees have to pay for).You can open the windows in the office, which is actually harder than you think to make happen, says Bezos. He had to fight the HVAC people on it. They would say, "What if someone leaves it open when it's raining?" Bezos' response: "What if they put bugs in our code? At least, we can see the open windows!"Amazon also allows people to bring dogs to the office, which is a nice, comforting thing for employees.These may not sound as fantastic as the perks offered by Amazon's rivals, but the bottom line to Bezos is that Amazon offers amenities, and most important satisfying work.Sign up for notifications from Insider!

Today, Amazon is an ecommerce behemoth worth $1.8 trillion, and that company has made him the richest person in the world with a fortune worth over$200 billion.Over Bezos' roughly 27 years as CEO, he's regularly shared advice and lessons learned in interviews and his annual letters to Amazon shareholders.Here are some of the best examples of what Bezos, 57, has shared over the years.Take risks"When you think about the things that you will regret when you're 80, they're almost always the things that you did not do. They're acts of omission. Very rarely are you going to regret something that you did that failed and didn't work or whatever," Bezos said in a2018 interview.That philosophy helped shape Bezos' life before he even launched Amazon. When he was just 30 years old, Bezos had a Wall Street job at hedge fund D. E. Shaw, but he saw promise in the future of the internet economy and got the idea to build a bookstore online. Bezos' boss agreed the idea had potential, but he still tried to convince Bezos that it would be less of a risk to keep the job he had."I pictured myself [at] 80 years old, thinking back on my life in a quiet moment of reflection," Bezos said of that moment in his life during a2020 fireside chat in India. "Would I regret leaving this company in the middle of the year? And walking away from my annual bonus?"Of course, Bezos decided to go for it, and he moved across the country to start Amazon out ofa garage in the Seattle suburbsin the summer of 1994. The website went live a year later, onJuly 16, 1995."I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing. And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all,"Bezos saidin 2018. So he "took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice."Picturing yourself as an 80-year-old looking back on your life and the choices you might regret also works for personal decisions, Bezos added."I'm not just talking about business things," he said. "It's like, 'I love that person and I never told them,' and you know, 50 years later you're like, 'Why didn't I tell her? Why didn't I go after it?'"So that's the kind of life regret that is very hard to be happy about when you're telling yourself, in a private moment, that story of your life."VIDEO15:1615:16How I built Blavity, a media empire for Black millennialsMake ItMake good decisions — fastBezos believesthat the key to maintaining an innovative business is to make "high-quality,high-velocitydecisions."In his2015 letter to Amazon shareholders, Bezos wrote about the importance of speed and "nimbleness" in making Amazon "a large company that's also an invention machine." While he admits that some decisions are "irreversible or nearly irreversible," most are not."Most decisions ... are changeable, reversible – they're two-way doors," he wrote. In those cases, when you make a decision that is "suboptimal," according to Bezos, "you don't have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through."Those types of decisions should be made "quickly," according to Bezos. Otherwise, he wrote, people or companies that spend too much time deliberating over reversible decisions risk being subject to "slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention.""All of my best decisions in business and in life have been made with heart, intuition, guts — not [with] analysis,"Bezos saidin an interview at the Economic Club Washington D.C. in 2018.Finding your callingFiguring out your passion in life is a central point in the advice that Bezos says he most often gives to his younger employees, as well as his four children, the billionairesaidat the George W. Bush Presidential Center's Forum on Leadership in 2018."You can have a job, or you can have a career, or you can have a calling," Bezos said. "And if you can somehow figure out how to have a calling, you have hit the jackpot, because that's the big deal."In other words, finding a way to make a career out of your passion is Bezos' idea of true success. And, he believes that everyone has a passion."You don't choose your passions, your passions choose you," he said at the time. "All of us are gifted with certain passions, and the people who are lucky are the ones who get to follow those things."While Bezos has said he followed his passion as a "garage inventor" when he launched Amazon, in recent years the billionaire admitted that his real lifelong passion has been space."Ever since I was 5 years old — that's when Neil Armstrong stepped onto the surface of the moon — I've been passionate about space, rockets, rocket engines, space travel,"he saidin 2019. (Bezos' high school graduation speecheven mentioned his plans to one day build space colonies.)Bezos hasspent billions of dollarsfunding his space company, Blue Origin, and one of his first orders of business after stepping down as Amazon CEO will be to fly on the company'sfirst passenger spaceflightwith his brother on July 20.Embrace the inefficiency of wanderingIn his2018 letter to Amazon shareholders, Bezos included a section titled, "Intuition, curiosity, and the power of wandering." In that section, the Amazon CEO wrote about the importance of setting aside time to explore your curiosity in order to come up with new, innovative solutions to challenges.Amazon's business may depend on efficiency, with customers ordering almost any product and expecting it delivered to their door within a few days or less. But, Bezos believes thata healthy dose of inefficiencyis necessary to succeed. In the letter, he describes this as "wandering," or exploring and experimenting even if it means taking a roundabout path to a solution."Wandering is an essential counter-balance to efficiency," he said. "You need to employ both.""Sometimes (often actually) in business, you do know where you're going, and when you do, you can be efficient. Put in place a plan and execute," Bezos wrote in the letter."In contrast, wandering in business is not efficient … but it's also not random," he continued. "It's guided — by hunch, gut, intuition, curiosity, and powered by a deep conviction that the prize for customers is big enough that it's worth being a little messy and tangential to find our way there."According to Bezos, one of the lessons he'd learned building Amazon was "that success can come through iteration: invent, launch, reinvent, relaunch, start over, rinse, repeat, again and again," he wrote, adding that "the path to success is anything but straight."Don't lose your distinctivenessIn April, in hisfinal letter to shareholdersas Amazon's CEO,Bezos wroteabout the importance of holding onto your "originality.""We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable," Bezos wrote. "We are all taught to 'be yourself.' What I'm really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways, it pulls at you. Don't let it happen."Bezos went on to say that "it's worth it" to maintain your distinctiveness, even though it requires "continuous hard work.""The fairy tale version of [the advice] 'be yourself' is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don't expect it to be easy or free," Bezos wrote.Since stepping down as CEO, Bezos transitioned to be executive chairman of Amazon's board and has said he is moving on to focus on projects like Blue Origin. On Tuesday, July 20,Bezos will even make his first trip to spaceaboard Blue Origin's first-ever passenger spaceflight.Sign up now:Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss:Jeff Bezos steps down as Amazon CEO — look inside the Seattle house where he started the companyValedictorian Jeff Bezos said he wanted to build 'space hotels and colonies' in his 1982 high school graduation speechVIDEO12:0612:06Why more men are becoming stay-at-home dadsMake ItStay in the loopGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inboxSign UpAbout UsLearn more about the world of CNBC Make ItLearn MoreFollow UsCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel©2023CNBC LLC.

And still the same great burger. Happy Sunday!"—Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos)August 28, 2022Bezos started flipping burgers in 1980 in a McDonald's restaurant at the age of 16."I was a grill man and never worked the cash registers. The most challenging thing was keeping everything going at the right pace during a rush," he told Cody Teets for her book "Golden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers That Began at McDonald's."Bezos added: "The manager at my McDonald's was excellent. He had a lot of teenagers working for him, and he kept us focused even while we had fun."Bezos reportedly studied the fast-food chain's workflow technology and brainstormed improvements while working in the kitchen,Wired has reported.Despite his continued love of McDonald's burgers, there are some things that set the Amazon founder apart from most of the chain's customers.Earlier this year he came under fire for seeking to temporarilydismantle a historic bridgein Rotterdam so his new 417-foot megayacht could leave the shipyard where it was being constructed after being completed.The bridge, known as De Hef, is nearly 100 years old, and while it is no longer used has become a much-admired monument in the Dutch city.The yacht, known as Y721 and estimated to cost about $500 million,quietly left the Dutch shipyardbefore being finished without the bridge being dismantled.Sign up for notifications from Insider!

His mother Jacklyn, who became became pregnant with Bezosat 16, remembers his fascination with discovering the way machines and toys worked."I knew early on that he was wired a little bit differently,"she says."When he tried to take his crib apart with a screwdriver, I think that cinched it."tweetSo when 16-year-old Jeff got a summer job frying up burgers at McDonald's in 1980, he learned all he could from the experience.Jeff Bezos | Instagram"I was a cook,"Bezos told Fast Company. "They wouldn't let me anywhere near the customers. This was my acned-teenager stage. They were like, 'Hmm, why don't you work in the back?'" he joked.As a "grill man," the most challenging thing for Bezos "was keeping everything going at the right pace during a rush," he told Cody Teets, author of "Golden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers That Began at McDonald's."The experience was Bezos' first hands-on brush with retail,according to Wired, and he spent the summer "studying the company's automation improvements," like beeps and signals for when to "scramble his eggs, flip his burgers, and pull his fries out of the boiling vat."The job also gave him early insight into customer service: "I learned that it's really hard," he told Fast Company. Today, "customer obsession" is the first one of Amazon's leadership principles.Bezos isn't the only entrepreneur to glean lessons from working at a fast-food chain. Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian wasa waiter at Pizza Hut in high school, after working his way up from a dishwasher.As a waiter, "I learned basically everything I've ever needed to know about customer service," Ohanian toldThe New York Times.Barbara Corcoran, star of ABC's "Shark Tank, found similar value working as a waitress in her early 20s."You learn more in waitressing than you can in any other job," Corcorantells CNBC Make It."The best job you could have to prepare for entrepreneurship is, walk on the other side of the counter and serve people."As for Bezos's time at McDonald's, his advice for young people is to always keep your eyes open for lessons to learn at any gig, even it's just flipping burgers."You can learn responsibility in any job, if you take it seriously," he said in "Golden Opportunity.""You learn a lot as a teenager working at McDonald's," he said. "It's different from what you learn in school.

      head cheerleader forAmazon.com, the Internet bookselling company he founded in 1995. With about $1
      million in capital, most borrowed from friends and family, Bezos built a
      multibillion-dollar empire in about five years and in doing so,
      revolutionized the way commerce is done on the Internet.Childhood YearsJeffrey Preston Bezos was born January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New
      Mexico. A year later, his parents divorced and since then he has never had
      contact with his biological father. Three years later, his mother, Jackie
      Gise, married Michael Bezos, who fled his native Cuba when he was fifteen
      years old."In early 1996 we were called Amazon.con, in '97
        Amazon.toast, and in 1999 it was Amazon.bomb. Then there was my personal
        favorite:Amazon.org, because clearly we're not for profit.… It still gets a
        ton of attention. I mean, you're still talking to me."Much of Jeff Bezos's relentless drive and ambition likely came from
      his new father, who was raised in a Catholic mission. Mike Bezos always
      strove to better himself, learning English 
       and working various odd jobs to pay for his education at the University
      of New Mexico at Albuquerque. After college, he became an engineer with
      Exxon Corporation, causing the family to move to Texas. After several
      years, another job transfer brought them to Florida, where Jeff Bezos
      attended Palmetto High School in Miami. Bezos was popular in school and
      became class president and valedictorian in his senior year.Early InnovatorBezos always had a knack for figuring out how things work. InJeff Bezos: King of Amazon,author Josepha Sherman writes, "From the time he was a toddler,
      Bezos was busy trying to change his world. He felt he was too old to sleep
      in a 'baby' crib, so he found a screwdriver and took the
      crib apart. Instead of getting mad, Bezos's family encouraged
      him."Bezos had a younger sister, Christina, and brother, Mark. When the young
      siblings learned to walk, they loved going into their brother's
      room because of all the fascinating "toys". To warn him that
      the children were coming, Jeff attached an alarm to his bedroom door that
      made a loud buzzing sound when someone entered.When Bezos was twelve he wanted something called an Infinity Cube. The
      device was a set of small motorized mirrors that reflected off one another
      so the images seemed to go on endlessly. It cost $20 but Bezos did not
      have enough money to buy it. Instead, he purchased mirrors and other parts
      with what money he had and constructed his own reflecting cube. He built
      other inventions, including amateur robots. At one point he had so much
      clutter in his bedroom, his parents made him move all of his half-finished
      devices and experiments into the garage.There are many similar stories surrounding Bezos's childhood years.
      He spent countless hours building models and an assortment of electronics
      kits. He worked on science projects, often coming up with his own
      "inventions." By the time he reached high school, he had
      turned the family garage into his personal science and electronics
      laboratory. Ironically, Bezos later would launchAmazon.comfrom his own garage.Enters PrincetonAfter graduating with honors from high school, Bezos decided to follow in
      the footsteps of Stephen Hawking and enroll in the physics program at
      Princeton University. He soon realized, however, that the subject was too
      difficult for him, so he switched to a double major in electronics and
      computer science. Bezos discovered he excelled at creating software
      programs. In 1986, he graduated with highest honors and Phi Beta Kappa
      (membership in a national honor society), earning degrees in electrical
      engineering and the still new field of computer science.Bezos turned down several job offers from large corporations and instead
      took a position with a newly formed fiber optic company, Fitel. His task
      was to help the company build a computer network specifically for
      international finance. In 1988, he took a job developing systems for
      managing investment funds at Banker's Trust in New York City. After
      two years, he moved to the Wall Street investment firm of D. E. Shaw
      & Company as a computer specialist. In 1992, at age twenty-eight,
      he became Shaw's youngest ever vice president; two years later he
      was promoted to senior vice president.Bezos and DisneyAt various times, Jeff Bezos dreamed of becoming a cowboy or an
        astronaut. He was a devotedStar Trekfan and went as far as naming his dog Kamala after a minor character
        from an episode ofStar Trek: The Next Generation.His heroesincluded American inventor Thomas Edison(1847-1931), astrophysicist Stephen Hawking (1942-), andWalt Disney(see entry), although he was no Mickey Mouse fan. Instead, he was
        fascinated with how Disney came up with the electronics and animatronics
        used in Disney World in Orlando, Florida."The thing that always amazed me [about Disney] was how powerful
        his vision was," Bezos said in aTimearticle. "He knew exactly what he wanted to build and teamed up
        with a bunch of really smart people and built it. Everyone thought it
        wouldn't work, and he had to persuade the banks to lend him $400
        million. But he did it." Many friendsandfamily members would likely say the same thing about Bezos and the way
        he tookAmazon.comfrom an idea to a multibillion-dollar enterprise. Bezos, however, did
        it much quicker than Disney.From Idea to RealityWhile at Shaw Bezos developed the idea that would eventually becomeAmazon.com. In 1994, he read an article about how the World Wide Web was growing by
      2,300 percent a year. He knew he had to tap into such a great potential
      for commerce but was unsure what type of business would work 
       best. He researched mail-order companies, believing their products would
      sell well on the Internet. After drawing up a list of twenty popular
      mail-order items, Bezos finally settled on books since the millions of
      titles in print offered an enormous potential for sales.On July 6,1995, Bezos launchedAmazon.com, named after the South American river, with financial and moral support
      from family and friends. The company operated out of the garage of the
      Bezos's two-bedroom home in suburban Seattle, Washington. With
      almost no publicity, sales took off immediately. "Within the first
      few days, I knew this was going to be huge," Bezos toldTime."It was obvious that we were onto something much bigger than we
      ever dared to hope."Person of the YearBy the end of 1999,Amazon.comhad become a multibillion-dollar corporation offering 3.5 million titles
      for sale. It had expanded into a variety of other merchandise, including
      music and videos, and had set up operations in Europe. Bezos's
      personal fortune alone was estimated at $10.5 billion. In the crowning
      achievement of his career,Timemagazine named Bezos its "Person of the Year" for 1999,
      proclaiming him king of cybercommerce.With success came adversity. The company became involved in several
      notable lawsuits filed by Barnes & Noble and Wal-Mart. But none of
      the problems compared to the biggest challenge of all: making the company
      profitable.Amazon.comlost money every year, including $1.4 billion in 2000. In 2001, the
      company laid off thirteen hundred workers and instituted other
      cost-cutting measures. The belt-tightening worked andAmazon.composted its first ever net profit of $5.1 million for the fourth quarter
      of 2001.Despite his hectic schedule, the head of the world's largest
        bookstore still finds time to read. Jeff Bezos buys about ten books a
        month although he reads only three. His favorites includeThe Remains of the Dayby Kazuo Ishiguro,Duneby Frank Herbert, andBuilt to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companiesby James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras.For the future, Bezos plans to makeAmazon.coma place people can buy anything they want on-line. And now that theCEO and founder Jeff Bezos is known for his sunny disposition and
            booming laugh.Reproduced by permission of the Corbis Corporation (Bellevue).company is firmly rooted, Bezos and his wife MacKenzie want to turn their
      attention to charitable work. "At some point, we want to figure out
      how to do philanthropic work that's highly leveraged," said
      Bezos. "It's very easy to give away money ineffectively. But
      doing it well requires at least as much attention and energy as building a
      successful company."For Further InformationBooksSaunders, Rebecca.Business theAmazon.comWay.London: Capstone Ltd., 1999.Sherman, Josepha.Jeff Bezos: King of Amazon.Brookfield, CT: Twenty-First Century Books, 2001.Spector, Robert.Amazon.com—Get Big Fast: Inside the Revolutionary Business Model That Changed the

He was high schoolvaledictorian, aNational Merit Scholar,[34][35]and aSilver Knight Awardwinner in 1982.[34]In his graduation speech, Bezos told the audience he dreamed of the day when mankind wouldcolonize space. A local newspaper quoted his intention "to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park".[36]In 1986, he graduatedsumma cum laudefromPrinceton Universitywith a 4.2GPAand aBachelor of Science in Engineeringdegree (B.S.E.) inelectrical engineeringandcomputer science; he was also a member ofPhi Beta Kappa.[37][38]While at Princeton, Bezos was a member of theQuadrangle Club, one of Princeton's 11 eating clubs.[39]In addition, he was elected toTau Beta Piand was the president of the Princeton chapter of theStudents for the Exploration and Development of Space(SEDS).[40][41]Business careerEarly careerAfter Bezos graduated from college in 1986, he was offered jobs atIntel,Bell Labs, andAndersen Consulting, among others.[42]He first worked at Fitel, afintechtelecommunicationsstart-up, where he was tasked with building a network forinternational trade.[43]Bezos was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter. He transitioned into the banking industry when he became a product manager atBankers Trustfrom 1988 to 1990. He then joinedD. E. Shaw & Co, a newly createdhedge fundwith a strong emphasis on mathematical modelling from 1990 until 1994. Bezos became D. E. Shaw's fourth senior vice-president by age 30.[44][42]AmazonMain article:AmazonBezos (front row, center) at the Robot Co-op in 2005In late 1993, Bezos read that the Internet was growing at a rate of 2300% a year and decided to establish anonline bookstore.[45]He and his then-wife,MacKenzie Scott, left their jobs at D. E. Shaw and founded Amazon in a rented garage inBellevue, Washington on July 5, 1994, after writing itsbusiness planon a cross-country drive from New York City toSeattle.[46][47]With Bezos at the helm and Scott taking an integral role in its operation—writing checks, keeping track of the books, and negotiating the company's first freight contracts—the foundation was laid for this garage-run operation to grow exponentially.[48]Prior to settling on Seattle, Bezos had investigated setting up his company at anIndian reservationnearSan Franciscoin order to avoid paying taxes.[49]Bezos initially named his new companyCadabrabut later changed the name toAmazonafter theAmazon Riverin South America, in part because the name begins with the letterA, which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[50]At the time, website listings were alphabetized, so a name starting with "A" would appear sooner when customers conducted online searches.[51]In addition, he regarded "Amazon," the name of the world's largest river as fitting for what he hoped would become the world's largest online bookstore.[51]He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents as investment in Amazon.[47][52][53]He warned many early investors that there was a 70% chance that Amazon would fail or go bankrupt.[54]Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[44][50]Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he took it public with aninitial public offering(IPO).[55]In response to critical reports fromFortuneandBarron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake competition from larger book retailers such asBordersandBarnes & Noble.[50]In 1998, Bezos diversified into the online sale of music and video, and by the end of the year he had expanded the company's products to include a variety of otherconsumer goods.[50]Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company's 1997equity offeringto finance aggressive acquisition of smaller competitors.[50]In 2000, Bezos borrowed $2 billion from banks, as its cash balances dipped to only $350 million.[56]In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launchAmazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels andwebsite traffic.[50]In late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress when revenues stagnated.[57]After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[56]In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400 million.[58][failed verification]In November 2007, Bezos launched theAmazon Kindle.[59]According to a 2008Timeprofile, Bezos wished to create a device that allowed a "flow state" in reading similar to the experience of video games.[60]In 2013, Bezos secured a $600-million contract with theCentral Intelligence Agency(CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[61]In October of that year, Amazon was recognized as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[62]Bezos in 2010In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, the largest sum he had ever raised from selling some of his Amazon stock.[63]On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares for $756.7 million.[64]A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employees when he ramped up hiring at company distribution centers.[65]By January 19, 2018, his Amazon stock holdings had appreciated to slightly over $109 billion; months later he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular,Blue Origin.[66]On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon'sSuper Bowl commercial.[67]On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterlyearningsof $2 billion.[68]Due to the growth ofAlibabain China, Bezos has often expressed interest in expanding Amazon intoIndia.[69]On July 27, 2017, Bezos momentarily became theworld's wealthiest personoverMicrosoftco-founderBill Gateswhen his estimatednet worthincreased to just over $90 billion. His wealth surpassed $100 billion for the first time on November 24, 2017, and he was formally designated the wealthiest person in the world byForbeson March 6, 2018, with a net worth of $112 billion.[70]Bezos receives theJames Smithson Bicentennialmedal on June 14, 2016, for his work with Amazon.[71]In March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon's global senior vice president, to India with $5.5 billion to localize operations throughout the company'ssupply chainroutes.[72]Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon and Bezos, specifically ofsales taxavoidance, misusingpostal routes, andanti-competitivebusiness practices.[73]Amazon's share price fell by 9% in response to the President's negative comments; this reduced Bezos's personal wealth by $10.7 billion.[74]Weeks later, Bezos recouped his losses when academic reports out ofStanford Universityindicated that Trump could do little to regulate Amazon in any meaningful way.[75]During July 2018, a number of members of the U.S. Congress called on Bezos to detail the applications of Amazon'sface recognitionsoftware,Rekognition.[76]Bezos on October 25, 2017, on his visit toLos Angeles Air Force Base.[77]Criticism of Amazon's business practices continued in September 2018 when SenatorBernie Sandersintroduced the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act and accused Amazon of receivingcorporate welfare.[78]This followed revelations by the non-profit group New Food Economy which found that one third of Amazon workers inArizona, and one tenth of Amazon workers inPennsylvaniaandOhio, relied on food stamps.[79]While preparing to introduce the bill, Sanders opined: "Instead of attempting to explore Mars or go to the moon, how about Jeff Bezos pays his workers a living wage?"[80]He later said: "Bezos could play a profound role. If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America."[81]Sanders's efforts elicited a response from Amazon which pointed to the 130,000 jobs it created in 2017 and called the $28,446 figure for its median salary "misleading" as it included part-time workers.[82]However, Sanders countered that the companies targeted by his proposal have placed an increased focus on part-time workers to escape benefit obligations.[83]On October 2, 2018, Bezos announced a company-wide wage increase, which Sanders applauded.[84]The American workers who were being paid the minimum wage had this increased to $15 per hour, a decision that was interpreted as support for theFight for $15movement.[85]In February 2021, Bezos announced that in thethird quarterof 2021 he would step down from his role as CEO of Amazon to become the Executive Chairman of the Amazon Board.

Bezos was a multi-billionaire who drove a 1996Honda Accord.[139]Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy.[140][141][142]Bezos was seen by some as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[143][144]This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman, who described him as "talking in lists" and "[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made."[140]Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stone wrotea bookthat described Bezos as a demanding boss as well ashyper-competitive,[136][143]and opined that Bezos perhaps "bet the biggest on the Internet" than anyone else.[145]Bezos has been characterized as a notoriously opportunistic CEO who operates with little concern for obstacles andexternalities.[146][147]During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for aggressive business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to weartailored clothing; heweight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[148]His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as themetonymof the company.[149][150]His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has beenparodiedas an enterprisingsupervillain.[151][152][153]Since 2017, he has been portrayed byKyle MooneyandSteve CarellonSaturday Night Live, usually as an undercutting, domineering figure.[154][better source needed]In May 2014, theInternational Trade Union Confederationnamed Bezos the "World's Worst Boss", with its general secretarySharan Burrowsaying: "Jeff Bezos represents the inhumanity of employers who are promoting the North American corporate model",[155]while in 2019,Harvard Business Review, which ranked Bezos the best-performing CEO for 4 years in a row since 2014, did not rank him even in the top 100, citing Amazon's "relatively low ESG (environment,social, andgovernance) scores" that reflect "risks created byworking conditionsand employment policies,data security, andantitrustissues."[156]During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business-related expenses.[27]His relative lack of philanthropy compared to other billionaires has drawn a negative response from the public since 2016.[157][27]Bezos has been known to publicly contest claims made in critical articles, as exemplified in 2015 when he sent a memo to employees denouncing aNew York Timespiece.[158][159]Leadership style"Day 1" Management PhilosophyDay 1:start upDay 2:stasisDay 3:irrelevanceDay 4: "excruciating, painful decline"Day 5:deathBezos has stated "it is always Day 1" to describe hisgrowth mindset.[160][161]Bezos used what he called a "regret-minimization framework" while he worked atD. E. Shawand again during the early years of Amazon. He described thislife philosophyby stating: "When I'm 80, am I going to regret leaving Wall Street? No. Will I regret missing the beginning of the Internet? Yes."[162]During the 1990s and early 2000s at Amazon, he was characterized as trying to quantify all aspects of running the company, often listing employees on spreadsheets and basing executive decisions on data.[38]To push Amazon forward, Bezos developed themantra"Get Big Fast", establishing the company's need toscaleits operations to produce market dominance.[50]He favored diverting Amazon profits back into the company in lieu of allocating it amongst shareholders in the form ofdividends.[140]Bezos uses the term "work–life harmony" instead of the more standard "work–life balance" because he believes thatbalanceimplies that you can only have one and not the other. He believes that work and home life are interconnected, informing and calibrating each other.[163]JournalistWalt Mossbergdubbed the idea that someone who cannot tolerate criticism or critique shouldn't do anything new or interesting "The Bezos Principle".[164]Bezos does not schedule early morning meetings and enforces a two-pizza rule—a preference that meetings are small enough for twopizzasto feed everyone in the boardroom.[165]When interviewing candidates for jobs at Amazon, he has stated he considers three inquiries: can he admire the person, can the person raise thecommon standard, and under what circumstances could the person become exemplary.[166]In 2018, it was reported that he met with Amazon investors for just six hours a year.[165]Instead of usingpresentation slides, Bezos requires high-level employees to present information with six-page narratives.[167]Since 1998, Bezos has published an annual letter for Amazon shareholders wherein he frequently refers to five principles: focus on customers, not competitors; take risks formarket leadership; facilitate staff morale; build acompany culture; and empower people.[168][169]Bezos maintains the email address jeff@amazon.com[170]as an outlet for customers to reach out to him and the company. Although he does not respond to the emails, he forwards some of them with a question mark in the subject line to executives who attempt to address the issues.[171]Bezos has citedJeff ImmeltofNew Enterprise Associates,[172]Warren BuffettofBerkshire Hathaway,Jamie DimonofJPMorgan Chase, andBob IgerofThe Walt Disney Companyas major influences on his leadership style.[172][173]RecognitionIn 1999, Bezos received his first major award whenTimenamed himPerson of the Year.[174]In 2008, he was selected byU.S. News & World Reportas one of America's best leaders.[175]Bezos was awarded an honorary doctorate in science and technology fromCarnegie Mellon Universityin 2008.[176]In 2011,The Economistgave Bezos and Gregg Zehr an Innovation Award for theAmazon Kindle.[177]In 2012, Bezos was named Businessperson of the Year byFortune.[178]He is also a member of theBilderberg Groupand attended the 2011 Bilderberg conference inSt. Moritz, Switzerland,[179]and the2013 conferenceinWatford, Hertfordshire, England.

When he was designated the "world wealthiest person" on March 6, 2018, theForbesThe World's Billionaireslist stipulated that although Bezos was the firstcenti-billionaire(i.e. +US$100 billion in net worth), it wasBill Gateswho had the most money when taken inreal terms.[220]In such terms, Gates had $150 billion while Bezos had $100 billion. However, in July 2018, the net worth of Bezos officially surpassed the $150 billion mark, which led most major wealth indexes to label him the wealthiest person in modern history (post-1982).[221]References^Jonge, Peter de (March 14, 1999)."Riding the Wild, Perilous Waters of Amazone.com".The New York Times.ISSN0362-4331.

But behind his mythic origins is a journey that shows the power of education to inform and inspire.The importance of education was instilled in Bezos from a young age.Bezos was born to a single teen momwho completed high school and later brought her baby along when she attended night classes. Growing up, Bezos attended publicschools in Texasand Florida.In high school, Bezos worked thebreakfast shift at McDonald'sas a short-order cook. He was a high-achieving student, becoming aNational Merit Scholarand a member of the honor societyPhi Beta Kappa.Likewise, while still in high school, Bezos participated in the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida. In hisvaledictorian speech, he talked about colonizing space as a way to save the Earth.Where Did Jeff Bezos Go to College?When Bezos enrolled atPrinceton University, he set out to study space as a physics major.Inspired by Stephen Hawking, he dreamt of becoming a theoretical physicist and ran the Princeton chapter of Students for the Exploration and Development of Space.However, it wasn't long beforeBezos realizedhe would never be at the top of his field in physics. He wanted to go where he could "make a contribution," so he switched to double majoring inelectrical engineeringand computer science. Bezos was elected to Tau Beta Pi — the engineering honor society — and graduated in 1986 summa cum laude.Bezos fielded job offers from Intel and Bell Labs, but opted to work for a fintech startup. After that, Bezos joined a nascent hedge fund experimenting with mathematical modeling.In late 1993, 30-year-old Bezos left his position as a senior vice president of the firm. He took $300,000 in seed money from his parents, made a cross-country road trip to Seattle, andstarted Amazon.comout of his garage.Bezos never returned to academia, but received an honorary doctorate in science and technology fromCarnegie Mellon Universityin 2008. A decade later, Bezos was elected to theNational Academy of Engineering.Bezos' Goals Stem From Princeton Physics ProfessorAmazon expanded beyond books to other consumer goods, and then began to grow into increasingly diverse industries. Once upon a time Amazon nearly went bankrupt, but soonrebounded to twice its former strength. Today, the tech giant shows no signs of flagging. Although the average household debt in the U.S. has risen dramatically since early 2020,Bezos' wealth has grownby 70% since the beginning of the pandemic.Amazon's success funds Bezos' real ambitions — the space missions he fixated on as a student but put aside when he switched majors.In 1976, four years before Bezos arrived on campus, Princeton physicist Gerard K. O'Neill published a book detailing plans to move into space — "The High Frontier." Bezosattended some of O'Neill's seminars. Through Blue Origin, Bezos' space flight company, he's taking steps toward realizing O'Neill's vision.While Bezos controls huge swathes of e-commerce, book sales, and video streaming, it's his forays into cloud-computing, artificial intelligence, and space travel that receive most of his attention. In July, Bezos stepped down as CEO of Amazon tofocus on his passions, including his newspaper The Washington Post, prolonging life, and going to space.His last letter to shareholdersquoted geneticist Richard Dawkins: "Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at... If living things don't actively work to prevent it, they would eventually merge with their surroundings and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die."Bezos recently helped launchAltos Labs, a biotechnology company looking to develop therapy to reprogram aging cells. Bezos is also a major investor inUnity Biotechnology, a life-extension research firm exploring how to slow or stop aging.Criticized for Business Practices, Bezos Invests in EducationBezos' reputation as aruthless bosshas far-reaching implications that impact the working class on a large scale. For example, the nonprofit group New Food Economy found that one-third of Amazon workers in Arizona, as well as one-tenth of Amazon workers in Pennsylvania and Ohio,rely on food stamps.In 2018, Senator Bernie Sanders introduced theStop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies(Stop BEZOS) Act, which would have required major employers like Amazon to reimburse the government for the food stamps and other federal benefits that their workers receive. While president,Donald Trump accused Bezosof sales tax avoidance.Around the same time thatBezos dropped offthe Harvard Business Review's rankings of best-performing CEOs — due to "working conditions and employment policies, data security, and antitrust issues" — Bezos made his first major forays into philanthropy.In January 2018, Bezos made a$33 million donation to TheDream.US, a college scholarship fund for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.
