Williams(born September 26, 1981)[1]is an American inactive professionaltennisplayer. Considered among the greatest tennis players of all time,[a]she was rankedworld No. 1in singles by theWomen's Tennis Association(WTA) for 319 weeks, including a joint-record 186 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. She won 23Grand Slamsingles titles, the most by any player in theOpen Era, and thesecond-most of all time. She is the only player, male or female, to accomplish aCareer Golden Slamin both singles and doubles.[19]Along with her older sisterVenus, Serena Williams was coached by her parentsOracene PriceandRichard Williams. Turning professional in 1995, she won her first major singles title at the1999 US Open. From the2002 French Opento the2003 Australian Open, she was dominant, winning all four major singles titles (each time over Venus in the final) to achieve anon-calendar year Grand Slamand thecareer Grand Slam, known as the 'Serena Slam'. The next few years saw her claim two more singles majors, but suffer from injury and decline in form. Beginning in 2007, however, she gradually returned to form despite continued injuries, retaking the world No. 1 singles ranking. Beginning at the2012 Wimbledon Championships, Williams returned to dominance, claimingOlympic gold(completing the Career Golden Slam in singles)[20]and winning eight out of thirteen singles majors, including all four in a row from 2014–15 to achieve a second "Serena Slam". At the2017 Australian Open, she won her 23rd major singles title, surpassingSteffi Graf's Open Era record. She then took a break from professional tennis after becoming pregnant and reached four major finals upon returning to play. In August 2022, Williams announced her impending "evolution" away from professional tennis and played what was expected to be her final match at the2022 US Open.[21]Williams also won 14 major women's doubles titles, all with her sister Venus, and the pair was unbeaten in major doubles finals (the best unbeaten record in major finals in any discipline of the sport).[22][23]The pair achieved a non-calendar year Grand Slam between the2009 Wimbledon Championshipsand the2010 French Open, which granted the sisters thedoubles world No. 1 ranking. Serena won fourOlympic gold medals, three in women's doubles—an all-time joint record in tennis, shared with her sister.[24][25]The duo are the only women in the Open Era to win Olympic gold in both singles and doubles.[26]She also won two major mixed doubles titles, both in 1998. She is the only singles player, male or female, to complete three Career Golden Slams – one in women's singles and two in same-sex doubles.[19]The arrival of theWilliams sistershas been credited with ushering in a new era of power and athleticism on the women's professional tennis tour.[27][28][29][30]Serena holds a combined 39 major titles: 23 in singles, 14 in women's doubles, and two in mixed doubles. She isjoint-third on the all-time listand second in the Open Era for total major titles. She is the most recent woman to simultaneously hold all four major singles titles (2002–03 and 2014–15), and the most recent woman to win theSurface Slam(major titles onhard,clayandgrasscourts in the same calendar year), doing so in 2015. She is also, with Venus, the most recent player to have simultaneously held all four major women's doubles titles (2009–10).Williams was the world's highest paid woman athlete in 2016, earning almost $29 million.[31]She repeated this feat in 2017 when she was the only woman onForbes'list of the 100 highest-paid athletes, with $27million in prize money and endorsements. She won theLaureus Sportswoman of the Yearaward a record four times (2003, 2010, 2016, 2018), and in December 2015 was namedSportsperson of the YearbySports Illustratedmagazine.[32]She is the highest-earning woman athlete of all time.[33]Early lifeWilliams was born on September 26, 1981, inSaginaw, MichigantoOracene PriceandRichard Williams. She is the youngest of Price's five daughters: half-sistersYetunde, Lyndrea, and Isha Price, and full older sisterVenus.[1]She also has at least seven paternal half-siblings.[34][35]When the children were young, the family moved toCompton, California, where she started playing tennis at age four.[36][37]Her father home-schooled her and her sister, Venus.[38][39]While he and subsequently her mother have been their official coaches, her other mentors have included Richard Williams, a Compton man who shared her father's name and subsequently founded The Venus and Serena Williams Tennis Tutorial Academy.[40]Williams sisters at aPam Shriverevent in Baltimore, 1993When Williams was nine, she and her family moved from Compton toWest Palm Beach, Florida[36]so she could attend the tennis academy ofRick Macci, who provided her with additional coaching. Macci did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls".[41]Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, as he wanted them to "go slowly" and focus on school work. Experiences of racism also influenced this decision, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments.[42]At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on theUnited States Tennis Associationjunior tour and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida.[43]In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether it would have been more beneficial for them to have followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit, Williams responded, "Everyone does different things. I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us."[43]Professional career1995–1998: Professional debutWilliams' parents wanted their daughter to wait until she was 16 to participate in professional tournaments.[44]In 1995, just after turning 14, Williams planned to make her professional debut as awild-cardentry in theBank of the West ClassicinOakland, California, but was denied by the WTA owing to their age-eligibility restrictions.[45]She subsequently filed an antitrust lawsuit against the women's tour, but withdrew it at her parents' request.[45]Her first professional event was in October 1995 at theBell ChallengeinQuebec,[44][46]where she used a wild-card entry to circumvent age-eligibility rules.[44]She lost in the first qualifying round to then 18-year-old AmericanAnnie Miller, winning just two games.[47]Williams did not play a tournament in 1996. The next year, she lost in the qualifying rounds of three tournaments,[48]before winning her first main-draw match in November at theAmeritech Cup Chicago.[49]Ranked No. 304, she upset No. 7Mary Pierce, and No. 4Monica Seles,[50][51]recording her first career wins over top10 players and becoming the lowest-ranked player in the Open Era to defeat two top-10 opponents in one tournament.[1]She ultimately lost in the semifinals to No. 5Lindsay Davenport.[52]She finished 1997 ranked No. 99.[53]Williams began 1998 at theMedibank International Sydney.[54]As a qualifier ranked No. 96,[55]she defeated No. 3 Davenport in the quarterfinals,[55]before losing toArantxa Sánchez Vicarioin the semifinals.[56]Williams made her debut in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament at theAustralian Open,[57]where she defeated sixth-seededIrina Spîrleain the first round,[58]before losing to her sister, Venus, in the second round in the sisters' first professional match.[58][54]She reached six other quarterfinals during the year, but lost all of them,[59]including her first match against No. 1-rankedMartina Hingisat theLipton International Players Championshipsin Key Biscayne,[60]and her second match against Venus at theItalian Openin Rome.[59]She failed to reach the quarterfinals of any Grand Slam tournament the remainder of the year,[citation needed]losing in the fourth round of the French Open to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario,[61]and the third round of theUS Opento Spîrlea.[62]She withdrew fromWimbledontwo games into a match withVirginia Ruano Pascual, after straining a calf muscle during the first set.[63]She did win the mixed doubles titles atWimbledonand theUS OpenwithMax Mirnyi, completing the Williams family's sweep of the 1998 mixed doubles Grand Slam tournaments. She won her first professional title in doubles at theU.S. National Indoor Championshipsin Oklahoma City with Venus, becoming the third pair of sisters to win a WTA title.[1]They won two more doubles titles that year. Williams finished the year ranked No. 20 in singles.[citation needed]Battle of the sexes: Karsten Braasch vs. the Williams sistersMain article:Battle of the Sexes (tennis)A 16-year-old Serena and her sister Venus competed in a tennis "Battle of the Sexes" againstKarsten Braaschat the 1998 Australian Open.[64]At the time Braasch was 203rd in the ATP rankings. The sisters had claimed they could beat any man outside the top 200, and accepted his challenge. Braasch beat both of them, playing one set against each. The score versus Serena was 6–1 and 6–2 against Venus.[65]Braasch said afterward, "500 and above, no chance." The sisters later tweaked the number to beating men outside the top 350.[66]1999–2001: Becoming a top-10 playerWilliams lost in the third round of the1999 Australian OpentoSandrine Testud. A month later, Williams won her first professional singles title when she defeatedAmélie Mauresmoin the final of theOpen Gaz de Francein Paris. With Venus also winning theIGA Superthrift Classicin Memphis, Tennessee, that day, the pair became the first sisters to win professional tournaments in the same week.[67]In March of that year, at theEvert Cupin California, Williams won her firstTier Ititle, defeatingSteffi Grafin the final. Soon afterward at theMiami Masters, Williams had her 16-match winning streak ended by her sister in the first all-sister singles final in WTA history,[54]and she then made her top-10 debut, at No. 9. She then lost in the quarterfinals of theItalian Open[68]and theGerman Open,[69]and the third round of theFrench Open,[70]where she and Venus won the women's doubles title.[54]Williams then missedWimbledonbecause of injury. When she returned to the tour, Williams won aFed Cupsingles match and then won theJPMorgan Chase Openin Los Angeles, beatingJulie Halard-Decugisin the final. She then defeated in succession Grand Slam championsKim Clijsters,Conchita Martínez,Monica Seles, and defending champion Lindsay Davenport to reach theUS Openfinal, where she defeated No. 1, Hingis, to become the second African-American woman, afterAlthea Gibsonin 1958, to win a Grand Slam singles tournament.[1]The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at this tournament. To complete her 1999 season, Williams won a doubles match in the Fed Cup final against Russia. Williams ended the year ranked No. 4 in just her second full year on the main tour.[71]Williams started 2000 by losing in the fourth round of theAustralian OpentoElena Likhovtseva. She failed to defend her titles in Paris and Indian Wells, although she did win theFaber Grand Prixin Germany. Soon afterwards, Williams missed theFrench Openbecause of injury. She returned from injury at theWimbledon Championships, where she lost to Venus in the semifinals, but the pair won the doubles title at the event. Williams successfully defended her title in Los Angeles, defeating Davenport in the final. She reached the final of theDu Maurier Openwhere an injury forced her to retire from her match with Hingis. Her defense of theUS Opentitle ended when she lost in the quarterfinals to Davenport. Williams teamed with Venus to win the gold medal in doubles at theSydney Olympicsthat September. She ended the year winning theToyota Princess Cupin Japan and she finished the year ranked No. 6.[citation needed]Williams began 2001 losing to Martina Hingis in the quarterfinals of the Medibank International inSydneyand the Australian Open in Melbourne. Williams and her sister won the doubles title at the latter tournament, becoming only the fifth doubles team in history to win all four Grand Slam women's doubles titles during their career, completing a "Career Grand Slam". Her next event was thePacific Life Openin California, where she defeated Kim Clijsters in the final. The final was marred by the behavior of the crowd toward Williams and her family. Crowd members were incensed at the perceived match-fixing of games involving the family afterVenus withdrewbefore their semifinal. Neither Williams nor her sister entered the tournament for fourteen years until Williams entered in 2015 as a wildcard (and the top seed).[72]The following week at theEricsson Openin Miami, Williams lost toJennifer Capriatiin the quarterfinals. She then lost in the quarterfinals to Capriati at both theFrench OpenandWimbledon Championships. That was the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament at which Williams had exited in the quarterfinals. During the North American hard-court season, she lost in the quarterfinals ofLos Angelesagainst Monica Seles, then captured her second title of the year at theRogers Cup, defeating Capriati in the final. Williams reached the final of the 2001 US Open, losing to sister Venus. That was the first Grand Slam tournament final contested by two sisters during the Open Era. At the 2001 season-endingTour Championships, Williams won the championship by walkover when Davenport withdrew before the start of the final because of a knee injury. Williams finished 2001 at No. 6 for the second straight year.[citation needed]2002–2003: "Serena Slam"Early 2002, injury saw Williams retire from the semifinal at theMedibank International Sydneyand later withdraw from theAustralian Open.[73]Playing Amélie Mauresmo in the quarterfinals of the tournament in Sydney in 2002Returning from injury, Williams won her first title of the year inScottsdale, Arizona, defeating No. 2 Jennifer Capriati, in the final. She then won the Miami Masters for the first time, becoming one of three players in the Open Era to defeat the world's top 3 ranked players at one tournament,[1]after beating No. 3, Martina Hingis, in the quarterfinals, No. 2 Venus in the semifinals, and the top-ranked player, Capriati, in the final. Serena's straight set win over Venus was her second career win over her sister.[citation needed]Williams played three clay-court tournaments before the2002 French Open. Her first tournament was atCharleston, where she was the third seed. Williams reached the quarterfinals before losing toPatty Schnyder. She reached her first clay-court final in May, at theEurocard German Openlosing toJustine Heninin a third set tiebreak. Williams went on to win her first clay court title at theItalian Open, defeating Capriati in the semifinals and Henin in the final.[74]This raised her ranking to a new high of No. 3. Williams was the third seed at the French Open at Roland Garros, where she claimed her first title thereby defeating defending champion Capriati in the semifinals and sister Venus in the final to win her second Grand Slam tournament title (and her first in two-and-a-half years). As a result of raising the trophy atCourt Philippe Chatrier, Williams rose to a career-high of No. 2, second only to Venus.[citation needed]At the2002 Wimbledon Championships, Williams won tennis's oldest championship for the first time in her life, defeating Venus to win a Grand Slam singles title without dropping a set for the first time in her career. This victory earned Williams the world No. 1 ranking for the first time, dethroning her sister and becoming only the third African American woman to hold that ranking.[1]The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at the tournament, the fifth Grand Slam doubles title for the pair. Williams played just one tournament between Wimbledon and theUS Open, losing in the quarterfinals of theJPMorgan Chase Openin Los Angeles to AmericanChanda Rubinand ending a 21-match winning streak. The top-seeded player at the US Open, Williams reached the final where, for the third Grand Slam in a row, she defeated her sister to win the title, the second US Open crown of her career. Williams won two consecutive singles titles in the fall, defeating Kim Clijsters to win theToyota Princess Cupin Tokyo, andAnastasia Myskinato win theSparkassen Cupin Leipzig, Germany. She reached the final at the year-endHome Depot Championshipsat theStaples Centerin Los Angeles, where she lost to fifth-seeded Clijsters in straight sets, ending an 18-match winning streak.[citation needed]Williams finished 2002 with a 56–5 W/L record, eight singles titles, and the No. 1 ranking. She was the first African-American to end a year with that ranking sinceAlthea Gibsonin 1958[citation needed]and was the first woman to win three Grand Slam tournament titles in one year since Hingis in 1997.[1]Her three consecutive Grand Slam titles to close 2002 also made Williams only the third player in tennis history to win the "Surface Slam",[75]three Slam titles on three surfaces in the same calendar year, after Navratilova (1984) and Graf (1993, 1995, 1996).[citation needed]At the2003 Australian Open, Williams reached the tournament's semifinals for the first time, where she recovered from 5–1 down in the third set and saved two match points before defeating Clijsters. In the final, Serena faced Venus for the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament final, defeating her older sister to become the sixth woman in the Open Era to complete a career Grand Slam, alongsideMargaret Court,Billie Jean King,Chris Evert,Martina Navratilova, andSteffi Graf. She also became the fifth woman to hold all Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously, joiningMaureen Connolly Brinker, Court, Graf, and Navratilova. This feat was dubbed the "Serena Slam" by the press.[76][77]TheWilliams sisterswon their sixth Grand Slam doubles title together at this event.[78]During the spring of 2003, Williams captured the singles titles at theOpen Gaz de Franceand theSony Ericsson Open. Williams's winning streak came to an end when she lost the final of theFamily Circle Cupto Henin, her first loss of the year after 21 wins. She also lost to Mauresmo in the semifinals of theInternazionali BNL d'Italiain Rome. Despite these losses, Williams was the top seed at theFrench Open, where she lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Henin, marking Williams's first loss in a Grand Slam tournament since 2001. The match was controversial, as Williams questioned Henin's sportsmanship, and spectators applauded Williams's errors.[79]Williams rebounded from the French Open loss a couple weeks later at the2003 Wimbledon Championships, defeating Henin in the semifinals and Venus in the final. This was Williams's second consecutive Wimbledon title and her sixth Grand Slam singles title overall. Wimbledon was Williams's last tournament of 2003; she pulled out of three events in the US and then underwent surgery on the quadriceps tendon in her knee in early August. Williams was initially expected to be out for six to eight weeks.[80]2004–2007: Injuries and the comebackMain articles:2004,2005,2006, and2007 Serena Williams tennis seasonAfter eight months away from the tour, during which time her desire was questioned,[81]Williams began her comeback at the 2004NASDAQ-100 Openin Miami in March, where she made a triumphant return as she won the title for the third consecutive year.Delivering a serve at an exhibition in November 2004Although ranked No. 7, Williams was seeded second at the French Open, where, after winning four matches, she lost to Capriati in the quarterfinals. That was the first time that Williams had lost before the semifinals at a Grand Slam singles tournament since Wimbledon in 2001. A few weeks later, even though her ranking had dropped to No. 10, Williams was seeded first atWimbledon. She won six matches en route to the final, where 13th-seededMaria Sharapovadefeated her in straight sets. This loss caused her ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the first time since 1999. Later that summer, Williams reached her third final of the year at the JPMorgan Chase Open in Los Angeles where she lost to Lindsay Davenport which was her first loss to the American since the 2000 US Open. After missing her national championship in 2003, Williams returned for the2004 US Open, where she was seeded third despite her No. 11 ranking. She lost in the U.S. Open quarterfinals to Capriati in three sets in controversial fashion.[82]That fall, Williams won her second title of the year, at theChina Open, defeating US Open championSvetlana Kuznetsovain the final. Williams's successful season allowed her to qualify for theTour Championships, held again in Los Angeles. In the round-robin phase of the tournament, Williams defeated Dementieva andAnastasia Myskinaand lost to Davenport, but still advanced to the elimination stage. After winning her semifinal, she lost to Sharapova in the final, where she suffered an abdominal injury.[83]Williams finished 2004 ranked No. 7, but did not win a Grand Slam singles tournament for the first season since 2001.[citation needed]At the2005 Australian Open, Williams rejected suggestions that she and sister Venus were a declining force in tennis, following Venus's early exit.[84]Williams saved three match points to defeat Sharapova 8–6 in the third of their semifinal. In the final, Williams defeated top seed Davenport to win her second Australian Open and seventh Grand Slam singles title, winning 12 of the last 15 games.[85]The win moved Williams back to No. 2 but stated she was targeting the top spot.[86]Williams completed just two tournaments between the Australian Open and Wimbledon, losing to Venus in Miami and at Internazionali BNL d'Italia toFrancesca Schiavoneas Williams suffered a series of retirements and withdraws.[87][88]A reoccurring ankle injury causing her to miss theFrench Open.[89]She returned forWimbledonas the 4th-seeded player, but was defeated in the third round by No. 85,Jill Craybas. At theUS Open, Williams lost to her sister Venus in the fourth round. This was the earliest the sisters had met in a Grand Slam tournament since their first meeting, at the 1998 Australian Open. Williams played just one more match that fall, a loss to No. 127Sun Tiantianat thetournament in Beijing. She failed to qualify for the year-end championship for the first time since 1998 and she finished the year 2005 ranked No. 11, her first time finishing the season outside the top 10 since 1998.[citation needed]Williams made her 2006 debut at theAustralian Open. Defending the title, Williams lost toDaniela Hantuchováin the third round.[90]After the tournament, she told the press that she was injured, blaming a lack of fitness and a knee injury for keeping her off the court.[91]In her biography, Williams claims that she was actually suffering from depression. She stayed away from pro tennis for six months during the 2006 season. After she had shut herself off from the world for a period, Williams saw a therapist daily.[92]After a chance meeting with a young girl who idolized Williams and believed that she could still win, Williams signed up to play in Cincinnati,[93]her first tournament since Melbourne. Williams had slipped to No. 139, the lowest ranking she had held since 1997. On her return, Williams defeated Myskina andBethanie Mattek,[94][95]before losing in the semifinals toVera Zvonareva.[96]She also reached the semifinals in Los Angeles, losing to Janković in straight sets. At theUS Open, Williams needed a wildcard to enter the tournament, as her ranking at the cut-off time was No. 139, outside the automatic 102. Her ranking had improved to 79th by the time the tournament came around.[97]She lost to top-seeded Mauresmo in the fourth round.[98]Following the US Open, she did not play again in 2006, ending the year ranked No. 95, her lowest year-end ranking since 1997.[citation needed]Williams began 2007 with renewed confidence, stating her intention to return to the top of the rankings,[99]a comment 1987 Wimbledon men's singles champion and commentatorPat Cashbranded "deluded".[100]Williams lost in the quarterfinals of theHobart International, a warm-up for theAustralian Openwhere Williams was unseeded because of her No. 81 ranking and was widely regarded as "out of shape".[101]She experienced a huge amount of pressure on herself before the tournament, coming from her fans and the press as well as Williams herself about her weight, focus and needing a good showing.[citation needed]Shortly before her first match, a representative from Nike paid her a visit in the players' lounge, informing her that if she did not perform to her accustomed level, the company might drop her. Williams claimed that Nike's ultimatum meant that she would have to reach the quarterfinals at least.[102]The distraction from Nike did not distract Williams, as she lost just three games toMara Santangeloand defeated Anne Kremer in straight sets.[103]By this point, a blister had developed on Williams's foot and she had contracted a cold.

With a world ranking at the time of 181,[257]many felt that the decision showed bias and favored Williams unduly.[258]Others argued that theAll England Club, who do not base their seedings on players' current world rankings – as other grand slam tournaments do– had sensibly considered Williams's excellent historic record there. Williams herself said: "I was pleasantly surprised. I came in here expecting that maybe I wouldn't get a seed."[258]Her seeding resulted inDominika Cibulkoválosing her place to be seeded.[citation needed]By the second week of the tournament, for the first time in grand slam history, none of the top ten seeded women players had made it to the quarterfinals.[259]En route to the quarterfinals, Williams had beatenArantxa Rusof Holland in round one,Viktoriya Tomovaof Bulgaria in round 2,Kristina Mladenovicof France in round 3 andEvgeniya Rodinaof Russia in round 4.[260]She had not lost a set in any of her matches till then.

This was Williams's earliest defeat at the Australian Open since her fourth-round loss in2014, and broke a streak of fourteen consecutive match wins in Grand Slam quarterfinals (having last lost a Grand Slam quarterfinal at the2013 Australian Open).

When leaving the court after losing to Osaka in the Australian Open, Williams paused to acknowledge the crowd longer than she usually would. In the press conference following the match, she faced questions about whether she was bidding farewell to tennis and retiring. She said "I don't know, if I ever say farewell, I wouldn't tell anyone."[277]In May, at theItalian Open, Serena Williams played her 1000th match of her career.[278]She was defeated byNadia Podoroskain the second round in straight sets.[279]On June 29, Williams would suffer an injury during the first set in the first round atWimbledonagainst Belarusian playerAliaksandra Sasnovich, forcing her to withdraw from the competition.[280][281]In August 2021, a leg injury forced Williams to withdraw from2021 US Open.[282]Her withdrawal saw Williams plummet nineteen places to 41st in the world, her lowest year-end ranking in 15 years.2022:King Richardpromotion, Wimbledon and US Open, retirementThe Williams sisters in 2022 during their final doubles match togetherIn December 2021, Williams announced she would not play the2022 Australian Open, citing the same leg injury.[283]As of March 2022, she was ranked 241st.She spent much of early 2022 promotingKing Richardabout her father with her sisters.

She beatNuria Párrizas Díazin straight sets for her first singles win in 14 months, before losing toBelinda Bencic.[294][295]Williams subsequently entered the2022 Cincinnati Masters, in which she lost to reigning US Open championEmma Raducanuin the first round.[296]Before the US Open, Williams announced she would play doubles with Venus for the first time since 2018.

In her announcement she said that she disliked the word "retirement" and preferred the term "evolution".[298]She went on to cite growing her family, focusing on her venture capital firm, and spending more time with family as reasons she would be leaving the sport. While she did not set an exact time for her goodbye, she stated that she was not ready to winWimbledon(where shelost in the first round), but would try to win inNew York. She also said that she consultedTiger Woodsin her decision.[298]At her first match since the publication of theVoguearticle, where she lost toBelinda BencicinToronto, tournament organizers interviewed Williams on-court after her match and gave her gifts to remember the city.[299]At her matches at the2022 US Open, which many believed would be her last tournament, tournament directors played a video following her opponents' introduction but before Williams' walk-out. Some saw this as disrespectful to her opponents.[300]Following her first-round match, where Woods,Mike Tyson,Bill Clinton,Ruth Westheimer,Spike Lee,Vera Wang, andEric Adamswere in attendance, the tournament played a video narrated byOprah Winfreyand hadGayle Kingfacilitate the post-match on-court interview.[301][302][303]Following her announcement, many fellow players, includingNaomi OsakaandCoco Gauff, praised Williams and said they would not be playing tennis if not for her.[304]Playing styleWilliams is anaggressive baseliner, whose game is centered around her powerful serve and forceful groundstrokes. Owing to her high-risk playing style, she typically hits a large number of both winners and unforced errors. Williams' greatest asset is her serve, which is considered the greatest in the history of women's tennis. Her serve is known for its fast pace and accurate placement, allowing her to serve numerous aces: at the2013 Australian Open, she served a 128.6 mph (207 km/h) ace in her third round match againstAyumi Morita, which is the third fastest serve recorded in WTA history.[305]Williams possesses an accurate and consistent ball toss, allowing her to serve to any position on the court with minimal differences in the position of the ball in the air; this makes it difficult for opponents to read her service motion and predict the position of her serve, allowing her to dominate a rally from the first stroke.[306]Williams also possesses effective and accurate kick and slice serves, which she deploys as second serves, minimizing double faults, and preventing opponents from scoring free points.[307]Williams is also known for her forceful groundstrokes, which are considered two of the most powerful shots in the history of women's tennis.[308]She hits both her forehand and her backhand in an open stance, allowing her to generate consistently powerful, heavy, and dominating groundstrokes, and to generate sharp, acute angles, which allow her to hit winners from any position on the court.[309]Williams is known for her forehand, which has been described as "devastating".[310]Her forehand is hit with heavy topspin; this allows her to dominate rallies, and she is capable of hitting her forehand both crosscourt and down the line to produce winners.[311]Her two-handed backhand is equally dominant, and has been described as one of the greatest backhands of all time.[312]Williams tends to hit her backhand flatter than her forehand, allowing her to hit her backhand with speed, power, and depth both crosscourt and down the line. Despite playing primarily from the baseline, Williams is an adept net player thanks to her extensive doubles experience, and will frequently choose to finish points at the net, either with deft touch, aggressive drive volleys, or a solid, powerful, and reliable overhead smash.[313]Williams possesses an aggressive return of serve – she neutralizes powerful first serves, and attacks weak second serves. She is widely considered one of the greatest return players of all time.[314]Despite predominantly employing an aggressive game style, she is also an excellent defender, and is capable of counterpunching against aggressive opponents until she creates an opportunity to hit a winner. She is an exceptional athlete, known for her movement, speed, court coverage, agility, flexibility, balance, and footwork. Her on-court intelligence, shot selection, and point construction allow her to execute her gamestyle effectively.[315]She has been praised for her mental strength and competitive spirit, with her being described as one of the toughest opponents to beat on the court;Martina Navratilovadeclared her mental strength "unbelievable",[316]whilst tennis journalistJon Wertheimclaimed that Williams is the toughest player of all time.[317]American tennis playerChristina McHalepraised her composure in high pressure moments, stating that, for Williams, "being clutch is like breathing", and that she "seems to come through every single time in the most pressure-packed situations".[318]She has been noted for her ability to produce extraordinary comebacks, particularly on the Grand Slam level, winning three Slams after saving match points, a feat achieved more often than by any other player in tennis history.[319]Williams bounced back from a set down to win 37 Grand Slam matches; her ability to come back from set and break deficits in Grand Slam matches was described byJohn McEnroeas "a gift", and McEnroe declared that she was "the greatest" competitor in the history of women's tennis.[320]She has also been praised for her ability to serve aces at critical moments. As noted by retired playerLi Nain 2016, "break point down, [there is an] 80% chance [she] serves an ace".[321]Owing to her exceptional serve, powerful groundstrokes, technical mastery, aggressive return of serve, athleticism, and mental strength, Williams has been described as one of the most complete players on tour, and one of the greatest players of all time, irrespective of gender.[322]Williams has stated that her favourite surface is clay, as the slow pace and high bounce afforded aids point construction, although she also excels on faster hard and grass courts.[323]RivalriesSerena vs. VenusMain article:Williams sisters rivalryWilliams played older sisterVenusin 31 professional matches since 1998.[54]Overall, Serena is 19–12 against her sister.[54]Serena played Venus 15 times in Grand Slam singles and 13 times in other tournaments (including 11 finals).[324]They have met in nine Grand Slam tournament finals, with Serena winning seven times.[54]Beginning with the2002 French Open, they played each other in four consecutive Grand Slam finals, which was the first time in the Open Era that the same two players had contested four consecutive finals in Grand Slam singles.[325]Williams vs. HingisMain article:Hingis–S. Williams rivalryWilliams leads the series 7–6.[326]One of Williams's first rivalries was with Martina Hingis, who turned pro less than one year before her (Hingis in October 1994, Williams in 1995). They first played each other at the 1998 Miami Open where Hingis won in three sets. All but one of their matches was played on a hard court with the exception being a contest on clay in Rome 1999, which Hingis won in straight sets. Their last match took place at the 2002 Miami Open with Williams winning in a loss of just four games.[327]Hingis was forced to briefly retire citing ankle injuries.[328]Williams vs. CapriatiWilliams leads the series againstJennifer Capriati10–7.[329]Once considered one of the best rivalries in women's tennis,[330]the competition between Williams and Capriati was stiff with 12 out of 17 meetings going three sets. The rivalry, starting in 1999, began one sided with Capriati winning four of their first five matches. Williams would then go on to win the next eight.[329]Williams and Capriati played with similar styles, both known for using their power and athleticism to gain quick advantages in points.[331][332]Williams vs. HeninMain article:Henin–S. Williams rivalryWilliams leads the series 8–6.Justine Heninand Williams met 14 times, five of which were in tournament finals. In majors they have faced each other seven times with Henin leading 4–3.[333]Opposite personalities and styles of play are often cited as what made their rivalry entertaining.[334][335]In the semifinals of the2003 French Open, when at 4–2, 30–0 on Williams's serve in the third set, Henin raised her hand to indicate she was not ready to receive; Williams then put her serve into the net. The umpire did not see Henin raise her hand, and thus did not allow Williams a first serve. Williams lost the game and would go on to lose the match. Their last match took place in the final of the2010 Australian Openwhere Williams won in three sets to take her 12th major title.[333]Williams vs. AzarenkaWilliams leads the series 18–5. The rivalry began at the 2008 Australian Open, and their most recent match was in the semifinals of the 2020 US Open. Williams holds a 10–1 record in Grand Slams. Azarenka is the only person to ever win four WTA tour level finals against Williams.[336]While their rivalry is heavily favored towards Williams, their matches are known for their fierce competitiveness, and Azarenka is considered the only player to truly challenge Williams following the retirement of Capriati, Henin, and Hingis, with 9 of their matches extending to three sets.[337]Williams vs. SharapovaWilliams leads the series 20–2. The pair first met in the fourth round of the2004 Miami Open, where Williams defeated Sharapova 6–4, 6–3. Their rivalry truly began at the2004 Wimbledon final, where Williams was the two-time defending champion; Sharapova upset her 6–1, 6–4. Williams next lost to Sharapova in the finals of the2004 WTA Tour Championships, 6–4, 2–6, 4–6. Since then, however, Williams dominated the rivalry, winning all of their clashes, with only three of their matches going to three sets. They met 10 times in Grand Slam tournaments, where Williams led 9–1, and they further met in 9 finals, with Williams leading 7–2. Sharapova retired in February 2020, with their final match being in the first round of the2019 US Open; Williams defeated Sharapova 6–1, 6–1 in one hour exactly. Despite the one-sided nature of their rivalry, it is considered one of the most prominent rivalries on the WTA Tour of the 21st century, due to alleged personality clashes, similarly aggressive playing styles, and significant media interest.[338]Match controversiesAccusations of match fixingWhen both of the Williams sisters entered the top ten and started meeting in tournaments, rumors ofmatch fixingstarted to circulate.John McEnroe, while commenting on the 2000 Wimbledon semifinal between the two sisters, said that "Serena may not be allowed to win. Richard [Williams] may have something to say about this."[339]After losing to Venus at the Indian Wells quarterfinals in 2001,Elena Dementievaasserted during a post-match interview that Richard Williams decided the results of matches between the two sisters.[340]Shortly after that, Venus Williams pulled out of her Indian Wells semifinal match against Serena Williams at the last minute, claimingtendinitis; this occurrence garnered much speculation in the press, and some fans demanded their money back.[341][342][343]Indian Wells boycottAt the 2001 Ericsson Open the following week, Richard Williams stated that racist comments were made to him in the stands,[344]and the tournament director refused to offer Williams an apology for how he was treated.[citation needed]As a result, neither sister played the tournament even though it had become a mandatory stop on the WTA tour since 2009. In 2015, Williams decided to end her 14-year boycott and played.[345]2004 US OpenIn herUS Openquarterfinal match againstJennifer Capriati, an incorrect overrule was made by chair umpireMariana Alves; the video review showed that Williams's shot landed in bounds. In the same match, new technology being tested made incorrect line calls late in the third set. Williams argued with the chair over a couple of calls during the match, but was not successful. Capriati won the match, with Serena herself acknowledging that this was primarily due to her 57 unforced errors; nevertheless, she accused Alves of temporary insanity[346]and said that she "felt cheated".[347]In a post-match interview Capriati sharply observed that bad calls had gone against her in the past as well. Alves did not officiate for the remainder of the tournament; this was not punitive, as commonly thought, as she was not scheduled to officiate.[348]The controversy renewed calls for, and was widely given credit for, the adoption of technology such as theMacCAMandHawk-Eyesystems.[349]2009 US OpenIn theUS Opensemifinal round againstKim Clijsters, Williams slammed her racket on the court after losing the first set. She was given a warning, with a potential second violation carrying a one-point penalty. While trailing 4–6, 5–6, 15–30, Williams's second serve was called afoot fault, resulting in two match points for Clijsters. Williams gestured with her racket to the lineswoman who had made the call and yelled at her, with profanities and a threat to shove a tennis ball down the lineswoman's throat.[350]During the subsequent on-court conference between the chair umpire, the lineswoman, US Open officials, and Williams, a television microphone picked up Williams saying to the lineswoman, "I didn't say I would kill you! Are you serious?"[351]The incident resulted in Williams being penalized a point for unsportsmanlike conduct‍—‌necessitated by the earlier warning for racket abuse‍—‌meaning Clijsters won the match 6–4, 7–5. The following day, Williams was issued the maximum permissible on-site fine of $10,000 (plus $500 for racket abuse). After further investigation, the Grand Slam Committee in November 2009 fined her $175,000 in place of suspending her from the 2010 US Open or other Grand Slam events.[352]They also placed her on a two-year probation which provided that if Williams committed another offense at a Grand Slam event in the next two years, she would be suspended from participating in the following US Open. If, however, she committed no offenses within the next two years, her fine would be reduced to $82,500.[352]Williams initially refused to apologize for her outburst, both in her post-match press conference[353]and in an official statement released the following day.[124]She eventually did apologize, stating "I just really wanted to apologize sincerely because I'm a very prideful person, and I'm a very intense person and a very emotional person", and "I wanted to offer my sincere apologies to anyone that I may have offended." She said she was humbled by the experience.[354]2011 US OpenIn the final of the2011 US OpenagainstSamantha Stosur, Williams shouted "Come on!" as the Australian attempted to return aforehandWilliams believed to be a winner. The chair umpireEva Asderakiawarded the point to Stosur based on theITF's deliberate hindrance rule, which states, "If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if involuntary, the point shall be replayed."[355]As the point was 30–40 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur. Williams became angry with the chair umpire and made several gestures and unflattering comments toward her during the next changeover, including telling Asderaki that if the umpire ever saw Serena coming toward her, she should "look the other way".[356]Williams initially gained momentum in the set following the penalty, breaking back in the next game, but eventually flagged and lost the match, 2–6, 3–6. At the end of the match, she declined to offer the customary handshake to Asderaki.[357][358]Williams mentioned the incident in her post-match speech as the tournament runner-up, asserting, "I hit a winner, but I guess it didn't count", but added, "It wouldn't have mattered in the end. Sam played well."[359]A writer forESPNsuggested that Williams could avoid being found to have violated the terms of the "probation" on which she was placed following her 2009 outburst, as she did not appear to have usedprofanityin addressing Asderaki during the match.[360]In the end, Williams was fined $2,000 and was not barred from competing in the2012 US Openbecause "Williams' conduct, while verbally abusive, does not rise to the level of a major offense under the Grand Slam Code of Conduct."[361]2018 US OpenWilliams's2018 US Openended in controversy with Williams falling toNaomi Osakain straight sets following a game penalty in the second set of thefinal. During that second set, she was given a code violation because her coach,Patrick Mouratoglou, gave her coaching hand signals. Williams was upset by the violation, claiming that her coach was simply giving her a thumbs up, and demanded an apology from chair umpireCarlos Ramos. Mouratoglou later admitted that he was coaching.[362]She received a second violation for smashing her racket on the court, which resulted in a point penalty. After her third code violation for verbal abuse against the umpire, Williams was assessed a game penalty.[363][364]Williams said that she believed she was treated unfairly by the umpire because she is a woman.[365]Williams was fined a total of $17,000 including $4,000 for a coaching violation, $3,000 for racket abuse and $10,000 for verbal abuse towards the umpire.[366]Other issuesIn the beginning years of Williams' professional career, hair beads donned by the Williams sisters were the focus of discussion by commentators such as Chris Evert and John McEnroe, with Mary Carillo characterizing their hair as "noisy and disruptive".[367]The beads often broke and scattered across the court. Scholar Nancy E. Spencer said that commentary that dismissed the Williams' cultural hairstyles served to"other"the sisters, particularly in the context of a white dominated sport where their appearance and specifically their physicality is a popular topic for discussion.[367]Following the match controversy at the 2018 US Open final between Williams and Naomi Osaka, the Melbourne newspaper theHerald Sunpublished a cartoon byMark Knightdepicting Williams having a tantrum and breaking her racket while the umpire asks her opponent to "just let her win".[368]The cartoon was widely criticized as racist and sexist, including by Williams's husband, Reddit co-founderAlexis Ohanian, and authorJ. K. Rowling.[369][370]Complaints centered around the portrayal of Williams as an angry black woman with exaggerated large lips, a broad flat nose, and positioned in an ape-like pose, and the portrayal of Williams's opponent, Osaka, who is half-Japanese, half-Haitian, with blonde hair.[371]The editor of the Herald Sun argued the cartoon was unfairly criticized on social media.[372]Knight defended his work, saying that his satire was never about race or gender, but was about putting a spotlight on bad behavior by sporting superstars. In the immediate aftermath of the controversy he suspended his Twitter account to "protect his family and friends".[372]In September 2019, Romanian television host Radu Banciu made the following comments during a live broadcast: "Serena Williams looks exactly like one of those monkeys at the zoo with the red asses."[373]Romania'sNational Council for Combating Discriminationfined Banciu approximately $1,875 for his comments.LegacyWilliams is considered one of the best female tennis players of all time. In 2017,BBC Sportusers picked Williams as the greatest female tennis player of the Open Era.

Williams(born September 26, 1981)[1]is an American inactive professionaltennisplayer. Considered among the greatest tennis players of all time,[a]she was rankedworld No. 1in singles by theWomen's Tennis Association(WTA) for 319 weeks, including a joint-record 186 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. She won 23Grand Slamsingles titles, the most by any player in theOpen Era, and thesecond-most of all time. She is the only player, male or female, to accomplish aCareer Golden Slamin both singles and doubles.[19]Along with her older sisterVenus, Serena Williams was coached by her parentsOracene PriceandRichard Williams. Turning professional in 1995, she won her first major singles title at the1999 US Open. From the2002 French Opento the2003 Australian Open, she was dominant, winning all four major singles titles (each time over Venus in the final) to achieve anon-calendar year Grand Slamand thecareer Grand Slam, known as the 'Serena Slam'. The next few years saw her claim two more singles majors, but suffer from injury and decline in form. Beginning in 2007, however, she gradually returned to form despite continued injuries, retaking the world No. 1 singles ranking. Beginning at the2012 Wimbledon Championships, Williams returned to dominance, claimingOlympic gold(completing the Career Golden Slam in singles)[20]and winning eight out of thirteen singles majors, including all four in a row from 2014–15 to achieve a second "Serena Slam". At the2017 Australian Open, she won her 23rd major singles title, surpassingSteffi Graf's Open Era record. She then took a break from professional tennis after becoming pregnant and reached four major finals upon returning to play. In August 2022, Williams announced her impending "evolution" away from professional tennis and played what was expected to be her final match at the2022 US Open.[21]Williams also won 14 major women's doubles titles, all with her sister Venus, and the pair was unbeaten in major doubles finals (the best unbeaten record in major finals in any discipline of the sport).[22][23]The pair achieved a non-calendar year Grand Slam between the2009 Wimbledon Championshipsand the2010 French Open, which granted the sisters thedoubles world No. 1 ranking. Serena won fourOlympic gold medals, three in women's doubles—an all-time joint record in tennis, shared with her sister.[24][25]The duo are the only women in the Open Era to win Olympic gold in both singles and doubles.[26]She also won two major mixed doubles titles, both in 1998. She is the only singles player, male or female, to complete three Career Golden Slams – one in women's singles and two in same-sex doubles.[19]The arrival of theWilliams sistershas been credited with ushering in a new era of power and athleticism on the women's professional tennis tour.[27][28][29][30]Serena holds a combined 39 major titles: 23 in singles, 14 in women's doubles, and two in mixed doubles. She isjoint-third on the all-time listand second in the Open Era for total major titles. She is the most recent woman to simultaneously hold all four major singles titles (2002–03 and 2014–15), and the most recent woman to win theSurface Slam(major titles onhard,clayandgrasscourts in the same calendar year), doing so in 2015. She is also, with Venus, the most recent player to have simultaneously held all four major women's doubles titles (2009–10).Williams was the world's highest paid woman athlete in 2016, earning almost $29 million.[31]She repeated this feat in 2017 when she was the only woman onForbes'list of the 100 highest-paid athletes, with $27million in prize money and endorsements. She won theLaureus Sportswoman of the Yearaward a record four times (2003, 2010, 2016, 2018), and in December 2015 was namedSportsperson of the YearbySports Illustratedmagazine.[32]She is the highest-earning woman athlete of all time.[33]Early lifeWilliams was born on September 26, 1981, inSaginaw, MichigantoOracene PriceandRichard Williams. She is the youngest of Price's five daughters: half-sistersYetunde, Lyndrea, and Isha Price, and full older sisterVenus.[1]She also has at least seven paternal half-siblings.[34][35]When the children were young, the family moved toCompton, California, where she started playing tennis at age four.[36][37]Her father home-schooled her and her sister, Venus.[38][39]While he and subsequently her mother have been their official coaches, her other mentors have included Richard Williams, a Compton man who shared her father's name and subsequently founded The Venus and Serena Williams Tennis Tutorial Academy.[40]Williams sisters at aPam Shriverevent in Baltimore, 1993When Williams was nine, she and her family moved from Compton toWest Palm Beach, Florida[36]so she could attend the tennis academy ofRick Macci, who provided her with additional coaching. Macci did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls".[41]Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, as he wanted them to "go slowly" and focus on school work. Experiences of racism also influenced this decision, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments.[42]At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on theUnited States Tennis Associationjunior tour and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida.[43]In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether it would have been more beneficial for them to have followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit, Williams responded, "Everyone does different things. I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us."[43]Professional career1995–1998: Professional debutWilliams' parents wanted their daughter to wait until she was 16 to participate in professional tournaments.[44]In 1995, just after turning 14, Williams planned to make her professional debut as awild-cardentry in theBank of the West ClassicinOakland, California, but was denied by the WTA owing to their age-eligibility restrictions.[45]She subsequently filed an antitrust lawsuit against the women's tour, but withdrew it at her parents' request.[45]Her first professional event was in October 1995 at theBell ChallengeinQuebec,[44][46]where she used a wild-card entry to circumvent age-eligibility rules.[44]She lost in the first qualifying round to then 18-year-old AmericanAnnie Miller, winning just two games.[47]Williams did not play a tournament in 1996. The next year, she lost in the qualifying rounds of three tournaments,[48]before winning her first main-draw match in November at theAmeritech Cup Chicago.[49]Ranked No. 304, she upset No. 7Mary Pierce, and No. 4Monica Seles,[50][51]recording her first career wins over top10 players and becoming the lowest-ranked player in the Open Era to defeat two top-10 opponents in one tournament.[1]She ultimately lost in the semifinals to No. 5Lindsay Davenport.[52]She finished 1997 ranked No. 99.[53]Williams began 1998 at theMedibank International Sydney.[54]As a qualifier ranked No. 96,[55]she defeated No. 3 Davenport in the quarterfinals,[55]before losing toArantxa Sánchez Vicarioin the semifinals.[56]Williams made her debut in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament at theAustralian Open,[57]where she defeated sixth-seededIrina Spîrleain the first round,[58]before losing to her sister, Venus, in the second round in the sisters' first professional match.[58][54]She reached six other quarterfinals during the year, but lost all of them,[59]including her first match against No. 1-rankedMartina Hingisat theLipton International Players Championshipsin Key Biscayne,[60]and her second match against Venus at theItalian Openin Rome.[59]She failed to reach the quarterfinals of any Grand Slam tournament the remainder of the year,[citation needed]losing in the fourth round of the French Open to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario,[61]and the third round of theUS Opento Spîrlea.[62]She withdrew fromWimbledontwo games into a match withVirginia Ruano Pascual, after straining a calf muscle during the first set.[63]She did win the mixed doubles titles atWimbledonand theUS OpenwithMax Mirnyi, completing the Williams family's sweep of the 1998 mixed doubles Grand Slam tournaments. She won her first professional title in doubles at theU.S. National Indoor Championshipsin Oklahoma City with Venus, becoming the third pair of sisters to win a WTA title.[1]They won two more doubles titles that year. Williams finished the year ranked No. 20 in singles.[citation needed]Battle of the sexes: Karsten Braasch vs. the Williams sistersMain article:Battle of the Sexes (tennis)A 16-year-old Serena and her sister Venus competed in a tennis "Battle of the Sexes" againstKarsten Braaschat the 1998 Australian Open.[64]At the time Braasch was 203rd in the ATP rankings. The sisters had claimed they could beat any man outside the top 200, and accepted his challenge. Braasch beat both of them, playing one set against each. The score versus Serena was 6–1 and 6–2 against Venus.[65]Braasch said afterward, "500 and above, no chance." The sisters later tweaked the number to beating men outside the top 350.[66]1999–2001: Becoming a top-10 playerWilliams lost in the third round of the1999 Australian OpentoSandrine Testud. A month later, Williams won her first professional singles title when she defeatedAmélie Mauresmoin the final of theOpen Gaz de Francein Paris. With Venus also winning theIGA Superthrift Classicin Memphis, Tennessee, that day, the pair became the first sisters to win professional tournaments in the same week.[67]In March of that year, at theEvert Cupin California, Williams won her firstTier Ititle, defeatingSteffi Grafin the final. Soon afterward at theMiami Masters, Williams had her 16-match winning streak ended by her sister in the first all-sister singles final in WTA history,[54]and she then made her top-10 debut, at No. 9. She then lost in the quarterfinals of theItalian Open[68]and theGerman Open,[69]and the third round of theFrench Open,[70]where she and Venus won the women's doubles title.[54]Williams then missedWimbledonbecause of injury. When she returned to the tour, Williams won aFed Cupsingles match and then won theJPMorgan Chase Openin Los Angeles, beatingJulie Halard-Decugisin the final. She then defeated in succession Grand Slam championsKim Clijsters,Conchita Martínez,Monica Seles, and defending champion Lindsay Davenport to reach theUS Openfinal, where she defeated No. 1, Hingis, to become the second African-American woman, afterAlthea Gibsonin 1958, to win a Grand Slam singles tournament.[1]The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at this tournament. To complete her 1999 season, Williams won a doubles match in the Fed Cup final against Russia. Williams ended the year ranked No. 4 in just her second full year on the main tour.[71]Williams started 2000 by losing in the fourth round of theAustralian OpentoElena Likhovtseva. She failed to defend her titles in Paris and Indian Wells, although she did win theFaber Grand Prixin Germany. Soon afterwards, Williams missed theFrench Openbecause of injury. She returned from injury at theWimbledon Championships, where she lost to Venus in the semifinals, but the pair won the doubles title at the event. Williams successfully defended her title in Los Angeles, defeating Davenport in the final. She reached the final of theDu Maurier Openwhere an injury forced her to retire from her match with Hingis. Her defense of theUS Opentitle ended when she lost in the quarterfinals to Davenport. Williams teamed with Venus to win the gold medal in doubles at theSydney Olympicsthat September. She ended the year winning theToyota Princess Cupin Japan and she finished the year ranked No. 6.[citation needed]Williams began 2001 losing to Martina Hingis in the quarterfinals of the Medibank International inSydneyand the Australian Open in Melbourne. Williams and her sister won the doubles title at the latter tournament, becoming only the fifth doubles team in history to win all four Grand Slam women's doubles titles during their career, completing a "Career Grand Slam". Her next event was thePacific Life Openin California, where she defeated Kim Clijsters in the final. The final was marred by the behavior of the crowd toward Williams and her family. Crowd members were incensed at the perceived match-fixing of games involving the family afterVenus withdrewbefore their semifinal. Neither Williams nor her sister entered the tournament for fourteen years until Williams entered in 2015 as a wildcard (and the top seed).[72]The following week at theEricsson Openin Miami, Williams lost toJennifer Capriatiin the quarterfinals. She then lost in the quarterfinals to Capriati at both theFrench OpenandWimbledon Championships. That was the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament at which Williams had exited in the quarterfinals. During the North American hard-court season, she lost in the quarterfinals ofLos Angelesagainst Monica Seles, then captured her second title of the year at theRogers Cup, defeating Capriati in the final. Williams reached the final of the 2001 US Open, losing to sister Venus. That was the first Grand Slam tournament final contested by two sisters during the Open Era. At the 2001 season-endingTour Championships, Williams won the championship by walkover when Davenport withdrew before the start of the final because of a knee injury. Williams finished 2001 at No. 6 for the second straight year.[citation needed]2002–2003: "Serena Slam"Early 2002, injury saw Williams retire from the semifinal at theMedibank International Sydneyand later withdraw from theAustralian Open.[73]Playing Amélie Mauresmo in the quarterfinals of the tournament in Sydney in 2002Returning from injury, Williams won her first title of the year inScottsdale, Arizona, defeating No. 2 Jennifer Capriati, in the final. She then won the Miami Masters for the first time, becoming one of three players in the Open Era to defeat the world's top 3 ranked players at one tournament,[1]after beating No. 3, Martina Hingis, in the quarterfinals, No. 2 Venus in the semifinals, and the top-ranked player, Capriati, in the final. Serena's straight set win over Venus was her second career win over her sister.[citation needed]Williams played three clay-court tournaments before the2002 French Open. Her first tournament was atCharleston, where she was the third seed. Williams reached the quarterfinals before losing toPatty Schnyder. She reached her first clay-court final in May, at theEurocard German Openlosing toJustine Heninin a third set tiebreak. Williams went on to win her first clay court title at theItalian Open, defeating Capriati in the semifinals and Henin in the final.[74]This raised her ranking to a new high of No. 3. Williams was the third seed at the French Open at Roland Garros, where she claimed her first title thereby defeating defending champion Capriati in the semifinals and sister Venus in the final to win her second Grand Slam tournament title (and her first in two-and-a-half years). As a result of raising the trophy atCourt Philippe Chatrier, Williams rose to a career-high of No. 2, second only to Venus.[citation needed]At the2002 Wimbledon Championships, Williams won tennis's oldest championship for the first time in her life, defeating Venus to win a Grand Slam singles title without dropping a set for the first time in her career. This victory earned Williams the world No. 1 ranking for the first time, dethroning her sister and becoming only the third African American woman to hold that ranking.[1]The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at the tournament, the fifth Grand Slam doubles title for the pair. Williams played just one tournament between Wimbledon and theUS Open, losing in the quarterfinals of theJPMorgan Chase Openin Los Angeles to AmericanChanda Rubinand ending a 21-match winning streak. The top-seeded player at the US Open, Williams reached the final where, for the third Grand Slam in a row, she defeated her sister to win the title, the second US Open crown of her career. Williams won two consecutive singles titles in the fall, defeating Kim Clijsters to win theToyota Princess Cupin Tokyo, andAnastasia Myskinato win theSparkassen Cupin Leipzig, Germany. She reached the final at the year-endHome Depot Championshipsat theStaples Centerin Los Angeles, where she lost to fifth-seeded Clijsters in straight sets, ending an 18-match winning streak.[citation needed]Williams finished 2002 with a 56–5 W/L record, eight singles titles, and the No. 1 ranking. She was the first African-American to end a year with that ranking sinceAlthea Gibsonin 1958[citation needed]and was the first woman to win three Grand Slam tournament titles in one year since Hingis in 1997.[1]Her three consecutive Grand Slam titles to close 2002 also made Williams only the third player in tennis history to win the "Surface Slam",[75]three Slam titles on three surfaces in the same calendar year, after Navratilova (1984) and Graf (1993, 1995, 1996).[citation needed]At the2003 Australian Open, Williams reached the tournament's semifinals for the first time, where she recovered from 5–1 down in the third set and saved two match points before defeating Clijsters. In the final, Serena faced Venus for the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament final, defeating her older sister to become the sixth woman in the Open Era to complete a career Grand Slam, alongsideMargaret Court,Billie Jean King,Chris Evert,Martina Navratilova, andSteffi Graf. She also became the fifth woman to hold all Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously, joiningMaureen Connolly Brinker, Court, Graf, and Navratilova. This feat was dubbed the "Serena Slam" by the press.[76][77]TheWilliams sisterswon their sixth Grand Slam doubles title together at this event.[78]During the spring of 2003, Williams captured the singles titles at theOpen Gaz de Franceand theSony Ericsson Open. Williams's winning streak came to an end when she lost the final of theFamily Circle Cupto Henin, her first loss of the year after 21 wins. She also lost to Mauresmo in the semifinals of theInternazionali BNL d'Italiain Rome. Despite these losses, Williams was the top seed at theFrench Open, where she lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Henin, marking Williams's first loss in a Grand Slam tournament since 2001. The match was controversial, as Williams questioned Henin's sportsmanship, and spectators applauded Williams's errors.[79]Williams rebounded from the French Open loss a couple weeks later at the2003 Wimbledon Championships, defeating Henin in the semifinals and Venus in the final. This was Williams's second consecutive Wimbledon title and her sixth Grand Slam singles title overall. Wimbledon was Williams's last tournament of 2003; she pulled out of three events in the US and then underwent surgery on the quadriceps tendon in her knee in early August. Williams was initially expected to be out for six to eight weeks.[80]2004–2007: Injuries and the comebackMain articles:2004,2005,2006, and2007 Serena Williams tennis seasonAfter eight months away from the tour, during which time her desire was questioned,[81]Williams began her comeback at the 2004NASDAQ-100 Openin Miami in March, where she made a triumphant return as she won the title for the third consecutive year.Delivering a serve at an exhibition in November 2004Although ranked No. 7, Williams was seeded second at the French Open, where, after winning four matches, she lost to Capriati in the quarterfinals. That was the first time that Williams had lost before the semifinals at a Grand Slam singles tournament since Wimbledon in 2001. A few weeks later, even though her ranking had dropped to No. 10, Williams was seeded first atWimbledon. She won six matches en route to the final, where 13th-seededMaria Sharapovadefeated her in straight sets. This loss caused her ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the first time since 1999. Later that summer, Williams reached her third final of the year at the JPMorgan Chase Open in Los Angeles where she lost to Lindsay Davenport which was her first loss to the American since the 2000 US Open. After missing her national championship in 2003, Williams returned for the2004 US Open, where she was seeded third despite her No. 11 ranking. She lost in the U.S. Open quarterfinals to Capriati in three sets in controversial fashion.[82]That fall, Williams won her second title of the year, at theChina Open, defeating US Open championSvetlana Kuznetsovain the final. Williams's successful season allowed her to qualify for theTour Championships, held again in Los Angeles. In the round-robin phase of the tournament, Williams defeated Dementieva andAnastasia Myskinaand lost to Davenport, but still advanced to the elimination stage. After winning her semifinal, she lost to Sharapova in the final, where she suffered an abdominal injury.[83]Williams finished 2004 ranked No. 7, but did not win a Grand Slam singles tournament for the first season since 2001.[citation needed]At the2005 Australian Open, Williams rejected suggestions that she and sister Venus were a declining force in tennis, following Venus's early exit.[84]Williams saved three match points to defeat Sharapova 8–6 in the third of their semifinal. In the final, Williams defeated top seed Davenport to win her second Australian Open and seventh Grand Slam singles title, winning 12 of the last 15 games.[85]The win moved Williams back to No. 2 but stated she was targeting the top spot.[86]Williams completed just two tournaments between the Australian Open and Wimbledon, losing to Venus in Miami and at Internazionali BNL d'Italia toFrancesca Schiavoneas Williams suffered a series of retirements and withdraws.[87][88]A reoccurring ankle injury causing her to miss theFrench Open.[89]She returned forWimbledonas the 4th-seeded player, but was defeated in the third round by No. 85,Jill Craybas. At theUS Open, Williams lost to her sister Venus in the fourth round. This was the earliest the sisters had met in a Grand Slam tournament since their first meeting, at the 1998 Australian Open. Williams played just one more match that fall, a loss to No. 127Sun Tiantianat thetournament in Beijing. She failed to qualify for the year-end championship for the first time since 1998 and she finished the year 2005 ranked No. 11, her first time finishing the season outside the top 10 since 1998.[citation needed]Williams made her 2006 debut at theAustralian Open. Defending the title, Williams lost toDaniela Hantuchováin the third round.[90]After the tournament, she told the press that she was injured, blaming a lack of fitness and a knee injury for keeping her off the court.[91]In her biography, Williams claims that she was actually suffering from depression. She stayed away from pro tennis for six months during the 2006 season. After she had shut herself off from the world for a period, Williams saw a therapist daily.[92]After a chance meeting with a young girl who idolized Williams and believed that she could still win, Williams signed up to play in Cincinnati,[93]her first tournament since Melbourne. Williams had slipped to No. 139, the lowest ranking she had held since 1997.

With a world ranking at the time of 181,[257]many felt that the decision showed bias and favored Williams unduly.[258]Others argued that theAll England Club, who do not base their seedings on players' current world rankings – as other grand slam tournaments do– had sensibly considered Williams's excellent historic record there. Williams herself said: "I was pleasantly surprised. I came in here expecting that maybe I wouldn't get a seed."[258]Her seeding resulted inDominika Cibulkoválosing her place to be seeded.[citation needed]By the second week of the tournament, for the first time in grand slam history, none of the top ten seeded women players had made it to the quarterfinals.[259]En route to the quarterfinals, Williams had beatenArantxa Rusof Holland in round one,Viktoriya Tomovaof Bulgaria in round 2,Kristina Mladenovicof France in round 3 andEvgeniya Rodinaof Russia in round 4.[260]She had not lost a set in any of her matches till then.

This was Williams's earliest defeat at the Australian Open since her fourth-round loss in2014, and broke a streak of fourteen consecutive match wins in Grand Slam quarterfinals (having last lost a Grand Slam quarterfinal at the2013 Australian Open).

In her announcement she said that she disliked the word "retirement" and preferred the term "evolution".[298]She went on to cite growing her family, focusing on her venture capital firm, and spending more time with family as reasons she would be leaving the sport.

Owing to her high-risk playing style, she typically hits a large number of both winners and unforced errors. Williams' greatest asset is her serve, which is considered the greatest in the history of women's tennis. Her serve is known for its fast pace and accurate placement, allowing her to serve numerous aces: at the2013 Australian Open, she served a 128.6 mph (207 km/h) ace in her third round match againstAyumi Morita, which is the third fastest serve recorded in WTA history.[305]Williams possesses an accurate and consistent ball toss, allowing her to serve to any position on the court with minimal differences in the position of the ball in the air; this makes it difficult for opponents to read her service motion and predict the position of her serve, allowing her to dominate a rally from the first stroke.[306]Williams also possesses effective and accurate kick and slice serves, which she deploys as second serves, minimizing double faults, and preventing opponents from scoring free points.[307]Williams is also known for her forceful groundstrokes, which are considered two of the most powerful shots in the history of women's tennis.[308]She hits both her forehand and her backhand in an open stance, allowing her to generate consistently powerful, heavy, and dominating groundstrokes, and to generate sharp, acute angles, which allow her to hit winners from any position on the court.[309]Williams is known for her forehand, which has been described as "devastating".[310]Her forehand is hit with heavy topspin; this allows her to dominate rallies, and she is capable of hitting her forehand both crosscourt and down the line to produce winners.[311]Her two-handed backhand is equally dominant, and has been described as one of the greatest backhands of all time.[312]Williams tends to hit her backhand flatter than her forehand, allowing her to hit her backhand with speed, power, and depth both crosscourt and down the line. Despite playing primarily from the baseline, Williams is an adept net player thanks to her extensive doubles experience, and will frequently choose to finish points at the net, either with deft touch, aggressive drive volleys, or a solid, powerful, and reliable overhead smash.[313]Williams possesses an aggressive return of serve – she neutralizes powerful first serves, and attacks weak second serves. She is widely considered one of the greatest return players of all time.[314]Despite predominantly employing an aggressive game style, she is also an excellent defender, and is capable of counterpunching against aggressive opponents until she creates an opportunity to hit a winner. She is an exceptional athlete, known for her movement, speed, court coverage, agility, flexibility, balance, and footwork. Her on-court intelligence, shot selection, and point construction allow her to execute her gamestyle effectively.[315]She has been praised for her mental strength and competitive spirit, with her being described as one of the toughest opponents to beat on the court;Martina Navratilovadeclared her mental strength "unbelievable",[316]whilst tennis journalistJon Wertheimclaimed that Williams is the toughest player of all time.[317]American tennis playerChristina McHalepraised her composure in high pressure moments, stating that, for Williams, "being clutch is like breathing", and that she "seems to come through every single time in the most pressure-packed situations".[318]She has been noted for her ability to produce extraordinary comebacks, particularly on the Grand Slam level, winning three Slams after saving match points, a feat achieved more often than by any other player in tennis history.[319]Williams bounced back from a set down to win 37 Grand Slam matches; her ability to come back from set and break deficits in Grand Slam matches was described byJohn McEnroeas "a gift", and McEnroe declared that she was "the greatest" competitor in the history of women's tennis.[320]She has also been praised for her ability to serve aces at critical moments. As noted by retired playerLi Nain 2016, "break point down, [there is an] 80% chance [she] serves an ace".[321]Owing to her exceptional serve, powerful groundstrokes, technical mastery, aggressive return of serve, athleticism, and mental strength, Williams has been described as one of the most complete players on tour, and one of the greatest players of all time, irrespective of gender.[322]Williams has stated that her favourite surface is clay, as the slow pace and high bounce afforded aids point construction, although she also excels on faster hard and grass courts.[323]RivalriesSerena vs. VenusMain article:Williams sisters rivalryWilliams played older sisterVenusin 31 professional matches since 1998.[54]Overall, Serena is 19–12 against her sister.[54]Serena played Venus 15 times in Grand Slam singles and 13 times in other tournaments (including 11 finals).[324]They have met in nine Grand Slam tournament finals, with Serena winning seven times.[54]Beginning with the2002 French Open, they played each other in four consecutive Grand Slam finals, which was the first time in the Open Era that the same two players had contested four consecutive finals in Grand Slam singles.[325]Williams vs. HingisMain article:Hingis–S. Williams rivalryWilliams leads the series 7–6.[326]One of Williams's first rivalries was with Martina Hingis, who turned pro less than one year before her (Hingis in October 1994, Williams in 1995). They first played each other at the 1998 Miami Open where Hingis won in three sets. All but one of their matches was played on a hard court with the exception being a contest on clay in Rome 1999, which Hingis won in straight sets. Their last match took place at the 2002 Miami Open with Williams winning in a loss of just four games.[327]Hingis was forced to briefly retire citing ankle injuries.[328]Williams vs. CapriatiWilliams leads the series againstJennifer Capriati10–7.[329]Once considered one of the best rivalries in women's tennis,[330]the competition between Williams and Capriati was stiff with 12 out of 17 meetings going three sets. The rivalry, starting in 1999, began one sided with Capriati winning four of their first five matches. Williams would then go on to win the next eight.[329]Williams and Capriati played with similar styles, both known for using their power and athleticism to gain quick advantages in points.[331][332]Williams vs. HeninMain article:Henin–S. Williams rivalryWilliams leads the series 8–6.Justine Heninand Williams met 14 times, five of which were in tournament finals. In majors they have faced each other seven times with Henin leading 4–3.[333]Opposite personalities and styles of play are often cited as what made their rivalry entertaining.[334][335]In the semifinals of the2003 French Open, when at 4–2, 30–0 on Williams's serve in the third set, Henin raised her hand to indicate she was not ready to receive; Williams then put her serve into the net. The umpire did not see Henin raise her hand, and thus did not allow Williams a first serve. Williams lost the game and would go on to lose the match. Their last match took place in the final of the2010 Australian Openwhere Williams won in three sets to take her 12th major title.[333]Williams vs. AzarenkaWilliams leads the series 18–5. The rivalry began at the 2008 Australian Open, and their most recent match was in the semifinals of the 2020 US Open. Williams holds a 10–1 record in Grand Slams. Azarenka is the only person to ever win four WTA tour level finals against Williams.[336]While their rivalry is heavily favored towards Williams, their matches are known for their fierce competitiveness, and Azarenka is considered the only player to truly challenge Williams following the retirement of Capriati, Henin, and Hingis, with 9 of their matches extending to three sets.[337]Williams vs. SharapovaWilliams leads the series 20–2. The pair first met in the fourth round of the2004 Miami Open, where Williams defeated Sharapova 6–4, 6–3. Their rivalry truly began at the2004 Wimbledon final, where Williams was the two-time defending champion; Sharapova upset her 6–1, 6–4. Williams next lost to Sharapova in the finals of the2004 WTA Tour Championships, 6–4, 2–6, 4–6. Since then, however, Williams dominated the rivalry, winning all of their clashes, with only three of their matches going to three sets. They met 10 times in Grand Slam tournaments, where Williams led 9–1, and they further met in 9 finals, with Williams leading 7–2. Sharapova retired in February 2020, with their final match being in the first round of the2019 US Open; Williams defeated Sharapova 6–1, 6–1 in one hour exactly. Despite the one-sided nature of their rivalry, it is considered one of the most prominent rivalries on the WTA Tour of the 21st century, due to alleged personality clashes, similarly aggressive playing styles, and significant media interest.[338]Match controversiesAccusations of match fixingWhen both of the Williams sisters entered the top ten and started meeting in tournaments, rumors ofmatch fixingstarted to circulate.John McEnroe, while commenting on the 2000 Wimbledon semifinal between the two sisters, said that "Serena may not be allowed to win. Richard [Williams] may have something to say about this."[339]After losing to Venus at the Indian Wells quarterfinals in 2001,Elena Dementievaasserted during a post-match interview that Richard Williams decided the results of matches between the two sisters.[340]Shortly after that, Venus Williams pulled out of her Indian Wells semifinal match against Serena Williams at the last minute, claimingtendinitis; this occurrence garnered much speculation in the press, and some fans demanded their money back.[341][342][343]Indian Wells boycottAt the 2001 Ericsson Open the following week, Richard Williams stated that racist comments were made to him in the stands,[344]and the tournament director refused to offer Williams an apology for how he was treated.[citation needed]As a result, neither sister played the tournament even though it had become a mandatory stop on the WTA tour since 2009. In 2015, Williams decided to end her 14-year boycott and played.[345]2004 US OpenIn herUS Openquarterfinal match againstJennifer Capriati, an incorrect overrule was made by chair umpireMariana Alves; the video review showed that Williams's shot landed in bounds. In the same match, new technology being tested made incorrect line calls late in the third set. Williams argued with the chair over a couple of calls during the match, but was not successful. Capriati won the match, with Serena herself acknowledging that this was primarily due to her 57 unforced errors; nevertheless, she accused Alves of temporary insanity[346]and said that she "felt cheated".[347]In a post-match interview Capriati sharply observed that bad calls had gone against her in the past as well. Alves did not officiate for the remainder of the tournament; this was not punitive, as commonly thought, as she was not scheduled to officiate.[348]The controversy renewed calls for, and was widely given credit for, the adoption of technology such as theMacCAMandHawk-Eyesystems.[349]2009 US OpenIn theUS Opensemifinal round againstKim Clijsters, Williams slammed her racket on the court after losing the first set. She was given a warning, with a potential second violation carrying a one-point penalty. While trailing 4–6, 5–6, 15–30, Williams's second serve was called afoot fault, resulting in two match points for Clijsters. Williams gestured with her racket to the lineswoman who had made the call and yelled at her, with profanities and a threat to shove a tennis ball down the lineswoman's throat.[350]During the subsequent on-court conference between the chair umpire, the lineswoman, US Open officials, and Williams, a television microphone picked up Williams saying to the lineswoman, "I didn't say I would kill you! Are you serious?"[351]The incident resulted in Williams being penalized a point for unsportsmanlike conduct‍—‌necessitated by the earlier warning for racket abuse‍—‌meaning Clijsters won the match 6–4, 7–5. The following day, Williams was issued the maximum permissible on-site fine of $10,000 (plus $500 for racket abuse). After further investigation, the Grand Slam Committee in November 2009 fined her $175,000 in place of suspending her from the 2010 US Open or other Grand Slam events.[352]They also placed her on a two-year probation which provided that if Williams committed another offense at a Grand Slam event in the next two years, she would be suspended from participating in the following US Open. If, however, she committed no offenses within the next two years, her fine would be reduced to $82,500.[352]Williams initially refused to apologize for her outburst, both in her post-match press conference[353]and in an official statement released the following day.[124]She eventually did apologize, stating "I just really wanted to apologize sincerely because I'm a very prideful person, and I'm a very intense person and a very emotional person", and "I wanted to offer my sincere apologies to anyone that I may have offended." She said she was humbled by the experience.[354]2011 US OpenIn the final of the2011 US OpenagainstSamantha Stosur, Williams shouted "Come on!" as the Australian attempted to return aforehandWilliams believed to be a winner. The chair umpireEva Asderakiawarded the point to Stosur based on theITF's deliberate hindrance rule, which states, "If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if involuntary, the point shall be replayed."[355]As the point was 30–40 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur. Williams became angry with the chair umpire and made several gestures and unflattering comments toward her during the next changeover, including telling Asderaki that if the umpire ever saw Serena coming toward her, she should "look the other way".[356]Williams initially gained momentum in the set following the penalty, breaking back in the next game, but eventually flagged and lost the match, 2–6, 3–6. At the end of the match, she declined to offer the customary handshake to Asderaki.[357][358]Williams mentioned the incident in her post-match speech as the tournament runner-up, asserting, "I hit a winner, but I guess it didn't count", but added, "It wouldn't have mattered in the end. Sam played well."[359]A writer forESPNsuggested that Williams could avoid being found to have violated the terms of the "probation" on which she was placed following her 2009 outburst, as she did not appear to have usedprofanityin addressing Asderaki during the match.[360]In the end, Williams was fined $2,000 and was not barred from competing in the2012 US Openbecause "Williams' conduct, while verbally abusive, does not rise to the level of a major offense under the Grand Slam Code of Conduct."[361]2018 US OpenWilliams's2018 US Openended in controversy with Williams falling toNaomi Osakain straight sets following a game penalty in the second set of thefinal. During that second set, she was given a code violation because her coach,Patrick Mouratoglou, gave her coaching hand signals. Williams was upset by the violation, claiming that her coach was simply giving her a thumbs up, and demanded an apology from chair umpireCarlos Ramos. Mouratoglou later admitted that he was coaching.[362]She received a second violation for smashing her racket on the court, which resulted in a point penalty. After her third code violation for verbal abuse against the umpire, Williams was assessed a game penalty.[363][364]Williams said that she believed she was treated unfairly by the umpire because she is a woman.[365]Williams was fined a total of $17,000 including $4,000 for a coaching violation, $3,000 for racket abuse and $10,000 for verbal abuse towards the umpire.[366]Other issuesIn the beginning years of Williams' professional career, hair beads donned by the Williams sisters were the focus of discussion by commentators such as Chris Evert and John McEnroe, with Mary Carillo characterizing their hair as "noisy and disruptive".[367]The beads often broke and scattered across the court. Scholar Nancy E. Spencer said that commentary that dismissed the Williams' cultural hairstyles served to"other"the sisters, particularly in the context of a white dominated sport where their appearance and specifically their physicality is a popular topic for discussion.[367]Following the match controversy at the 2018 US Open final between Williams and Naomi Osaka, the Melbourne newspaper theHerald Sunpublished a cartoon byMark Knightdepicting Williams having a tantrum and breaking her racket while the umpire asks her opponent to "just let her win".[368]The cartoon was widely criticized as racist and sexist, including by Williams's husband, Reddit co-founderAlexis Ohanian, and authorJ. K. Rowling.[369][370]Complaints centered around the portrayal of Williams as an angry black woman with exaggerated large lips, a broad flat nose, and positioned in an ape-like pose, and the portrayal of Williams's opponent, Osaka, who is half-Japanese, half-Haitian, with blonde hair.[371]The editor of the Herald Sun argued the cartoon was unfairly criticized on social media.[372]Knight defended his work, saying that his satire was never about race or gender, but was about putting a spotlight on bad behavior by sporting superstars. In the immediate aftermath of the controversy he suspended his Twitter account to "protect his family and friends".[372]In September 2019, Romanian television host Radu Banciu made the following comments during a live broadcast: "Serena Williams looks exactly like one of those monkeys at the zoo with the red asses."[373]Romania'sNational Council for Combating Discriminationfined Banciu approximately $1,875 for his comments.LegacyWilliams is considered one of the best female tennis players of all time. In 2017,BBC Sportusers picked Williams as the greatest female tennis player of the Open Era. BBC presenter and former French Open Champion,Sue Barker, said "Serena is the greatest because this era is so much more competitive than previous eras.

Just a huge impact that really can't be overstated. That attracted thousands of girls into the sport, not just African-American but all backgrounds and races.

With 23 Grand Slam titles, Williams rose from the public courts of Compton, California to shatter records and dominate the field.Serena Jameka Williams was born to parents Richard Williams and Oracene Price on September 26, 1981 in Saginaw, Michigan. Williams is the youngest of Price's five daughters, who include fellow tennis superstar Venus Williams. Richard Williams, a former sharecropper from Louisiana, was determined that daughters Serena and Venus would succeed in life. Seeing opportunity in tennis, he and Oracene taught themselves the game from books and videos so that they could coach their children. Richard moved the family to Compton, California, where Williams began intensive tennis training with her father and older sister around the age of three. The Williams sisters practiced for hours every day on rundown public tennis courts.Williams joined the junior United States Tennis Association tour and by 1991 she ranked first in the 10-and-under division. Richard then moved the family to Palm Beach, Florida, where the sisters trained with coach Rick Macci. Richard kept Williams and her sister from competing in the junior tournaments, hoping to ensure that they would not burn out before turning professional.In 1995, at the age of 14, Williams made her professional debut at a qualifying event in Quebec City. Fellow American Annie Miller defeated her soundly. Williams did not play another professional match until 1997, but by the end of that year she rose to number 99 in the world rankings. In 1998, Williams’s ranking rose to number 20 and she surpassed Monica Seles to become the fastest player to record five victories against Top 10 players.Williams graduated from Driftwood Academy in 1999 and soon after signed a $12 million endorsement deal with Puma. She won her first Grand Slam title that year, when she defeated Martina Hingis 6-3, 7–6 to win the U.S. Open, and rose to number four in the world rankings. Two years later, Williams lost to her sister in the U.S. Open final – it was the first time that sisters played against each other in a Grand Slam final since 1884.The African-American Williams and her sister made an immediate impact in the predominately white tennis world: their strength and athleticism on the court overmatched many opponents and their colorful, fashionable styles garnered media attention. The Williams sisters are credited with ushering in the power era of women’s tennis, characterized by blindingly-fast serves and commanding groundstrokes. They competed together as doubles partners, eventually winning 14 Grand Slam doubles titles. They took gold at the 2000, 2008, and 2012 Olympics and are the winningest doubles tennis team in Olympic history.In 2001, Williams won California’s Indian Wells tournament for the second time. Williams, along with her father and sister who were watching in the stands, claimed spectators hurled racial slurs their way while booing them. Williams later described the racist treatment as traumatizing and she boycotted the tournament until 2015.Williams continued to amass victories and rise in the rankings. In 2002, she won her second, third, and fourth Grand Slam titles at Roland-Garros (the French Open), Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open, respectively. In each of those tournaments, she defeated her sister Venus in the final match. On July 8, 2002 she reached the ranking of number one in the world, a position she held for 57 straight weeks. In 2003, Williams won her first Australian Open, becoming one of only six women in the Open Era (post-1968) to complete a career Grand Slam (in which a player wins all four major championships). Williams actually held all four titles at once, an accomplishment she dubbed “The Serena Slam.”However, 2003 also brought troubles for Williams. She underwent knee surgery in August and in September her older sister, Yetunde Price, was murdered in Los Angeles. The loss of her sister was difficult for Williams. She came back from the knee injury in the 2004 season, but other injuries plagued her for the next three years. She won the Australian Open in 2005 and 2007, but her injuries and losses resulted in her ranking dropping to number 139.In 2008, Williams began her return to championship form by winning the U.S. Open. The following year, she won the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and reclaimed her number one world ranking. Her five-year gap between number one rankings is the longest of any player ever. Williams cited her faith as a Jehovah’s Witness as well as an inspirational trip to West Africa for restoring her competitive spirit. In 2009, she faced fines and probation after an altercation with a referee at the U.S. Open, but the following year Williams added two more Grand Slam titles and finished the season ranked number four.Williams suffered from a blood clot in her lung in 2011, but returned to dominance later that year. In 2012, Williams earned a gold medal for singles’ tennis at the London Olympic Games. The 2013-2015 seasons marked her third, fourth, and fifth number-one seasons, after which she had won her 21stGrand Slam championship and completed her second Serena Slam.In 2017, Williams won the Australian Open. It was her 23rdGrand Slam title, meaning she surpassed Steffi Graf’s record for Grand Slam singles’ titles in the Open Era. A few months later, she revealed she was expecting her first child and had been pregnant when she won the Australian Open. That September, Williams gave birth to her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr., and married Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian shortly after. Williams experienced a difficult childbirth: she had an emergency cesarean section and suffered from another blood clot and other severe complications. By telling her story publicly, Williams contributed to a growing national dialogue about the disproportionately high number of Black women that suffer from pregnancy and postpartum complications.Williams returned to tennis in 2018, ranked number 549. The attention Williams brought to the issue of rankings after giving birth led the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) to take action. The WTA’s new rule allowed players who leave the sport for childbirth or injury to use their previous rankings to enter up to 12 tournaments within three years of their return. Williams, whose career winnings exceed $90 million, also advocates for female tennis players regarding equitable prize money.Outside of tennis, Williams has been busy as well. She realized her fashion design dreams when she released her clothing line (“S by Serena”) in 2018 as well as a jewelry line in 2019. She serves as a UNICEF International Goodwill Ambassador; has opened two secondary schools in Kenya; and sits on the board of the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative. She has her own venture capital firm, Serena Ventures, that invests in technology companies owned or led by women and African Americans.Williams was named the AP Female Athlete of the Decade for her dominance in the 2010s. She continues to inspire tennis hopefuls and the wider public through her hard work and pursuit of excellence on and off the court.Works CitedAllen, JA. “The Williams Sisters and the Rise of the Women's Power Game.” Bleacher Report.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)NEW YORK (AP) — When Serena Williams won the 1999 U.S. Open for her first Grand Slam title at age 17, she wore white beads in her hair. On Monday night,when Williams won her first match of the 2022 U.S. Openat age 40, her daughter, Olympia, was courtside, sporting a hairstyle paying homage to Mom’s from all that time ago.“It was either her wear beads or me, so ...”Williams saidafter beating Danka Kovinic 6-3, 6-3, finishing that thought with a smile. “I wanted to do it, but I just didn’t have the time.”Williams was pregnant with Olympia while playing in, and winning, the 2017 Australian Open for her 23rd Grand Slam title. Olympia was born later that year and turns 5 on Thursday.“Yeah, she likes, actually, wearing them. She asks to wear beads a lot,” Williams said. “It actually wasn’t my idea, but I was so happy when she had them on. It’s perfect on her.”On Monday, Olympia sat in Williams’ player guest box in Arthur Ashe Stadium, at one point snapping pictures with a camera. She was with her father — Williams’ husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian — and her grandmother — Williams’ mom, Oracene Price.ADVERTISEMENTAfter the match, Williams’ long and influential career was celebrated during an on-court ceremony that included a video narrated by Oprah Winfrey and a speech from Billie Jean King.

"I wanted to do it, but I just didn't have the time. She asks to wear beads a lot. It actually wasn't my idea, but I was so happy when she had them on. It's perfect on her."The 40-year-old arrived at the Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing, New York in a black, embellished bodice and tutu skirt by Nike, with the brand noting the sparkles were "inspired by the night sky above center court." The outfit also originally contained six layers to represent her six U.S. Open singles titles, but as Serena told Gayle King in a post-match interview, she "took four out because it was too heavy."Serena also rocked a pair of shoes from Nike and her brand Serena Williams Jewelry thatfeatured1.5-carat solid gold deubrés that spelled out "mama" and "queen," reminding spectators that there's more to the tennis star's legacy than her numerous trophies.Online fans were quick to notice Serena and Olympia's matching looks, gushing over how sweet the gesture was during what is most likely the tennis pro's final tournament.Olympia cheering on Serena is too precious 😭pic.twitter.com/z53gKZRJVz— THE SHIFT (@theshift_sports)August 29, 2022Like mother, like daughter ❤️Olympia channeled@serenawilliamsat the#USOpenpic.twitter.com/pOxGbWYB4o— ESPN (@espn)August 29, 2022Omg.

While the win means she advances to the next round, she also has her first doubles match of the tournament on Wednesday with her sister, Venus Williams -- though Serena would not confirm whether this will be the last time fans see the sisters on the court as a doubles duo.Earlier this month, Serenaannounced her intention to retirefrom the sport, and while she didn't officially use that word, she did share that she is "evolving away from tennis.""I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me," Serena shared in a first-person account published inVogue's September 2022issue. "A few years ago, I quietly started Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm. Soon after that, I started a family. I want to grow that family."Serenawelcomed her first childwith her husband in 2017. The Grand Slam winner detailed how the youngster prays for a baby sister and often says she wants to be a big sister -- something Serena and Alexis have been planning for. "In the last year, Alexis and I have been trying to have another child, and we recently got some information from my doctor that put my mind at ease and made me feel that whenever we’re ready, we can add to our family," she said. "I definitely don’t want to be pregnant again as an athlete. I need to be two feet into tennis or two feet out."And after all she's been through, it's looking like Serena is taking both feet off the court."The way I see it, I should have had 30-plus grand slams. I had my chances after coming back from giving birth. I went from a C-section to a second pulmonary embolism to a grand slam final," she candidly recalled. "I played while breastfeeding. I played through postpartum depression. But I didn’t get there. Shoulda, woulda, coulda. I didn’t show up the way I should have or could have. But I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine. Actually, it’s extraordinary. But these days, if I have to choose between building my tennis résumé and building my family, I choose the latter."For more on Serena and her legacy, check out the video below.RELATED CONTENTSerena Williams Wins First US Open Match Since Announcing Tennis ExitJohn McEnroe Praises Serena Williams Amid Her RetirementSerena Williams Talks to Selena Gomez About 'Mental Fitness'Serena Williams Gets Choked Up as She Begins Her Farewell Tour to TennSerena Williams Announces Intention to Retire From TennisSerena Williams Says Working on ‘King Richard’ With Her Family Was a ‘Great Experience’ (Exclusive)This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.If you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.Up NextRelated GallerySerena Williams and Daughter Olympia's Adorable Matching MomentsSerena WilliamsAlexis OhanianSportsShareShare on FacebookTweetShare on TwitterLatestNews'The Voice' Season 23 Team Rosters: Watch All the Battle Rounds!'One Tree Hill' Star Shantel VanSanten's Husband Files for DivorceGet theLatestNewsEmailBy signing up, you agree to ourTerms of UseandPrivacy PolicyBrowse ETOnlineNewsVideoPhotosMoviesTVAwardsMusicStyleGiveawaysNewslettersConnect with ETFacebookInstagramTwitterYouTubeET on TVAboutETonline StaffRSSSubmit FeedbackSites We LoveParamount+CBS NewsInside EditionRachael Ray ShowDABLDr. PhilStar TrekThe Drew Barrymore Showlast.fmMixibleGet theLatestNewsEmailBy signing up, you agree to ourTerms of UseandPrivacy PolicyFacebookInstagramTwitterYouTubeRSS™ & © 2023 CBS Studios Inc. and CBS Interactive Inc., Paramount companies.  All Rights Reserved.Terms of UsePrivacy PolicyClosed CaptioningSubmit a TipDo Not Sell My Personal Information

Shortly after her birth, Serena Williams tweeted, “Fun fact my daughter’s initials are AO as in the Aussie open she won with me.”Serena Williams found out she was pregnant with her daughter just two days before the Australian Open in 2017. According toToday, she understandably felt nervous once she discovered her pregnancy because, “You hear all these stories about people when they’re pregnant — they get sick, they get really tired, really stressed out … I had to really take all that energy and put it in a paper bag, so to say, and throw it away.”Serena Williams hasn’t won a major since giving birth to her daughter, but many speculate that she could still have an exciting tennis career moving forward. Some also wonder if Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. will be a tennis star like her mother, a successful tech entrepreneur like her father, or something else entirely. It will certainly be fun to see which path she takes.Tags:Serena WilliamsInstagramYoutubeFacebookTwitterAbout UsContact UsCareersEthicsFact checking commitmentCorrections commitmentOwnership funding advertising infoSportscastingEndgame360MotorBiscuit© Copyright 2023 Endgame360 Inc.

Williams(born September 26, 1981)[1]is an American inactive professionaltennisplayer. Considered among the greatest tennis players of all time,[a]she was rankedworld No. 1in singles by theWomen's Tennis Association(WTA) for 319 weeks, including a joint-record 186 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. She won 23Grand Slamsingles titles, the most by any player in theOpen Era, and thesecond-most of all time. She is the only player, male or female, to accomplish aCareer Golden Slamin both singles and doubles.[19]Along with her older sisterVenus, Serena Williams was coached by her parentsOracene PriceandRichard Williams. Turning professional in 1995, she won her first major singles title at the1999 US Open. From the2002 French Opento the2003 Australian Open, she was dominant, winning all four major singles titles (each time over Venus in the final) to achieve anon-calendar year Grand Slamand thecareer Grand Slam, known as the 'Serena Slam'. The next few years saw her claim two more singles majors, but suffer from injury and decline in form. Beginning in 2007, however, she gradually returned to form despite continued injuries, retaking the world No. 1 singles ranking. Beginning at the2012 Wimbledon Championships, Williams returned to dominance, claimingOlympic gold(completing the Career Golden Slam in singles)[20]and winning eight out of thirteen singles majors, including all four in a row from 2014–15 to achieve a second "Serena Slam". At the2017 Australian Open, she won her 23rd major singles title, surpassingSteffi Graf's Open Era record. She then took a break from professional tennis after becoming pregnant and reached four major finals upon returning to play. In August 2022, Williams announced her impending "evolution" away from professional tennis and played what was expected to be her final match at the2022 US Open.[21]Williams also won 14 major women's doubles titles, all with her sister Venus, and the pair was unbeaten in major doubles finals (the best unbeaten record in major finals in any discipline of the sport).[22][23]The pair achieved a non-calendar year Grand Slam between the2009 Wimbledon Championshipsand the2010 French Open, which granted the sisters thedoubles world No. 1 ranking. Serena won fourOlympic gold medals, three in women's doubles—an all-time joint record in tennis, shared with her sister.[24][25]The duo are the only women in the Open Era to win Olympic gold in both singles and doubles.[26]She also won two major mixed doubles titles, both in 1998. She is the only singles player, male or female, to complete three Career Golden Slams – one in women's singles and two in same-sex doubles.[19]The arrival of theWilliams sistershas been credited with ushering in a new era of power and athleticism on the women's professional tennis tour.[27][28][29][30]Serena holds a combined 39 major titles: 23 in singles, 14 in women's doubles, and two in mixed doubles. She isjoint-third on the all-time listand second in the Open Era for total major titles. She is the most recent woman to simultaneously hold all four major singles titles (2002–03 and 2014–15), and the most recent woman to win theSurface Slam(major titles onhard,clayandgrasscourts in the same calendar year), doing so in 2015. She is also, with Venus, the most recent player to have simultaneously held all four major women's doubles titles (2009–10).Williams was the world's highest paid woman athlete in 2016, earning almost $29 million.[31]She repeated this feat in 2017 when she was the only woman onForbes'list of the 100 highest-paid athletes, with $27million in prize money and endorsements. She won theLaureus Sportswoman of the Yearaward a record four times (2003, 2010, 2016, 2018), and in December 2015 was namedSportsperson of the YearbySports Illustratedmagazine.[32]She is the highest-earning woman athlete of all time.[33]Early lifeWilliams was born on September 26, 1981, inSaginaw, MichigantoOracene PriceandRichard Williams. She is the youngest of Price's five daughters: half-sistersYetunde, Lyndrea, and Isha Price, and full older sisterVenus.[1]She also has at least seven paternal half-siblings.[34][35]When the children were young, the family moved toCompton, California, where she started playing tennis at age four.[36][37]Her father home-schooled her and her sister, Venus.[38][39]While he and subsequently her mother have been their official coaches, her other mentors have included Richard Williams, a Compton man who shared her father's name and subsequently founded The Venus and Serena Williams Tennis Tutorial Academy.[40]Williams sisters at aPam Shriverevent in Baltimore, 1993When Williams was nine, she and her family moved from Compton toWest Palm Beach, Florida[36]so she could attend the tennis academy ofRick Macci, who provided her with additional coaching. Macci did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls".[41]Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, as he wanted them to "go slowly" and focus on school work. Experiences of racism also influenced this decision, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments.[42]At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on theUnited States Tennis Associationjunior tour and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida.[43]In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether it would have been more beneficial for them to have followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit, Williams responded, "Everyone does different things. I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us."[43]Professional career1995–1998: Professional debutWilliams' parents wanted their daughter to wait until she was 16 to participate in professional tournaments.[44]In 1995, just after turning 14, Williams planned to make her professional debut as awild-cardentry in theBank of the West ClassicinOakland, California, but was denied by the WTA owing to their age-eligibility restrictions.[45]She subsequently filed an antitrust lawsuit against the women's tour, but withdrew it at her parents' request.[45]Her first professional event was in October 1995 at theBell ChallengeinQuebec,[44][46]where she used a wild-card entry to circumvent age-eligibility rules.[44]She lost in the first qualifying round to then 18-year-old AmericanAnnie Miller, winning just two games.[47]Williams did not play a tournament in 1996. The next year, she lost in the qualifying rounds of three tournaments,[48]before winning her first main-draw match in November at theAmeritech Cup Chicago.[49]Ranked No. 304, she upset No. 7Mary Pierce, and No. 4Monica Seles,[50][51]recording her first career wins over top10 players and becoming the lowest-ranked player in the Open Era to defeat two top-10 opponents in one tournament.[1]She ultimately lost in the semifinals to No. 5Lindsay Davenport.[52]She finished 1997 ranked No. 99.[53]Williams began 1998 at theMedibank International Sydney.[54]As a qualifier ranked No. 96,[55]she defeated No. 3 Davenport in the quarterfinals,[55]before losing toArantxa Sánchez Vicarioin the semifinals.[56]Williams made her debut in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament at theAustralian Open,[57]where she defeated sixth-seededIrina Spîrleain the first round,[58]before losing to her sister, Venus, in the second round in the sisters' first professional match.[58][54]She reached six other quarterfinals during the year, but lost all of them,[59]including her first match against No. 1-rankedMartina Hingisat theLipton International Players Championshipsin Key Biscayne,[60]and her second match against Venus at theItalian Openin Rome.[59]She failed to reach the quarterfinals of any Grand Slam tournament the remainder of the year,[citation needed]losing in the fourth round of the French Open to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario,[61]and the third round of theUS Opento Spîrlea.[62]She withdrew fromWimbledontwo games into a match withVirginia Ruano Pascual, after straining a calf muscle during the first set.[63]She did win the mixed doubles titles atWimbledonand theUS OpenwithMax Mirnyi, completing the Williams family's sweep of the 1998 mixed doubles Grand Slam tournaments. She won her first professional title in doubles at theU.S. National Indoor Championshipsin Oklahoma City with Venus, becoming the third pair of sisters to win a WTA title.[1]They won two more doubles titles that year. Williams finished the year ranked No. 20 in singles.[citation needed]Battle of the sexes: Karsten Braasch vs. the Williams sistersMain article:Battle of the Sexes (tennis)A 16-year-old Serena and her sister Venus competed in a tennis "Battle of the Sexes" againstKarsten Braaschat the 1998 Australian Open.[64]At the time Braasch was 203rd in the ATP rankings. The sisters had claimed they could beat any man outside the top 200, and accepted his challenge. Braasch beat both of them, playing one set against each. The score versus Serena was 6–1 and 6–2 against Venus.[65]Braasch said afterward, "500 and above, no chance." The sisters later tweaked the number to beating men outside the top 350.[66]1999–2001: Becoming a top-10 playerWilliams lost in the third round of the1999 Australian OpentoSandrine Testud. A month later, Williams won her first professional singles title when she defeatedAmélie Mauresmoin the final of theOpen Gaz de Francein Paris.

With a world ranking at the time of 181,[257]many felt that the decision showed bias and favored Williams unduly.[258]Others argued that theAll England Club, who do not base their seedings on players' current world rankings – as other grand slam tournaments do– had sensibly considered Williams's excellent historic record there.

I came in here expecting that maybe I wouldn't get a seed."[258]Her seeding resulted inDominika Cibulkoválosing her place to be seeded.[citation needed]By the second week of the tournament, for the first time in grand slam history, none of the top ten seeded women players had made it to the quarterfinals.[259]En route to the quarterfinals, Williams had beatenArantxa Rusof Holland in round one,Viktoriya Tomovaof Bulgaria in round 2,Kristina Mladenovicof France in round 3 andEvgeniya Rodinaof Russia in round 4.[260]She had not lost a set in any of her matches till then.

She beatNuria Párrizas Díazin straight sets for her first singles win in 14 months, before losing toBelinda Bencic.[294][295]Williams subsequently entered the2022 Cincinnati Masters, in which she lost to reigning US Open championEmma Raducanuin the first round.[296]Before the US Open, Williams announced she would play doubles with Venus for the first time since 2018. Theiropening-round matchmarked the first time a first-round doubles match was held in theArthur Ashe Stadiumduring television primetime. The sisters lost to the Czech duo ofLucie HradeckáandLinda Nosková.[297]Insingles, Williams won her opening-round match againstDanka Kovinić. In the second round, she upset world No. 2Anett Kontaveitto become the oldest woman ever to defeat a top-three ranked player.[citation needed]She then played what was expected to be her final match againstAjla Tomljanović, losing in three hard-fought sets.Transition from tennisIn the September 2022 issue ofVogue, written in August, Williams announced that she was "evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me". In her announcement she said that she disliked the word "retirement" and preferred the term "evolution".[298]She went on to cite growing her family, focusing on her venture capital firm, and spending more time with family as reasons she would be leaving the sport. While she did not set an exact time for her goodbye, she stated that she was not ready to winWimbledon(where shelost in the first round), but would try to win inNew York. She also said that she consultedTiger Woodsin her decision.[298]At her first match since the publication of theVoguearticle, where she lost toBelinda BencicinToronto, tournament organizers interviewed Williams on-court after her match and gave her gifts to remember the city.[299]At her matches at the2022 US Open, which many believed would be her last tournament, tournament directors played a video following her opponents' introduction but before Williams' walk-out. Some saw this as disrespectful to her opponents.[300]Following her first-round match, where Woods,Mike Tyson,Bill Clinton,Ruth Westheimer,Spike Lee,Vera Wang, andEric Adamswere in attendance, the tournament played a video narrated byOprah Winfreyand hadGayle Kingfacilitate the post-match on-court interview.[301][302][303]Following her announcement, many fellow players, includingNaomi OsakaandCoco Gauff, praised Williams and said they would not be playing tennis if not for her.[304]Playing styleWilliams is anaggressive baseliner, whose game is centered around her powerful serve and forceful groundstrokes. Owing to her high-risk playing style, she typically hits a large number of both winners and unforced errors. Williams' greatest asset is her serve, which is considered the greatest in the history of women's tennis. Her serve is known for its fast pace and accurate placement, allowing her to serve numerous aces: at the2013 Australian Open, she served a 128.6 mph (207 km/h) ace in her third round match againstAyumi Morita, which is the third fastest serve recorded in WTA history.[305]Williams possesses an accurate and consistent ball toss, allowing her to serve to any position on the court with minimal differences in the position of the ball in the air; this makes it difficult for opponents to read her service motion and predict the position of her serve, allowing her to dominate a rally from the first stroke.[306]Williams also possesses effective and accurate kick and slice serves, which she deploys as second serves, minimizing double faults, and preventing opponents from scoring free points.[307]Williams is also known for her forceful groundstrokes, which are considered two of the most powerful shots in the history of women's tennis.[308]She hits both her forehand and her backhand in an open stance, allowing her to generate consistently powerful, heavy, and dominating groundstrokes, and to generate sharp, acute angles, which allow her to hit winners from any position on the court.[309]Williams is known for her forehand, which has been described as "devastating".[310]Her forehand is hit with heavy topspin; this allows her to dominate rallies, and she is capable of hitting her forehand both crosscourt and down the line to produce winners.[311]Her two-handed backhand is equally dominant, and has been described as one of the greatest backhands of all time.[312]Williams tends to hit her backhand flatter than her forehand, allowing her to hit her backhand with speed, power, and depth both crosscourt and down the line. Despite playing primarily from the baseline, Williams is an adept net player thanks to her extensive doubles experience, and will frequently choose to finish points at the net, either with deft touch, aggressive drive volleys, or a solid, powerful, and reliable overhead smash.[313]Williams possesses an aggressive return of serve – she neutralizes powerful first serves, and attacks weak second serves. She is widely considered one of the greatest return players of all time.[314]Despite predominantly employing an aggressive game style, she is also an excellent defender, and is capable of counterpunching against aggressive opponents until she creates an opportunity to hit a winner. She is an exceptional athlete, known for her movement, speed, court coverage, agility, flexibility, balance, and footwork. Her on-court intelligence, shot selection, and point construction allow her to execute her gamestyle effectively.[315]She has been praised for her mental strength and competitive spirit, with her being described as one of the toughest opponents to beat on the court;Martina Navratilovadeclared her mental strength "unbelievable",[316]whilst tennis journalistJon Wertheimclaimed that Williams is the toughest player of all time.[317]American tennis playerChristina McHalepraised her composure in high pressure moments, stating that, for Williams, "being clutch is like breathing", and that she "seems to come through every single time in the most pressure-packed situations".[318]She has been noted for her ability to produce extraordinary comebacks, particularly on the Grand Slam level, winning three Slams after saving match points, a feat achieved more often than by any other player in tennis history.[319]Williams bounced back from a set down to win 37 Grand Slam matches; her ability to come back from set and break deficits in Grand Slam matches was described byJohn McEnroeas "a gift", and McEnroe declared that she was "the greatest" competitor in the history of women's tennis.[320]She has also been praised for her ability to serve aces at critical moments. As noted by retired playerLi Nain 2016, "break point down, [there is an] 80% chance [she] serves an ace".[321]Owing to her exceptional serve, powerful groundstrokes, technical mastery, aggressive return of serve, athleticism, and mental strength, Williams has been described as one of the most complete players on tour, and one of the greatest players of all time, irrespective of gender.[322]Williams has stated that her favourite surface is clay, as the slow pace and high bounce afforded aids point construction, although she also excels on faster hard and grass courts.[323]RivalriesSerena vs. VenusMain article:Williams sisters rivalryWilliams played older sisterVenusin 31 professional matches since 1998.[54]Overall, Serena is 19–12 against her sister.[54]Serena played Venus 15 times in Grand Slam singles and 13 times in other tournaments (including 11 finals).[324]They have met in nine Grand Slam tournament finals, with Serena winning seven times.[54]Beginning with the2002 French Open, they played each other in four consecutive Grand Slam finals, which was the first time in the Open Era that the same two players had contested four consecutive finals in Grand Slam singles.[325]Williams vs. HingisMain article:Hingis–S. Williams rivalryWilliams leads the series 7–6.[326]One of Williams's first rivalries was with Martina Hingis, who turned pro less than one year before her (Hingis in October 1994, Williams in 1995). They first played each other at the 1998 Miami Open where Hingis won in three sets. All but one of their matches was played on a hard court with the exception being a contest on clay in Rome 1999, which Hingis won in straight sets. Their last match took place at the 2002 Miami Open with Williams winning in a loss of just four games.[327]Hingis was forced to briefly retire citing ankle injuries.[328]Williams vs. CapriatiWilliams leads the series againstJennifer Capriati10–7.[329]Once considered one of the best rivalries in women's tennis,[330]the competition between Williams and Capriati was stiff with 12 out of 17 meetings going three sets. The rivalry, starting in 1999, began one sided with Capriati winning four of their first five matches. Williams would then go on to win the next eight.[329]Williams and Capriati played with similar styles, both known for using their power and athleticism to gain quick advantages in points.[331][332]Williams vs. HeninMain article:Henin–S. Williams rivalryWilliams leads the series 8–6.Justine Heninand Williams met 14 times, five of which were in tournament finals. In majors they have faced each other seven times with Henin leading 4–3.[333]Opposite personalities and styles of play are often cited as what made their rivalry entertaining.[334][335]In the semifinals of the2003 French Open, when at 4–2, 30–0 on Williams's serve in the third set, Henin raised her hand to indicate she was not ready to receive; Williams then put her serve into the net. The umpire did not see Henin raise her hand, and thus did not allow Williams a first serve. Williams lost the game and would go on to lose the match. Their last match took place in the final of the2010 Australian Openwhere Williams won in three sets to take her 12th major title.[333]Williams vs. AzarenkaWilliams leads the series 18–5. The rivalry began at the 2008 Australian Open, and their most recent match was in the semifinals of the 2020 US Open. Williams holds a 10–1 record in Grand Slams. Azarenka is the only person to ever win four WTA tour level finals against Williams.[336]While their rivalry is heavily favored towards Williams, their matches are known for their fierce competitiveness, and Azarenka is considered the only player to truly challenge Williams following the retirement of Capriati, Henin, and Hingis, with 9 of their matches extending to three sets.[337]Williams vs. SharapovaWilliams leads the series 20–2. The pair first met in the fourth round of the2004 Miami Open, where Williams defeated Sharapova 6–4, 6–3. Their rivalry truly began at the2004 Wimbledon final, where Williams was the two-time defending champion; Sharapova upset her 6–1, 6–4. Williams next lost to Sharapova in the finals of the2004 WTA Tour Championships, 6–4, 2–6, 4–6. Since then, however, Williams dominated the rivalry, winning all of their clashes, with only three of their matches going to three sets. They met 10 times in Grand Slam tournaments, where Williams led 9–1, and they further met in 9 finals, with Williams leading 7–2. Sharapova retired in February 2020, with their final match being in the first round of the2019 US Open; Williams defeated Sharapova 6–1, 6–1 in one hour exactly. Despite the one-sided nature of their rivalry, it is considered one of the most prominent rivalries on the WTA Tour of the 21st century, due to alleged personality clashes, similarly aggressive playing styles, and significant media interest.[338]Match controversiesAccusations of match fixingWhen both of the Williams sisters entered the top ten and started meeting in tournaments, rumors ofmatch fixingstarted to circulate.John McEnroe, while commenting on the 2000 Wimbledon semifinal between the two sisters, said that "Serena may not be allowed to win. Richard [Williams] may have something to say about this."[339]After losing to Venus at the Indian Wells quarterfinals in 2001,Elena Dementievaasserted during a post-match interview that Richard Williams decided the results of matches between the two sisters.[340]Shortly after that, Venus Williams pulled out of her Indian Wells semifinal match against Serena Williams at the last minute, claimingtendinitis; this occurrence garnered much speculation in the press, and some fans demanded their money back.[341][342][343]Indian Wells boycottAt the 2001 Ericsson Open the following week, Richard Williams stated that racist comments were made to him in the stands,[344]and the tournament director refused to offer Williams an apology for how he was treated.[citation needed]As a result, neither sister played the tournament even though it had become a mandatory stop on the WTA tour since 2009. In 2015, Williams decided to end her 14-year boycott and played.[345]2004 US OpenIn herUS Openquarterfinal match againstJennifer Capriati, an incorrect overrule was made by chair umpireMariana Alves; the video review showed that Williams's shot landed in bounds. In the same match, new technology being tested made incorrect line calls late in the third set. Williams argued with the chair over a couple of calls during the match, but was not successful. Capriati won the match, with Serena herself acknowledging that this was primarily due to her 57 unforced errors; nevertheless, she accused Alves of temporary insanity[346]and said that she "felt cheated".[347]In a post-match interview Capriati sharply observed that bad calls had gone against her in the past as well. Alves did not officiate for the remainder of the tournament; this was not punitive, as commonly thought, as she was not scheduled to officiate.[348]The controversy renewed calls for, and was widely given credit for, the adoption of technology such as theMacCAMandHawk-Eyesystems.[349]2009 US OpenIn theUS Opensemifinal round againstKim Clijsters, Williams slammed her racket on the court after losing the first set. She was given a warning, with a potential second violation carrying a one-point penalty. While trailing 4–6, 5–6, 15–30, Williams's second serve was called afoot fault, resulting in two match points for Clijsters. Williams gestured with her racket to the lineswoman who had made the call and yelled at her, with profanities and a threat to shove a tennis ball down the lineswoman's throat.[350]During the subsequent on-court conference between the chair umpire, the lineswoman, US Open officials, and Williams, a television microphone picked up Williams saying to the lineswoman, "I didn't say I would kill you! Are you serious?"[351]The incident resulted in Williams being penalized a point for unsportsmanlike conduct‍—‌necessitated by the earlier warning for racket abuse‍—‌meaning Clijsters won the match 6–4, 7–5. The following day, Williams was issued the maximum permissible on-site fine of $10,000 (plus $500 for racket abuse). After further investigation, the Grand Slam Committee in November 2009 fined her $175,000 in place of suspending her from the 2010 US Open or other Grand Slam events.[352]They also placed her on a two-year probation which provided that if Williams committed another offense at a Grand Slam event in the next two years, she would be suspended from participating in the following US Open. If, however, she committed no offenses within the next two years, her fine would be reduced to $82,500.[352]Williams initially refused to apologize for her outburst, both in her post-match press conference[353]and in an official statement released the following day.[124]She eventually did apologize, stating "I just really wanted to apologize sincerely because I'm a very prideful person, and I'm a very intense person and a very emotional person", and "I wanted to offer my sincere apologies to anyone that I may have offended." She said she was humbled by the experience.[354]2011 US OpenIn the final of the2011 US OpenagainstSamantha Stosur, Williams shouted "Come on!" as the Australian attempted to return aforehandWilliams believed to be a winner. The chair umpireEva Asderakiawarded the point to Stosur based on theITF's deliberate hindrance rule, which states, "If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if involuntary, the point shall be replayed."[355]As the point was 30–40 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur. Williams became angry with the chair umpire and made several gestures and unflattering comments toward her during the next changeover, including telling Asderaki that if the umpire ever saw Serena coming toward her, she should "look the other way".[356]Williams initially gained momentum in the set following the penalty, breaking back in the next game, but eventually flagged and lost the match, 2–6, 3–6. At the end of the match, she declined to offer the customary handshake to Asderaki.[357][358]Williams mentioned the incident in her post-match speech as the tournament runner-up, asserting, "I hit a winner, but I guess it didn't count", but added, "It wouldn't have mattered in the end. Sam played well."[359]A writer forESPNsuggested that Williams could avoid being found to have violated the terms of the "probation" on which she was placed following her 2009 outburst, as she did not appear to have usedprofanityin addressing Asderaki during the match.[360]In the end, Williams was fined $2,000 and was not barred from competing in the2012 US Openbecause "Williams' conduct, while verbally abusive, does not rise to the level of a major offense under the Grand Slam Code of Conduct."[361]2018 US OpenWilliams's2018 US Openended in controversy with Williams falling toNaomi Osakain straight sets following a game penalty in the second set of thefinal. During that second set, she was given a code violation because her coach,Patrick Mouratoglou, gave her coaching hand signals. Williams was upset by the violation, claiming that her coach was simply giving her a thumbs up, and demanded an apology from chair umpireCarlos Ramos. Mouratoglou later admitted that he was coaching.[362]She received a second violation for smashing her racket on the court, which resulted in a point penalty. After her third code violation for verbal abuse against the umpire, Williams was assessed a game penalty.[363][364]Williams said that she believed she was treated unfairly by the umpire because she is a woman.[365]Williams was fined a total of $17,000 including $4,000 for a coaching violation, $3,000 for racket abuse and $10,000 for verbal abuse towards the umpire.[366]Other issuesIn the beginning years of Williams' professional career, hair beads donned by the Williams sisters were the focus of discussion by commentators such as Chris Evert and John McEnroe, with Mary Carillo characterizing their hair as "noisy and disruptive".[367]The beads often broke and scattered across the court. Scholar Nancy E. Spencer said that commentary that dismissed the Williams' cultural hairstyles served to"other"the sisters, particularly in the context of a white dominated sport where their appearance and specifically their physicality is a popular topic for discussion.[367]Following the match controversy at the 2018 US Open final between Williams and Naomi Osaka, the Melbourne newspaper theHerald Sunpublished a cartoon byMark Knightdepicting Williams having a tantrum and breaking her racket while the umpire asks her opponent to "just let her win".[368]The cartoon was widely criticized as racist and sexist, including by Williams's husband, Reddit co-founderAlexis Ohanian, and authorJ. K. Rowling.[369][370]Complaints centered around the portrayal of Williams as an angry black woman with exaggerated large lips, a broad flat nose, and positioned in an ape-like pose, and the portrayal of Williams's opponent, Osaka, who is half-Japanese, half-Haitian, with blonde hair.[371]The editor of the Herald Sun argued the cartoon was unfairly criticized on social media.[372]Knight defended his work, saying that his satire was never about race or gender, but was about putting a spotlight on bad behavior by sporting superstars. In the immediate aftermath of the controversy he suspended his Twitter account to "protect his family and friends".[372]In September 2019, Romanian television host Radu Banciu made the following comments during a live broadcast: "Serena Williams looks exactly like one of those monkeys at the zoo with the red asses."[373]Romania'sNational Council for Combating Discriminationfined Banciu approximately $1,875 for his comments.LegacyWilliams is considered one of the best female tennis players of all time. In 2017,BBC Sportusers picked Williams as the greatest female tennis player of the Open Era. BBC presenter and former French Open Champion,Sue Barker, said "Serena is the greatest because this era is so much more competitive than previous eras. The pace she generates – her serve is without question the greatest ever – combined with her movement and her power, she pushes her opponents constantly on the back foot".[374]In 2018, a Tennis.com panel selected Serena as thegreatest female tennis player in the Open Era.[375]Some commentators, players and sports writers regard Williams as the greatest woman tennis player of all time.[b]In 2018,Federersaid the player who probably had the best case for tennis "Greatest Of All Time", man or woman, was Serena Williams.[377]In 2020, the Tennis Channel ranked Williams as the greatest woman tennis player of all time.[378]In 2022,John McEnroedescribed Williams as an "icon" and the "GOAT of GOATs".[379][380]Alongside her sisterVenus, Williams has been widely credited with increasing diversity within the sport:[381][382][383]It all starts with Venus and Serena. The demonstration effect. The power of seeing two African-American girls with braids in the finals of the biggest tournaments in the world in a predominantly white sport. Just a huge impact that really can't be overstated. That attracted thousands of girls into the sport, not just African-American but all backgrounds and races.

What Does Olympia Mean? Serena Williams’ Baby Is Named After Her Father, But Her Middle Name Stands OutMENUEntertainmentSerena Williams’ Baby’s Middle Name Stands Out For A Couple Major ReasonsbyMarenah DobinSep. 13, 2017Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty ImagesTennis great Serena Williams and and her fiancé, Alexis Ohanian, are new parents to a baby girl. In an Instagram story posted on Wednesday morning, Williams shared that their daughter's name is Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. Obviously, her first name comes from her father, butwhat does the middle name Olympia mean?Of course, the name Olympia brings images of the Olympics to mind and considering this baby's mom is an Olympic gold medalist, this seems like a good fit. According to NameBerry.com, the nameOlympia has a Greek origin(obviously) and means "Of Mount Olympus," which is home of the Greek gods and goddesses. Olympia, Greece was alsowhere the ancient Olympic Games took place. Name Berry also points out that "this name has an athletic, goddess-like aura," which sounds like the perfect description for Alexis' mommy. It's also the perfect choice if she wants to pursue a career in athletics. The headlines would basically write themselves if she competed in the Olympics in the future, let alone if she ended up winning a medal.At this point it's unclear if the baby will go by Alexis or if she will addressed by her middle name to avoid the confusion of her father having the same first name. If she does go by Olympia, she would definitely stand out among her peers. According to the site BabyNameScience.com,Olympia is a unique namesince only 1 in 239,585 baby girls are given this name. In fact, the peak popularity of the name Olympia was in 1917 when it was at number 790 on the list of the most popular names. It will be interesting to see how much higher the name Olympia ranks in popularity if Williams and Ohanian end up referring to the baby by her middle name.Aside from the obvious athletic association with the name Olympia, the word Olympia can refer to a number of other things that make it the perfect name for success in many different pursuits.Olympia is a renowned music hall in Paris, where artists including The Beatles, Madonna, Celine Dion, and the Rolling Stones have performed. It is also the name of other performance venues inLiverpool, United KingdomandDublin, Ireland.In 1863, artistÉdouard Manet created a famous oil paintingnamed "Olympia," which depicts a servant bringing flowers to a naked woman laying down. The painting caused quite the stir back in the day since the "subject of the painting represented a prostitute," according to Manet.org.If people do end up referring to Alexis as Olympia, she will be one of the most well-known people around today with that moniker considering who her parents are. Even so, there have been plenty of famous Olympias throughout the years, including the mother of Alexander the Great. There's also actorOlympia Dukakis, who is best known for playing Cher's motherin the movieMoonstruck. She won an Academy Award and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for the role. Then there'sOlympia Snowe, a United States senatorfrom Maine from 1995 to 2013.As if being the first daughter of one of the best tennis players of all time and a brilliant business mind isn't enough, Alexis' middle name has the perfect combination of being full of history, but not being overdone. If the baby ends up going by her middle name, she will be able to make a major mark for Olympias of the future.More like thisWatch Blake Lively Stun Wrexham Fan With A “Savage” ResponseBySam RamsdenBrooke Shields "Made & Lost Everything Twice" Earlier In Her CareerByGrace WehniainenLisa Ann Walter Shared The "Weird" 'Parent Trap' Coincidence In Her LifeByStephanie Topacio LongKate Winslet Didn't Like Her 'Titanic' Performance For This Surprising ReasonByMarina WattsGet Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The NewsletterFrom hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.Bustle DailyUp NextSubmitBy subscribing to this BDG newsletter, you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy PolicySubscribe to our newsletter >SEARCHCLOSEEntertainmentSee AllTV & MoviesBooksCelebrityMusicStreamingStyleSee AllFashionBeautyCelebrity StyleWellnessSee AllHealthRelationshipsSelfLifeSee AllAstrologyTechFoodTravelRule BreakersOriginalsAmplifying Our VoicesShopVideoChoose an edition:US/UKNewsletterAboutArchiveDMCAAdvertiseTermsPrivacyMastheadEditorial StandardsYour Privacy Options© 2023 BDG Media, Inc.

With 23 Grand Slam titles, Williams rose from the public courts of Compton, California to shatter records and dominate the field.Serena Jameka Williams was born to parents Richard Williams and Oracene Price on September 26, 1981 in Saginaw, Michigan. Williams is the youngest of Price's five daughters, who include fellow tennis superstar Venus Williams. Richard Williams, a former sharecropper from Louisiana, was determined that daughters Serena and Venus would succeed in life. Seeing opportunity in tennis, he and Oracene taught themselves the game from books and videos so that they could coach their children. Richard moved the family to Compton, California, where Williams began intensive tennis training with her father and older sister around the age of three. The Williams sisters practiced for hours every day on rundown public tennis courts.Williams joined the junior United States Tennis Association tour and by 1991 she ranked first in the 10-and-under division. Richard then moved the family to Palm Beach, Florida, where the sisters trained with coach Rick Macci. Richard kept Williams and her sister from competing in the junior tournaments, hoping to ensure that they would not burn out before turning professional.In 1995, at the age of 14, Williams made her professional debut at a qualifying event in Quebec City. Fellow American Annie Miller defeated her soundly. Williams did not play another professional match until 1997, but by the end of that year she rose to number 99 in the world rankings. In 1998, Williams’s ranking rose to number 20 and she surpassed Monica Seles to become the fastest player to record five victories against Top 10 players.Williams graduated from Driftwood Academy in 1999 and soon after signed a $12 million endorsement deal with Puma. She won her first Grand Slam title that year, when she defeated Martina Hingis 6-3, 7–6 to win the U.S. Open, and rose to number four in the world rankings. Two years later, Williams lost to her sister in the U.S. Open final – it was the first time that sisters played against each other in a Grand Slam final since 1884.The African-American Williams and her sister made an immediate impact in the predominately white tennis world: their strength and athleticism on the court overmatched many opponents and their colorful, fashionable styles garnered media attention. The Williams sisters are credited with ushering in the power era of women’s tennis, characterized by blindingly-fast serves and commanding groundstrokes. They competed together as doubles partners, eventually winning 14 Grand Slam doubles titles. They took gold at the 2000, 2008, and 2012 Olympics and are the winningest doubles tennis team in Olympic history.In 2001, Williams won California’s Indian Wells tournament for the second time. Williams, along with her father and sister who were watching in the stands, claimed spectators hurled racial slurs their way while booing them. Williams later described the racist treatment as traumatizing and she boycotted the tournament until 2015.Williams continued to amass victories and rise in the rankings. In 2002, she won her second, third, and fourth Grand Slam titles at Roland-Garros (the French Open), Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open, respectively. In each of those tournaments, she defeated her sister Venus in the final match. On July 8, 2002 she reached the ranking of number one in the world, a position she held for 57 straight weeks. In 2003, Williams won her first Australian Open, becoming one of only six women in the Open Era (post-1968) to complete a career Grand Slam (in which a player wins all four major championships). Williams actually held all four titles at once, an accomplishment she dubbed “The Serena Slam.”However, 2003 also brought troubles for Williams. She underwent knee surgery in August and in September her older sister, Yetunde Price, was murdered in Los Angeles. The loss of her sister was difficult for Williams. She came back from the knee injury in the 2004 season, but other injuries plagued her for the next three years. She won the Australian Open in 2005 and 2007, but her injuries and losses resulted in her ranking dropping to number 139.In 2008, Williams began her return to championship form by winning the U.S. Open. The following year, she won the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and reclaimed her number one world ranking. Her five-year gap between number one rankings is the longest of any player ever. Williams cited her faith as a Jehovah’s Witness as well as an inspirational trip to West Africa for restoring her competitive spirit. In 2009, she faced fines and probation after an altercation with a referee at the U.S. Open, but the following year Williams added two more Grand Slam titles and finished the season ranked number four.Williams suffered from a blood clot in her lung in 2011, but returned to dominance later that year. In 2012, Williams earned a gold medal for singles’ tennis at the London Olympic Games. The 2013-2015 seasons marked her third, fourth, and fifth number-one seasons, after which she had won her 21stGrand Slam championship and completed her second Serena Slam.In 2017, Williams won the Australian Open. It was her 23rdGrand Slam title, meaning she surpassed Steffi Graf’s record for Grand Slam singles’ titles in the Open Era. A few months later, she revealed she was expecting her first child and had been pregnant when she won the Australian Open. That September, Williams gave birth to her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr., and married Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian shortly after. Williams experienced a difficult childbirth: she had an emergency cesarean section and suffered from another blood clot and other severe complications. By telling her story publicly, Williams contributed to a growing national dialogue about the disproportionately high number of Black women that suffer from pregnancy and postpartum complications.Williams returned to tennis in 2018, ranked number 549. The attention Williams brought to the issue of rankings after giving birth led the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) to take action. The WTA’s new rule allowed players who leave the sport for childbirth or injury to use their previous rankings to enter up to 12 tournaments within three years of their return. Williams, whose career winnings exceed $90 million, also advocates for female tennis players regarding equitable prize money.Outside of tennis, Williams has been busy as well. She realized her fashion design dreams when she released her clothing line (“S by Serena”) in 2018 as well as a jewelry line in 2019. She serves as a UNICEF International Goodwill Ambassador; has opened two secondary schools in Kenya; and sits on the board of the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative. She has her own venture capital firm, Serena Ventures, that invests in technology companies owned or led by women and African Americans.Williams was named the AP Female Athlete of the Decade for her dominance in the 2010s. She continues to inspire tennis hopefuls and the wider public through her hard work and pursuit of excellence on and off the court.Works CitedAllen, JA. “The Williams Sisters and the Rise of the Women's Power Game.” Bleacher Report.

Williams(born September 26, 1981)[1]is an American inactive professionaltennisplayer. Considered among the greatest tennis players of all time,[a]she was rankedworld No. 1in singles by theWomen's Tennis Association(WTA) for 319 weeks, including a joint-record 186 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. She won 23Grand Slamsingles titles, the most by any player in theOpen Era, and thesecond-most of all time. She is the only player, male or female, to accomplish aCareer Golden Slamin both singles and doubles.[19]Along with her older sisterVenus, Serena Williams was coached by her parentsOracene PriceandRichard Williams. Turning professional in 1995, she won her first major singles title at the1999 US Open. From the2002 French Opento the2003 Australian Open, she was dominant, winning all four major singles titles (each time over Venus in the final) to achieve anon-calendar year Grand Slamand thecareer Grand Slam, known as the 'Serena Slam'. The next few years saw her claim two more singles majors, but suffer from injury and decline in form. Beginning in 2007, however, she gradually returned to form despite continued injuries, retaking the world No. 1 singles ranking. Beginning at the2012 Wimbledon Championships, Williams returned to dominance, claimingOlympic gold(completing the Career Golden Slam in singles)[20]and winning eight out of thirteen singles majors, including all four in a row from 2014–15 to achieve a second "Serena Slam". At the2017 Australian Open, she won her 23rd major singles title, surpassingSteffi Graf's Open Era record. She then took a break from professional tennis after becoming pregnant and reached four major finals upon returning to play. In August 2022, Williams announced her impending "evolution" away from professional tennis and played what was expected to be her final match at the2022 US Open.[21]Williams also won 14 major women's doubles titles, all with her sister Venus, and the pair was unbeaten in major doubles finals (the best unbeaten record in major finals in any discipline of the sport).[22][23]The pair achieved a non-calendar year Grand Slam between the2009 Wimbledon Championshipsand the2010 French Open, which granted the sisters thedoubles world No. 1 ranking. Serena won fourOlympic gold medals, three in women's doubles—an all-time joint record in tennis, shared with her sister.[24][25]The duo are the only women in the Open Era to win Olympic gold in both singles and doubles.[26]She also won two major mixed doubles titles, both in 1998. She is the only singles player, male or female, to complete three Career Golden Slams – one in women's singles and two in same-sex doubles.[19]The arrival of theWilliams sistershas been credited with ushering in a new era of power and athleticism on the women's professional tennis tour.[27][28][29][30]Serena holds a combined 39 major titles: 23 in singles, 14 in women's doubles, and two in mixed doubles. She isjoint-third on the all-time listand second in the Open Era for total major titles. She is the most recent woman to simultaneously hold all four major singles titles (2002–03 and 2014–15), and the most recent woman to win theSurface Slam(major titles onhard,clayandgrasscourts in the same calendar year), doing so in 2015. She is also, with Venus, the most recent player to have simultaneously held all four major women's doubles titles (2009–10).Williams was the world's highest paid woman athlete in 2016, earning almost $29 million.[31]She repeated this feat in 2017 when she was the only woman onForbes'list of the 100 highest-paid athletes, with $27million in prize money and endorsements. She won theLaureus Sportswoman of the Yearaward a record four times (2003, 2010, 2016, 2018), and in December 2015 was namedSportsperson of the YearbySports Illustratedmagazine.[32]She is the highest-earning woman athlete of all time.[33]Early lifeWilliams was born on September 26, 1981, inSaginaw, MichigantoOracene PriceandRichard Williams. She is the youngest of Price's five daughters: half-sistersYetunde, Lyndrea, and Isha Price, and full older sisterVenus.[1]She also has at least seven paternal half-siblings.[34][35]When the children were young, the family moved toCompton, California, where she started playing tennis at age four.[36][37]Her father home-schooled her and her sister, Venus.[38][39]While he and subsequently her mother have been their official coaches, her other mentors have included Richard Williams, a Compton man who shared her father's name and subsequently founded The Venus and Serena Williams Tennis Tutorial Academy.[40]Williams sisters at aPam Shriverevent in Baltimore, 1993When Williams was nine, she and her family moved from Compton toWest Palm Beach, Florida[36]so she could attend the tennis academy ofRick Macci, who provided her with additional coaching. Macci did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls".[41]Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, as he wanted them to "go slowly" and focus on school work. Experiences of racism also influenced this decision, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments.[42]At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on theUnited States Tennis Associationjunior tour and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida.[43]In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether it would have been more beneficial for them to have followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit, Williams responded, "Everyone does different things. I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us."[43]Professional career1995–1998: Professional debutWilliams' parents wanted their daughter to wait until she was 16 to participate in professional tournaments.[44]In 1995, just after turning 14, Williams planned to make her professional debut as awild-cardentry in theBank of the West ClassicinOakland, California, but was denied by the WTA owing to their age-eligibility restrictions.[45]She subsequently filed an antitrust lawsuit against the women's tour, but withdrew it at her parents' request.[45]Her first professional event was in October 1995 at theBell ChallengeinQuebec,[44][46]where she used a wild-card entry to circumvent age-eligibility rules.[44]She lost in the first qualifying round to then 18-year-old AmericanAnnie Miller, winning just two games.[47]Williams did not play a tournament in 1996. The next year, she lost in the qualifying rounds of three tournaments,[48]before winning her first main-draw match in November at theAmeritech Cup Chicago.[49]Ranked No. 304, she upset No. 7Mary Pierce, and No. 4Monica Seles,[50][51]recording her first career wins over top10 players and becoming the lowest-ranked player in the Open Era to defeat two top-10 opponents in one tournament.[1]She ultimately lost in the semifinals to No. 5Lindsay Davenport.[52]She finished 1997 ranked No. 99.[53]Williams began 1998 at theMedibank International Sydney.[54]As a qualifier ranked No. 96,[55]she defeated No. 3 Davenport in the quarterfinals,[55]before losing toArantxa Sánchez Vicarioin the semifinals.[56]Williams made her debut in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament at theAustralian Open,[57]where she defeated sixth-seededIrina Spîrleain the first round,[58]before losing to her sister, Venus, in the second round in the sisters' first professional match.[58][54]She reached six other quarterfinals during the year, but lost all of them,[59]including her first match against No. 1-rankedMartina Hingisat theLipton International Players Championshipsin Key Biscayne,[60]and her second match against Venus at theItalian Openin Rome.[59]She failed to reach the quarterfinals of any Grand Slam tournament the remainder of the year,[citation needed]losing in the fourth round of the French Open to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario,[61]and the third round of theUS Opento Spîrlea.[62]She withdrew fromWimbledontwo games into a match withVirginia Ruano Pascual, after straining a calf muscle during the first set.[63]She did win the mixed doubles titles atWimbledonand theUS OpenwithMax Mirnyi, completing the Williams family's sweep of the 1998 mixed doubles Grand Slam tournaments. She won her first professional title in doubles at theU.S. National Indoor Championshipsin Oklahoma City with Venus, becoming the third pair of sisters to win a WTA title.[1]They won two more doubles titles that year. Williams finished the year ranked No. 20 in singles.[citation needed]Battle of the sexes: Karsten Braasch vs. the Williams sistersMain article:Battle of the Sexes (tennis)A 16-year-old Serena and her sister Venus competed in a tennis "Battle of the Sexes" againstKarsten Braaschat the 1998 Australian Open.[64]At the time Braasch was 203rd in the ATP rankings. The sisters had claimed they could beat any man outside the top 200, and accepted his challenge. Braasch beat both of them, playing one set against each. The score versus Serena was 6–1 and 6–2 against Venus.[65]Braasch said afterward, "500 and above, no chance." The sisters later tweaked the number to beating men outside the top 350.[66]1999–2001: Becoming a top-10 playerWilliams lost in the third round of the1999 Australian OpentoSandrine Testud. A month later, Williams won her first professional singles title when she defeatedAmélie Mauresmoin the final of theOpen Gaz de Francein Paris. With Venus also winning theIGA Superthrift Classicin Memphis, Tennessee, that day, the pair became the first sisters to win professional tournaments in the same week.[67]In March of that year, at theEvert Cupin California, Williams won her firstTier Ititle, defeatingSteffi Grafin the final. Soon afterward at theMiami Masters, Williams had her 16-match winning streak ended by her sister in the first all-sister singles final in WTA history,[54]and she then made her top-10 debut, at No. 9. She then lost in the quarterfinals of theItalian Open[68]and theGerman Open,[69]and the third round of theFrench Open,[70]where she and Venus won the women's doubles title.[54]Williams then missedWimbledonbecause of injury. When she returned to the tour, Williams won aFed Cupsingles match and then won theJPMorgan Chase Openin Los Angeles, beatingJulie Halard-Decugisin the final. She then defeated in succession Grand Slam championsKim Clijsters,Conchita Martínez,Monica Seles, and defending champion Lindsay Davenport to reach theUS Openfinal, where she defeated No. 1, Hingis, to become the second African-American woman, afterAlthea Gibsonin 1958, to win a Grand Slam singles tournament.[1]The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at this tournament. To complete her 1999 season, Williams won a doubles match in the Fed Cup final against Russia. Williams ended the year ranked No. 4 in just her second full year on the main tour.[71]Williams started 2000 by losing in the fourth round of theAustralian OpentoElena Likhovtseva. She failed to defend her titles in Paris and Indian Wells, although she did win theFaber Grand Prixin Germany. Soon afterwards, Williams missed theFrench Openbecause of injury. She returned from injury at theWimbledon Championships, where she lost to Venus in the semifinals, but the pair won the doubles title at the event. Williams successfully defended her title in Los Angeles, defeating Davenport in the final. She reached the final of theDu Maurier Openwhere an injury forced her to retire from her match with Hingis. Her defense of theUS Opentitle ended when she lost in the quarterfinals to Davenport. Williams teamed with Venus to win the gold medal in doubles at theSydney Olympicsthat September. She ended the year winning theToyota Princess Cupin Japan and she finished the year ranked No. 6.[citation needed]Williams began 2001 losing to Martina Hingis in the quarterfinals of the Medibank International inSydneyand the Australian Open in Melbourne. Williams and her sister won the doubles title at the latter tournament, becoming only the fifth doubles team in history to win all four Grand Slam women's doubles titles during their career, completing a "Career Grand Slam". Her next event was thePacific Life Openin California, where she defeated Kim Clijsters in the final. The final was marred by the behavior of the crowd toward Williams and her family. Crowd members were incensed at the perceived match-fixing of games involving the family afterVenus withdrewbefore their semifinal. Neither Williams nor her sister entered the tournament for fourteen years until Williams entered in 2015 as a wildcard (and the top seed).[72]The following week at theEricsson Openin Miami, Williams lost toJennifer Capriatiin the quarterfinals. She then lost in the quarterfinals to Capriati at both theFrench OpenandWimbledon Championships. That was the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament at which Williams had exited in the quarterfinals. During the North American hard-court season, she lost in the quarterfinals ofLos Angelesagainst Monica Seles, then captured her second title of the year at theRogers Cup, defeating Capriati in the final. Williams reached the final of the 2001 US Open, losing to sister Venus. That was the first Grand Slam tournament final contested by two sisters during the Open Era. At the 2001 season-endingTour Championships, Williams won the championship by walkover when Davenport withdrew before the start of the final because of a knee injury. Williams finished 2001 at No. 6 for the second straight year.[citation needed]2002–2003: "Serena Slam"Early 2002, injury saw Williams retire from the semifinal at theMedibank International Sydneyand later withdraw from theAustralian Open.[73]Playing Amélie Mauresmo in the quarterfinals of the tournament in Sydney in 2002Returning from injury, Williams won her first title of the year inScottsdale, Arizona, defeating No. 2 Jennifer Capriati, in the final. She then won the Miami Masters for the first time, becoming one of three players in the Open Era to defeat the world's top 3 ranked players at one tournament,[1]after beating No. 3, Martina Hingis, in the quarterfinals, No. 2 Venus in the semifinals, and the top-ranked player, Capriati, in the final. Serena's straight set win over Venus was her second career win over her sister.[citation needed]Williams played three clay-court tournaments before the2002 French Open. Her first tournament was atCharleston, where she was the third seed. Williams reached the quarterfinals before losing toPatty Schnyder. She reached her first clay-court final in May, at theEurocard German Openlosing toJustine Heninin a third set tiebreak. Williams went on to win her first clay court title at theItalian Open, defeating Capriati in the semifinals and Henin in the final.[74]This raised her ranking to a new high of No. 3. Williams was the third seed at the French Open at Roland Garros, where she claimed her first title thereby defeating defending champion Capriati in the semifinals and sister Venus in the final to win her second Grand Slam tournament title (and her first in two-and-a-half years). As a result of raising the trophy atCourt Philippe Chatrier, Williams rose to a career-high of No. 2, second only to Venus.[citation needed]At the2002 Wimbledon Championships, Williams won tennis's oldest championship for the first time in her life, defeating Venus to win a Grand Slam singles title without dropping a set for the first time in her career. This victory earned Williams the world No. 1 ranking for the first time, dethroning her sister and becoming only the third African American woman to hold that ranking.[1]The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at the tournament, the fifth Grand Slam doubles title for the pair. Williams played just one tournament between Wimbledon and theUS Open, losing in the quarterfinals of theJPMorgan Chase Openin Los Angeles to AmericanChanda Rubinand ending a 21-match winning streak. The top-seeded player at the US Open, Williams reached the final where, for the third Grand Slam in a row, she defeated her sister to win the title, the second US Open crown of her career. Williams won two consecutive singles titles in the fall, defeating Kim Clijsters to win theToyota Princess Cupin Tokyo, andAnastasia Myskinato win theSparkassen Cupin Leipzig, Germany. She reached the final at the year-endHome Depot Championshipsat theStaples Centerin Los Angeles, where she lost to fifth-seeded Clijsters in straight sets, ending an 18-match winning streak.[citation needed]Williams finished 2002 with a 56–5 W/L record, eight singles titles, and the No. 1 ranking. She was the first African-American to end a year with that ranking sinceAlthea Gibsonin 1958[citation needed]and was the first woman to win three Grand Slam tournament titles in one year since Hingis in 1997.[1]Her three consecutive Grand Slam titles to close 2002 also made Williams only the third player in tennis history to win the "Surface Slam",[75]three Slam titles on three surfaces in the same calendar year, after Navratilova (1984) and Graf (1993, 1995, 1996).[citation needed]At the2003 Australian Open, Williams reached the tournament's semifinals for the first time, where she recovered from 5–1 down in the third set and saved two match points before defeating Clijsters. In the final, Serena faced Venus for the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament final, defeating her older sister to become the sixth woman in the Open Era to complete a career Grand Slam, alongsideMargaret Court,Billie Jean King,Chris Evert,Martina Navratilova, andSteffi Graf. She also became the fifth woman to hold all Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously, joiningMaureen Connolly Brinker, Court, Graf, and Navratilova. This feat was dubbed the "Serena Slam" by the press.[76][77]TheWilliams sisterswon their sixth Grand Slam doubles title together at this event.[78]During the spring of 2003, Williams captured the singles titles at theOpen Gaz de Franceand theSony Ericsson Open. Williams's winning streak came to an end when she lost the final of theFamily Circle Cupto Henin, her first loss of the year after 21 wins. She also lost to Mauresmo in the semifinals of theInternazionali BNL d'Italiain Rome. Despite these losses, Williams was the top seed at theFrench Open, where she lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Henin, marking Williams's first loss in a Grand Slam tournament since 2001. The match was controversial, as Williams questioned Henin's sportsmanship, and spectators applauded Williams's errors.[79]Williams rebounded from the French Open loss a couple weeks later at the2003 Wimbledon Championships, defeating Henin in the semifinals and Venus in the final. This was Williams's second consecutive Wimbledon title and her sixth Grand Slam singles title overall. Wimbledon was Williams's last tournament of 2003; she pulled out of three events in the US and then underwent surgery on the quadriceps tendon in her knee in early August. Williams was initially expected to be out for six to eight weeks.[80]2004–2007: Injuries and the comebackMain articles:2004,2005,2006, and2007 Serena Williams tennis seasonAfter eight months away from the tour, during which time her desire was questioned,[81]Williams began her comeback at the 2004NASDAQ-100 Openin Miami in March, where she made a triumphant return as she won the title for the third consecutive year.Delivering a serve at an exhibition in November 2004Although ranked No. 7, Williams was seeded second at the French Open, where, after winning four matches, she lost to Capriati in the quarterfinals. That was the first time that Williams had lost before the semifinals at a Grand Slam singles tournament since Wimbledon in 2001. A few weeks later, even though her ranking had dropped to No. 10, Williams was seeded first atWimbledon. She won six matches en route to the final, where 13th-seededMaria Sharapovadefeated her in straight sets. This loss caused her ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the first time since 1999. Later that summer, Williams reached her third final of the year at the JPMorgan Chase Open in Los Angeles where she lost to Lindsay Davenport which was her first loss to the American since the 2000 US Open. After missing her national championship in 2003, Williams returned for the2004 US Open, where she was seeded third despite her No. 11 ranking. She lost in the U.S. Open quarterfinals to Capriati in three sets in controversial fashion.[82]That fall, Williams won her second title of the year, at theChina Open, defeating US Open championSvetlana Kuznetsovain the final. Williams's successful season allowed her to qualify for theTour Championships, held again in Los Angeles. In the round-robin phase of the tournament, Williams defeated Dementieva andAnastasia Myskinaand lost to Davenport, but still advanced to the elimination stage.

With a world ranking at the time of 181,[257]many felt that the decision showed bias and favored Williams unduly.[258]Others argued that theAll England Club, who do not base their seedings on players' current world rankings – as other grand slam tournaments do– had sensibly considered Williams's excellent historic record there. Williams herself said: "I was pleasantly surprised. I came in here expecting that maybe I wouldn't get a seed."[258]Her seeding resulted inDominika Cibulkoválosing her place to be seeded.[citation needed]By the second week of the tournament, for the first time in grand slam history, none of the top ten seeded women players had made it to the quarterfinals.[259]En route to the quarterfinals, Williams had beatenArantxa Rusof Holland in round one,Viktoriya Tomovaof Bulgaria in round 2,Kristina Mladenovicof France in round 3 andEvgeniya Rodinaof Russia in round 4.[260]She had not lost a set in any of her matches till then.

Owing to her high-risk playing style, she typically hits a large number of both winners and unforced errors. Williams' greatest asset is her serve, which is considered the greatest in the history of women's tennis. Her serve is known for its fast pace and accurate placement, allowing her to serve numerous aces: at the2013 Australian Open, she served a 128.6 mph (207 km/h) ace in her third round match againstAyumi Morita, which is the third fastest serve recorded in WTA history.[305]Williams possesses an accurate and consistent ball toss, allowing her to serve to any position on the court with minimal differences in the position of the ball in the air; this makes it difficult for opponents to read her service motion and predict the position of her serve, allowing her to dominate a rally from the first stroke.[306]Williams also possesses effective and accurate kick and slice serves, which she deploys as second serves, minimizing double faults, and preventing opponents from scoring free points.[307]Williams is also known for her forceful groundstrokes, which are considered two of the most powerful shots in the history of women's tennis.[308]She hits both her forehand and her backhand in an open stance, allowing her to generate consistently powerful, heavy, and dominating groundstrokes, and to generate sharp, acute angles, which allow her to hit winners from any position on the court.[309]Williams is known for her forehand, which has been described as "devastating".[310]Her forehand is hit with heavy topspin; this allows her to dominate rallies, and she is capable of hitting her forehand both crosscourt and down the line to produce winners.[311]Her two-handed backhand is equally dominant, and has been described as one of the greatest backhands of all time.[312]Williams tends to hit her backhand flatter than her forehand, allowing her to hit her backhand with speed, power, and depth both crosscourt and down the line. Despite playing primarily from the baseline, Williams is an adept net player thanks to her extensive doubles experience, and will frequently choose to finish points at the net, either with deft touch, aggressive drive volleys, or a solid, powerful, and reliable overhead smash.[313]Williams possesses an aggressive return of serve – she neutralizes powerful first serves, and attacks weak second serves. She is widely considered one of the greatest return players of all time.[314]Despite predominantly employing an aggressive game style, she is also an excellent defender, and is capable of counterpunching against aggressive opponents until she creates an opportunity to hit a winner. She is an exceptional athlete, known for her movement, speed, court coverage, agility, flexibility, balance, and footwork. Her on-court intelligence, shot selection, and point construction allow her to execute her gamestyle effectively.[315]She has been praised for her mental strength and competitive spirit, with her being described as one of the toughest opponents to beat on the court;Martina Navratilovadeclared her mental strength "unbelievable",[316]whilst tennis journalistJon Wertheimclaimed that Williams is the toughest player of all time.[317]American tennis playerChristina McHalepraised her composure in high pressure moments, stating that, for Williams, "being clutch is like breathing", and that she "seems to come through every single time in the most pressure-packed situations".[318]She has been noted for her ability to produce extraordinary comebacks, particularly on the Grand Slam level, winning three Slams after saving match points, a feat achieved more often than by any other player in tennis history.[319]Williams bounced back from a set down to win 37 Grand Slam matches; her ability to come back from set and break deficits in Grand Slam matches was described byJohn McEnroeas "a gift", and McEnroe declared that she was "the greatest" competitor in the history of women's tennis.[320]She has also been praised for her ability to serve aces at critical moments. As noted by retired playerLi Nain 2016, "break point down, [there is an] 80% chance [she] serves an ace".[321]Owing to her exceptional serve, powerful groundstrokes, technical mastery, aggressive return of serve, athleticism, and mental strength, Williams has been described as one of the most complete players on tour, and one of the greatest players of all time, irrespective of gender.[322]Williams has stated that her favourite surface is clay, as the slow pace and high bounce afforded aids point construction, although she also excels on faster hard and grass courts.[323]RivalriesSerena vs. VenusMain article:Williams sisters rivalryWilliams played older sisterVenusin 31 professional matches since 1998.[54]Overall, Serena is 19–12 against her sister.[54]Serena played Venus 15 times in Grand Slam singles and 13 times in other tournaments (including 11 finals).[324]They have met in nine Grand Slam tournament finals, with Serena winning seven times.[54]Beginning with the2002 French Open, they played each other in four consecutive Grand Slam finals, which was the first time in the Open Era that the same two players had contested four consecutive finals in Grand Slam singles.[325]Williams vs. HingisMain article:Hingis–S.

Williams rivalryWilliams leads the series 8–6.Justine Heninand Williams met 14 times, five of which were in tournament finals. In majors they have faced each other seven times with Henin leading 4–3.[333]Opposite personalities and styles of play are often cited as what made their rivalry entertaining.[334][335]In the semifinals of the2003 French Open, when at 4–2, 30–0 on Williams's serve in the third set, Henin raised her hand to indicate she was not ready to receive; Williams then put her serve into the net. The umpire did not see Henin raise her hand, and thus did not allow Williams a first serve. Williams lost the game and would go on to lose the match. Their last match took place in the final of the2010 Australian Openwhere Williams won in three sets to take her 12th major title.[333]Williams vs. AzarenkaWilliams leads the series 18–5. The rivalry began at the 2008 Australian Open, and their most recent match was in the semifinals of the 2020 US Open. Williams holds a 10–1 record in Grand Slams. Azarenka is the only person to ever win four WTA tour level finals against Williams.[336]While their rivalry is heavily favored towards Williams, their matches are known for their fierce competitiveness, and Azarenka is considered the only player to truly challenge Williams following the retirement of Capriati, Henin, and Hingis, with 9 of their matches extending to three sets.[337]Williams vs. SharapovaWilliams leads the series 20–2. The pair first met in the fourth round of the2004 Miami Open, where Williams defeated Sharapova 6–4, 6–3. Their rivalry truly began at the2004 Wimbledon final, where Williams was the two-time defending champion; Sharapova upset her 6–1, 6–4. Williams next lost to Sharapova in the finals of the2004 WTA Tour Championships, 6–4, 2–6, 4–6. Since then, however, Williams dominated the rivalry, winning all of their clashes, with only three of their matches going to three sets. They met 10 times in Grand Slam tournaments, where Williams led 9–1, and they further met in 9 finals, with Williams leading 7–2. Sharapova retired in February 2020, with their final match being in the first round of the2019 US Open; Williams defeated Sharapova 6–1, 6–1 in one hour exactly. Despite the one-sided nature of their rivalry, it is considered one of the most prominent rivalries on the WTA Tour of the 21st century, due to alleged personality clashes, similarly aggressive playing styles, and significant media interest.[338]Match controversiesAccusations of match fixingWhen both of the Williams sisters entered the top ten and started meeting in tournaments, rumors ofmatch fixingstarted to circulate.John McEnroe, while commenting on the 2000 Wimbledon semifinal between the two sisters, said that "Serena may not be allowed to win. Richard [Williams] may have something to say about this."[339]After losing to Venus at the Indian Wells quarterfinals in 2001,Elena Dementievaasserted during a post-match interview that Richard Williams decided the results of matches between the two sisters.[340]Shortly after that, Venus Williams pulled out of her Indian Wells semifinal match against Serena Williams at the last minute, claimingtendinitis; this occurrence garnered much speculation in the press, and some fans demanded their money back.[341][342][343]Indian Wells boycottAt the 2001 Ericsson Open the following week, Richard Williams stated that racist comments were made to him in the stands,[344]and the tournament director refused to offer Williams an apology for how he was treated.[citation needed]As a result, neither sister played the tournament even though it had become a mandatory stop on the WTA tour since 2009. In 2015, Williams decided to end her 14-year boycott and played.[345]2004 US OpenIn herUS Openquarterfinal match againstJennifer Capriati, an incorrect overrule was made by chair umpireMariana Alves; the video review showed that Williams's shot landed in bounds. In the same match, new technology being tested made incorrect line calls late in the third set. Williams argued with the chair over a couple of calls during the match, but was not successful. Capriati won the match, with Serena herself acknowledging that this was primarily due to her 57 unforced errors; nevertheless, she accused Alves of temporary insanity[346]and said that she "felt cheated".[347]In a post-match interview Capriati sharply observed that bad calls had gone against her in the past as well. Alves did not officiate for the remainder of the tournament; this was not punitive, as commonly thought, as she was not scheduled to officiate.[348]The controversy renewed calls for, and was widely given credit for, the adoption of technology such as theMacCAMandHawk-Eyesystems.[349]2009 US OpenIn theUS Opensemifinal round againstKim Clijsters, Williams slammed her racket on the court after losing the first set. She was given a warning, with a potential second violation carrying a one-point penalty. While trailing 4–6, 5–6, 15–30, Williams's second serve was called afoot fault, resulting in two match points for Clijsters. Williams gestured with her racket to the lineswoman who had made the call and yelled at her, with profanities and a threat to shove a tennis ball down the lineswoman's throat.[350]During the subsequent on-court conference between the chair umpire, the lineswoman, US Open officials, and Williams, a television microphone picked up Williams saying to the lineswoman, "I didn't say I would kill you! Are you serious?"[351]The incident resulted in Williams being penalized a point for unsportsmanlike conduct‍—‌necessitated by the earlier warning for racket abuse‍—‌meaning Clijsters won the match 6–4, 7–5. The following day, Williams was issued the maximum permissible on-site fine of $10,000 (plus $500 for racket abuse). After further investigation, the Grand Slam Committee in November 2009 fined her $175,000 in place of suspending her from the 2010 US Open or other Grand Slam events.[352]They also placed her on a two-year probation which provided that if Williams committed another offense at a Grand Slam event in the next two years, she would be suspended from participating in the following US Open. If, however, she committed no offenses within the next two years, her fine would be reduced to $82,500.[352]Williams initially refused to apologize for her outburst, both in her post-match press conference[353]and in an official statement released the following day.[124]She eventually did apologize, stating "I just really wanted to apologize sincerely because I'm a very prideful person, and I'm a very intense person and a very emotional person", and "I wanted to offer my sincere apologies to anyone that I may have offended." She said she was humbled by the experience.[354]2011 US OpenIn the final of the2011 US OpenagainstSamantha Stosur, Williams shouted "Come on!" as the Australian attempted to return aforehandWilliams believed to be a winner. The chair umpireEva Asderakiawarded the point to Stosur based on theITF's deliberate hindrance rule, which states, "If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if involuntary, the point shall be replayed."[355]As the point was 30–40 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur. Williams became angry with the chair umpire and made several gestures and unflattering comments toward her during the next changeover, including telling Asderaki that if the umpire ever saw Serena coming toward her, she should "look the other way".[356]Williams initially gained momentum in the set following the penalty, breaking back in the next game, but eventually flagged and lost the match, 2–6, 3–6. At the end of the match, she declined to offer the customary handshake to Asderaki.[357][358]Williams mentioned the incident in her post-match speech as the tournament runner-up, asserting, "I hit a winner, but I guess it didn't count", but added, "It wouldn't have mattered in the end. Sam played well."[359]A writer forESPNsuggested that Williams could avoid being found to have violated the terms of the "probation" on which she was placed following her 2009 outburst, as she did not appear to have usedprofanityin addressing Asderaki during the match.[360]In the end, Williams was fined $2,000 and was not barred from competing in the2012 US Openbecause "Williams' conduct, while verbally abusive, does not rise to the level of a major offense under the Grand Slam Code of Conduct."[361]2018 US OpenWilliams's2018 US Openended in controversy with Williams falling toNaomi Osakain straight sets following a game penalty in the second set of thefinal. During that second set, she was given a code violation because her coach,Patrick Mouratoglou, gave her coaching hand signals. Williams was upset by the violation, claiming that her coach was simply giving her a thumbs up, and demanded an apology from chair umpireCarlos Ramos. Mouratoglou later admitted that he was coaching.[362]She received a second violation for smashing her racket on the court, which resulted in a point penalty. After her third code violation for verbal abuse against the umpire, Williams was assessed a game penalty.[363][364]Williams said that she believed she was treated unfairly by the umpire because she is a woman.[365]Williams was fined a total of $17,000 including $4,000 for a coaching violation, $3,000 for racket abuse and $10,000 for verbal abuse towards the umpire.[366]Other issuesIn the beginning years of Williams' professional career, hair beads donned by the Williams sisters were the focus of discussion by commentators such as Chris Evert and John McEnroe, with Mary Carillo characterizing their hair as "noisy and disruptive".[367]The beads often broke and scattered across the court. Scholar Nancy E. Spencer said that commentary that dismissed the Williams' cultural hairstyles served to"other"the sisters, particularly in the context of a white dominated sport where their appearance and specifically their physicality is a popular topic for discussion.[367]Following the match controversy at the 2018 US Open final between Williams and Naomi Osaka, the Melbourne newspaper theHerald Sunpublished a cartoon byMark Knightdepicting Williams having a tantrum and breaking her racket while the umpire asks her opponent to "just let her win".[368]The cartoon was widely criticized as racist and sexist, including by Williams's husband, Reddit co-founderAlexis Ohanian, and authorJ. K. Rowling.[369][370]Complaints centered around the portrayal of Williams as an angry black woman with exaggerated large lips, a broad flat nose, and positioned in an ape-like pose, and the portrayal of Williams's opponent, Osaka, who is half-Japanese, half-Haitian, with blonde hair.[371]The editor of the Herald Sun argued the cartoon was unfairly criticized on social media.[372]Knight defended his work, saying that his satire was never about race or gender, but was about putting a spotlight on bad behavior by sporting superstars. In the immediate aftermath of the controversy he suspended his Twitter account to "protect his family and friends".[372]In September 2019, Romanian television host Radu Banciu made the following comments during a live broadcast: "Serena Williams looks exactly like one of those monkeys at the zoo with the red asses."[373]Romania'sNational Council for Combating Discriminationfined Banciu approximately $1,875 for his comments.LegacyWilliams is considered one of the best female tennis players of all time. In 2017,BBC Sportusers picked Williams as the greatest female tennis player of the Open Era. BBC presenter and former French Open Champion,Sue Barker, said "Serena is the greatest because this era is so much more competitive than previous eras. The pace she generates – her serve is without question the greatest ever – combined with her movement and her power, she pushes her opponents constantly on the back foot".[374]In 2018, a Tennis.com panel selected Serena as thegreatest female tennis player in the Open Era.[375]Some commentators, players and sports writers regard Williams as the greatest woman tennis player of all time.[b]In 2018,Federersaid the player who probably had the best case for tennis "Greatest Of All Time", man or woman, was Serena Williams.[377]In 2020, the Tennis Channel ranked Williams as the greatest woman tennis player of all time.[378]In 2022,John McEnroedescribed Williams as an "icon" and the "GOAT of GOATs".[379][380]Alongside her sisterVenus, Williams has been widely credited with increasing diversity within the sport:[381][382][383]It all starts with Venus and Serena. The demonstration effect. The power of seeing two African-American girls with braids in the finals of the biggest tournaments in the world in a predominantly white sport. Just a huge impact that really can't be overstated. That attracted thousands of girls into the sport, not just African-American but all backgrounds and races.

The family included her parents—Oracene Price, a nurse, and Richard Williams, who founded a security service—andVenus Williams, her older sister. Price also had three daughters from a previous marriage. While both parents encouraged Serena and Venus Williams to play tennis, it was Richard Williams who largely taught them the sport, taking the two girls to the public courts in the area. He was known as a strict coach, and the sisters spent long hours practicing. In 1991 the family moved to Florida so that Serena and Venus Williams couldattenda tennis academy. Serena Williams turned professional in 1995, one year after her older sister. Possessing powerful serves and ground strokes and superb athleticism, they soon attracted much attention. Many predicted that Venus would be the first Williams sister to win a Grand Slam singles title, but it was Serena who accomplished the feat, winning the 1999 U.S. Open. At that tournament the sisters won the doubles event, and, over the course of their careers, the two teamed up for 14 Grand Slam doubles titles.Britannica QuizWomen in Sports: Who Said It?Serena Williams and Venus WilliamsSerena WilliamsAt the2000 Olympic Gamesin Sydney,Australia, Serena and Venus Williams won gold medals in the doubles event. After several years of inconsistent play, Serena Williamsassertedherself in 2002 and won theFrench Open,Wimbledon, and theU.S. Open, defeating Venus Williams in the finals of each tournament. At the latter tournament, Serena Williams also garnered attention by wearing a catsuit. Long interested in fashion, Williams became noted for bold outfits that highlighted her strength and challenged traditional—and typically conservative—dress codes. Displaying her trademark tenacity, Williams won theAustralian Openin 2003 and thus completed a career Grand Slam by having won all four of the slam’s component tournaments. Later that year she was also victorious at Wimbledon; both of her Grand Slam wins in 2003 came after she had bested her sister in the finals. In 2005 Williams won the Australian Open again. Beset by injury the following year, she rebounded in 2007 to win her third Australian Open. Serena and Venus Williams won their second doubles tennis gold medal at the2008 Olympic Gamesin Beijing. Later that year Serena Williams won the U.S. Open for a third time. In 2009 she captured her 10th Grand Slam singles title by winning the Australian Open. Later that year she won her third Wimbledon singles title, once again defeating her sister. Williams defended her titles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2010. She subsequently battled various health issues that kept her off the court for almost a year.Serena WilliamsIn 2012 Williams captured her fifth Wimbledon singles title. A month later at theLondon Olympic Games, she won a gold medal in the singles event, becoming the second woman (behindSteffi Graf) to win a career Golden Slam. She also teamed with her sister to win the doubles event. Later that year Williams claimed her 15th Grand Slam singles title with a victory at the U.S. Open. In 2013 she won her second French Open singles championship and fifth U.S. Open singles title. Williams successfully defended her U.S. Open championship in 2014, which gave her 18 career Grand Slam titles, tying her withChris EvertandMartina Navratilovafor the second highest women’s singles total of the open era. The following year she captured her sixth Australian Open. Williams then won the 2015 French Open—her 20th total Grand Slam singles championship. She continued hertorridstreak at Wimbledon, winning a straight-set final to capture her sixth career Wimbledon singles title. Williams again won Wimbledon in 2016, giving her 22 career Grand Slam singles titles, which tied her with Graf for the most Slams in the open era for both women and men. Williams broke Graf’s record at the 2017 Australian Open, where she defeated her sister in the final.Serena Williams and her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr.In April 2017, Williams announced that she was pregnant (she had gotten engaged to Alexis Ohanian, cofounder of the website Reddit, in December 2016) and would miss the remainder of the 2017 season. In September she gave birth to a daughter, and two months later she married Ohanian. Williams returned to tennis in March 2018. She failed to win a tournament that year, though she reached the finals at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. The latter loss proved controversial as Williams was penalized a game after arguing with the chair umpire over a code violation. In 2019 she was again defeated in the finals at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. At the 2020 ASB Classic in Auckland,New Zealand, Williams won her first singles event in some three years.Williams reached the semifinals of the 2021 Australian Open but lost toNaomi Osaka. Later that year she was forced towithdrawfrom both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open because of injuries. After missing the first half of the 2022 season, Williams competed at Wimbledon but was defeated in the first round. She later wasinterviewed forVoguemagazineand revealed that she would be retiring after the upcoming U.S. Open. Williams stated that she was “evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.”Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.Subscribe NowWilliams’s activities outside of tennis include ventures relating to fashion, beauty, and accessories.

With 23 Grand Slam titles, Williams rose from the public courts of Compton, California to shatter records and dominate the field.Serena Jameka Williams was born to parents Richard Williams and Oracene Price on September 26, 1981 in Saginaw, Michigan. Williams is the youngest of Price's five daughters, who include fellow tennis superstar Venus Williams. Richard Williams, a former sharecropper from Louisiana, was determined that daughters Serena and Venus would succeed in life. Seeing opportunity in tennis, he and Oracene taught themselves the game from books and videos so that they could coach their children. Richard moved the family to Compton, California, where Williams began intensive tennis training with her father and older sister around the age of three. The Williams sisters practiced for hours every day on rundown public tennis courts.Williams joined the junior United States Tennis Association tour and by 1991 she ranked first in the 10-and-under division. Richard then moved the family to Palm Beach, Florida, where the sisters trained with coach Rick Macci. Richard kept Williams and her sister from competing in the junior tournaments, hoping to ensure that they would not burn out before turning professional.In 1995, at the age of 14, Williams made her professional debut at a qualifying event in Quebec City. Fellow American Annie Miller defeated her soundly. Williams did not play another professional match until 1997, but by the end of that year she rose to number 99 in the world rankings. In 1998, Williams’s ranking rose to number 20 and she surpassed Monica Seles to become the fastest player to record five victories against Top 10 players.Williams graduated from Driftwood Academy in 1999 and soon after signed a $12 million endorsement deal with Puma. She won her first Grand Slam title that year, when she defeated Martina Hingis 6-3, 7–6 to win the U.S. Open, and rose to number four in the world rankings. Two years later, Williams lost to her sister in the U.S. Open final – it was the first time that sisters played against each other in a Grand Slam final since 1884.The African-American Williams and her sister made an immediate impact in the predominately white tennis world: their strength and athleticism on the court overmatched many opponents and their colorful, fashionable styles garnered media attention. The Williams sisters are credited with ushering in the power era of women’s tennis, characterized by blindingly-fast serves and commanding groundstrokes. They competed together as doubles partners, eventually winning 14 Grand Slam doubles titles. They took gold at the 2000, 2008, and 2012 Olympics and are the winningest doubles tennis team in Olympic history.In 2001, Williams won California’s Indian Wells tournament for the second time. Williams, along with her father and sister who were watching in the stands, claimed spectators hurled racial slurs their way while booing them. Williams later described the racist treatment as traumatizing and she boycotted the tournament until 2015.Williams continued to amass victories and rise in the rankings. In 2002, she won her second, third, and fourth Grand Slam titles at Roland-Garros (the French Open), Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open, respectively. In each of those tournaments, she defeated her sister Venus in the final match. On July 8, 2002 she reached the ranking of number one in the world, a position she held for 57 straight weeks. In 2003, Williams won her first Australian Open, becoming one of only six women in the Open Era (post-1968) to complete a career Grand Slam (in which a player wins all four major championships). Williams actually held all four titles at once, an accomplishment she dubbed “The Serena Slam.”However, 2003 also brought troubles for Williams. She underwent knee surgery in August and in September her older sister, Yetunde Price, was murdered in Los Angeles. The loss of her sister was difficult for Williams. She came back from the knee injury in the 2004 season, but other injuries plagued her for the next three years. She won the Australian Open in 2005 and 2007, but her injuries and losses resulted in her ranking dropping to number 139.In 2008, Williams began her return to championship form by winning the U.S. Open. The following year, she won the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and reclaimed her number one world ranking. Her five-year gap between number one rankings is the longest of any player ever. Williams cited her faith as a Jehovah’s Witness as well as an inspirational trip to West Africa for restoring her competitive spirit. In 2009, she faced fines and probation after an altercation with a referee at the U.S. Open, but the following year Williams added two more Grand Slam titles and finished the season ranked number four.Williams suffered from a blood clot in her lung in 2011, but returned to dominance later that year. In 2012, Williams earned a gold medal for singles’ tennis at the London Olympic Games. The 2013-2015 seasons marked her third, fourth, and fifth number-one seasons, after which she had won her 21stGrand Slam championship and completed her second Serena Slam.In 2017, Williams won the Australian Open. It was her 23rdGrand Slam title, meaning she surpassed Steffi Graf’s record for Grand Slam singles’ titles in the Open Era. A few months later, she revealed she was expecting her first child and had been pregnant when she won the Australian Open. That September, Williams gave birth to her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr., and married Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian shortly after. Williams experienced a difficult childbirth: she had an emergency cesarean section and suffered from another blood clot and other severe complications. By telling her story publicly, Williams contributed to a growing national dialogue about the disproportionately high number of Black women that suffer from pregnancy and postpartum complications.Williams returned to tennis in 2018, ranked number 549. The attention Williams brought to the issue of rankings after giving birth led the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) to take action. The WTA’s new rule allowed players who leave the sport for childbirth or injury to use their previous rankings to enter up to 12 tournaments within three years of their return. Williams, whose career winnings exceed $90 million, also advocates for female tennis players regarding equitable prize money.Outside of tennis, Williams has been busy as well. She realized her fashion design dreams when she released her clothing line (“S by Serena”) in 2018 as well as a jewelry line in 2019. She serves as a UNICEF International Goodwill Ambassador; has opened two secondary schools in Kenya; and sits on the board of the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative. She has her own venture capital firm, Serena Ventures, that invests in technology companies owned or led by women and African Americans.Williams was named the AP Female Athlete of the Decade for her dominance in the 2010s. She continues to inspire tennis hopefuls and the wider public through her hard work and pursuit of excellence on and off the court.Works CitedAllen, JA. “The Williams Sisters and the Rise of the Women's Power Game.” Bleacher Report.

As in, literally helped to build it.Enjoyable work. Serena Williams Fund's 3rd school- this time we partnered with Helping Hands Jamaica to build the Salt Marsh Primary School #swf #educationA video posted by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) onFeb 8, 2016 at 1:35pm PSTSerenaused to keep “match books”in which should would write affirmations to read to herself before matches, and one of these affirmations was to “work in Africa...help[ing] kids and...people.” And she’s been able to do that - and more.The Salt Marsh Primary School in Jamaica is one of several schools the Serena Williams Fund helped build - others are located in Kenya and Uganda - another step towards fulfilling Serena’s mission of “ensuring equal access to education.” The schools she’s building have an added bonus. They impose strict guidelines and rules to support gender equality in access to education.In Kenya, Serena’s schools are required to maintain a 40-60 ratio of girls to boys; though Serena would have liked the ratio to be totally equal, she recognized the near impossibility of achieving this balance at the time. She opted instead to implement rules that are progressive, while still feasible - in the hopes that future schools will be able to reach that 50-50 ratio.Loved meeting these amazing kids from Salt Marsh. New school thanks to#HelpingHandsJamaica#SerenaWilliamsFundpic.twitter.com/H1LEqM394y— Michelle Meneley (@MMeneley)April 23, 2016Serena’s gender ratio rules work toward addressing a major problem around the world, particularly in developing countries where girls and women frequently bear the burden of household chores, like collecting water and caregiving responsibilities, which forces girls to leave school. Around the world, women and girls spend spendapproximately 200 million hourseach day collecting water. That is time those girls could be spending in schools learning instead.Social norms and taboos may also prevent girls from going to school. In many cultures, there is a lot of stigma attached to menstruation - girls may be pulled out of school during their periods because they are considered “unclean,” or made to feel ashamed of their period and therefore choose not to go to school. Girls who regularly miss a week of school every month can quickly fall behind and give up on school altogether.If all girls were educated, childbirth mortality would decrease, female economic participation would increase, and child marriage rates would fall. But above all, these girls would have a greater quality of life - an equal quality of life.As Serena said, “...we’re making progress.But we can keep working even more to increase equality—whether it’s making sure to interview black candidates for tech jobs...standing up to cyberbullying...making sure that our technology is designed by all kinds of people. Eventually we’re going to make the world better. For everyone.”Advantage in, Serena.via GIPHYTopicsEducationKenyaUgandaSerena WilliamsGirls & womenschoolsHelping Hand JamaicaSerena Williams FundProfilesDefeat PovertySerena Williams Literally Helped Build a School in JamaicaJune 17, 2016ByDaniele SelbyEnglish (en)Deutsch (de)français (fr)español (es)

There's nothing here to indicate that this house, in this quiet neighborhood, was the childhood home of two of the best athletes of all time.Enlarge this imageSisters Serena, left, and Venus Williams shake hands after a match in 1991 in Compton, Calif.Paul Harris/Getty Imageshide captiontoggle captionPaul Harris/Getty ImagesSisters Serena, left, and Venus Williams shake hands after a match in 1991 in Compton, Calif.Paul Harris/Getty ImagesLong before the U.S. Open this week, before the Nike and Gatorade sponsorships and before the stardom, a young Venus and Serena Williams were given their first tennis rackets here.Next door, Maria Gomez leans up against her blue pickup truck. She's lived in this house since 1974, so she knew the Williams family. She says she remembers Venus and Serena running around the house and playing in the tiny backyard next door.The girls cut their teeth on courts around Compton. And to this day, the Williams sisters are a source of pride in the city."To be able to say that they're from the town that you grew up in — who wouldn't be inspired by them?" says Janna Zurita, a Compton councilwoman. She was born and raised in Compton, and says she used to watch the Williams sisters train.Code Switch'Venus And Serena': An Extraordinary Story, Told On Film"A lot of the little kids here in the community, they look up to them and they think they're great. I mean, they're two beautiful women that changed the whole life of tennis," Zurita says. "And they're straight outta Compton."Their dad, Richard Williams, was their coach back then. He was known for being tough and pushing his daughters to perfection on the court — hours on the courts, day in, day out.Some of the places where they'd practice were in rough neighborhoods, like East Rancho Dominguez Park, formerly known as East Compton Park. Today, the courts are repaved and there's a new recreation center — but that's not how it used to be.Andre Barbee says the last time he stood on the courts at East Rancho Dominguez, gang members would hang out on park benches just outside the fence."You see them thugged out, drinking, smoking their weed," he says. "But they never messed with us. So I never had a problem with nobody here."Barbee was a 21-year-old limo driver and part-time tennis coach when Richard Williams invited him to train with his daughters."Tennis was a passion," he says.Barbee was a tennis prodigy himself, so when he faced Venus and Serena on the court, he had finally met his match."Man, it was unbelievable," Barbee says. "Never seen nobody that good. It was something I'd never seen before in my life."Venus wasn't even a teenager yet.Training meant hitting hundreds of balls with enough force to break the strings on their racquets."Every other day, I was restringing my racquets," he says. "My shoes, once a week. A hole right in my foot of my shoe. Used to tape them up."They'd run drills up and down the court, honing their power at the baseline.Enlarge this imageAndre Barbee met Venus and Serena Williams on the tennis courts at East Rancho Dominguez Park in Compton.

On Friday, she advanced to the fourth round of the U.S. Open when she beat 18-year-old Belinda Bencic.Playing in Compton is a distant memory now: The Williams family moved to Florida in 1991. But this is where Venus and Serena learned the game's fundamentals."I love them like my little sisters," says Barbee. "And Richard Williams, I loved him like a father. He was like a dad, you know? I miss training with them. At the time, I didn't have a high school diploma. And [Richard] told me, 'Promise me that you get your high school diploma.'"Richard? I kept my promise," he says. "I have my high school diploma."Barbee doesn't play much tennis these days. But on this court, I can see him reliving that year he spent training with Venus and Serena Williams.And for the record, the last time he played Serena, they never finished their match."She didn't beat me yet," Barbee says. "So Serena, if you're hearing this, you still owe me a match. I can still play. It's just, I can't play long. I can play a set.

We’re in my car, and she’s holding my phone, using an interactive educational app she likes. This robot voice asks her a question: What do you want to be when you grow up? She doesn’t know I’m listening, but I can hear the answer she whispers into the phone. She says, “I want to be a big sister.”STANDING TALLSergio Hudson dress. Fernando Jorge earring.Fashion Editor: Gabriella Karefa-Johnson.Olympia says this a lot, even when she knows I’m listening. Sometimes before bed, she prays to Jehovah to bring her a baby sister. (She doesn’t want anything to do with a boy!) I’m the youngest of five sisters myself, and my sisters are my heroes, so this has felt like a moment I need to listen very carefully to.Believe me, I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don’t think it’s fair. If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family. Maybe I’d be more of a Tom Brady if I had that opportunity. Don’t get me wrong: I love being a woman, and I loved every second of being pregnant with Olympia. I was one of those annoying women who adored being pregnant and was working until the day I had to report to the hospital—although things got super complicated on the other side. And I almost did do the impossible: A lot of people don’t realize that I was two months pregnant when I won the Australian Open in 2017. But I’m turning 41 this month, and something’s got to give.I’ve been reluctant to admit that I have to move on from playing tennis. It’s like a taboo topic. It comes up, and I start to cry. I think the only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapistI have never liked the wordretirement.It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me. I’ve been thinking of this as a transition, but I want to be sensitive about how I use that word, which means something very specific and important to a community of people. Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to isevolution.I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me. A few years ago I quietly started Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm. Soon after that, I started a family. I want to grow that family.But I’ve been reluctant to admit to myself or anyone else that I have to move on from playing tennis. Alexis, my husband, and I have hardly talked about it; it’s like a taboo topic. I can’t even have this conversation with my mom and dad. It’s like it’s not real until you say it out loud. It comes up, I get an uncomfortable lump in my throat, and I start to cry. The only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapist! One thing I’m not going to do is sugarcoat this. I know that a lot of people are excited about and look forward to retiring, and I really wish I felt that way. Ashleigh Barty was number one in the world when she left the sport this March, and I believe she really felt ready to move on. Caroline Wozniacki, who is one of my best friends, felt a sense of relief when she retired in 2020.LIVING LEGENDSPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz with sister Venus Williams inVogue, May 1998.Praise to these people, but I’m going to be honest. There is no happiness in this topic for me. I know it’s not the usual thing to say, but I feel a great deal of pain. It’s the hardest thing that I could ever imagine. I hate it. I hate that I have to be at this crossroads. I keep saying to myself, I wish it could be easy for me, but it’s not. I’m torn: I don’t want it to be over, but at the same time I’m ready for what’s next. I don’t know how I’m going to be able to look at this magazine when it comes out, knowing that this is it, the end of a story that started in Compton, California, with a little Black girl who just wanted to play tennis. This sport has given me so much. I love to win. I love the battle. I love to entertain. I’m not sure every player sees it that way, but I love the performance aspect of it—to be able to entertain people week after week. Some of the happiest times in my life were spent waiting in that hallway in Melbourne, and walking out into Rod Laver Arena with my earphones in and trying to stay focused and drown out the noise but still feeling the energy of the crowd. Night matches in Arthur Ashe Stadium at Flushing Meadows. Hitting an ace on set point.My whole life, up to now, has been tennis. My dad says I first picked up a racket when I was three, but I think it was even earlier. There’s a picture of Venus pushing me in a stroller on a tennis court, and I couldn’t have been more than 18 months. Unlike Venus, who’s always been stoic and classy, I’ve never been one to contain my emotions. I remember learning to write my alphabet for kindergarten and not doing it perfectly and crying all night. I was so angry about it. I’d erase and rewrite thatAover and over, and my mother let me stay up all night while my sisters were in bed. That’s always been me. I want to be great. I want to be perfect. I know perfect doesn’t exist, but whatever my perfect was, I never wanted to stop until I got it right.To me that’s kind of the essence of being Serena: expecting the best from myself and proving people wrong. There were so many matches I won because something made me angry or someone counted me out. That drove me. I’ve built a career on channeling anger and negativity and turning it into something good. My sister Venus once said that when someone out there says you can’t do something, it is because they can’t do it. But I did do it. And so can you.POWER PLAYERPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz inVogue, April 2003.If you watchedKing Richard,then you know that when I was little, I was not very good at tennis. I was so sad when I didn’t get all the early opportunities that Venus got, but that helped me. It made me work harder, turning me into a savage fighter. I’d travel to tournaments with Venus as her hitting partner, and if there was an open slot, I’d play. I followed her around the world and watched her. When she lost, I understood why, and I made sure I wouldn’t lose the same way. That’s how I started to move so fast up the rankings, because I learned the lessons from Venus’s losses instead of the hard way, from my own. It was as if I were playing her matches, too. I’m a good mimic. Growing up I tried to copy Pete Sampras. I loved Monica Seles, and then I studied Monica Seles. I watched, I listened, then I attacked. But if I hadn’t been in Venus’s shadow, I would never be who I am. When someone said I was just the little sister, that’s when I got really fired up.I started playing tennis with the goal of winning the U.S. Open. I didn’t think past that. And then I just kept winning. I remember when I passed Martina Hingis’s grand slam count. Then Seles’s. And then I tied Billie Jean King, who is such an inspiration for me because of how she has pioneered gender equality in all sports. Then it was climbing over the Chris Evert–Martina Navratilova mountain. There are people who say I’m not the GOAT because I didn’t pass Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam titles, which she achieved before the “open era” that began in 1968. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want that record. Obviously I do. But day to day, I’m really not thinking about her. If I’m in a grand slam final, then yes, I am thinking about that record. Maybe I thought about it too much, and that didn’t help. The way I see it, I should have had 30-plus grand slams. I had my chances after coming back from giving birth. I went from a C-section to a second pulmonary embolism to a grand slam final. I played while breastfeeding. I played through postpartum depression. But I didn’t get there. Shoulda, woulda, coulda. I didn’t show up the way I should have or could have. But I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine. Actually it’s extraordinary. But these days, if I have to choose between building my tennis résumé and building my family, I choose the latter.QUEEN OF THE COURTPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz inVogue, April 2015.Earlier in my career, I never thought about having kids. There were times when I’ve wondered if I should ever bring kids into this world, with all its problems. I was never that confident or comfortable around babies or children, and I figured that if I ever did have a baby, I would have people taking care of it 24/7. I’m not going to lie—I definitely have a lot of support. But I’m also an incredibly hands-on mother. My husband will tell you I am too hands-on. In five years, Olympia has only spent one 24-hour period away from me. This past year, while I was recovering from a hamstring injury, I got to pick her up from school four or five days a week, and I always looked forward to seeing her face light up when she walked out of the building and saw me waiting there for her. The fact is that nothing is a sacrifice for me when it comes to Olympia. It all just makes sense. I want to teach her how to tie her shoes, how to read, where babies come from, and about God. Just like my mom taught me. As she grows, it’s something different every month. Lately she’s been into watching baking shows, which we do together. Now we bake with Play-Doh, which is so much fun. She loves this game called The Floor Is Lava, where you have to do whatever you can to avoid touching the ground. I love setting up my gym for the game, arranging my step-up boxes and weight machines like an obstacle course. Whatever she likes, I like.AT EASE“I want to be great. I want to be perfect.

Nothing is a sacrifice when it comes to Olympia. It all just makes sense.” Danielle Frankel gown.I think tennis, by comparison, has always felt like a sacrifice—though it’s one I enjoyed making. When you’re younger, you see kids having fun, and you want to do that stuff but you know you have to be on the court, hoping that one day it will all pay off. I got pushed hard by my parents. Nowadays so many parents say, “Let your kids do what they want!” Well, that’s not what got me where I am. I didn’t rebel as a kid. I worked hard, and I followed the rules. I do want to push Olympia—not in tennis, but in whatever captures her interest. But I don’t want to push too hard. I’m still trying to figure out that balance.In my own life, the balance has been slowly shifting toward Serena Ventures. I always say that I’m a sponge: At night I go to bed and I squeeze myself out so that the next day I can take up as much new information as I can. Every morning, I’m so excited to walk downstairs to my office and jump onto Zooms and start reviewing decks of companies we’re considering investing in. We’re a small but growing firm of six people scattered between Florida, where I mainly live, Texas, and California. I started investing nine years ago, and I really fell in love with early stage, whether it’s pre-seed funding, where you’re investing in just an idea, or seed, where the idea has already been turned into a product. I wrote one of the very first checks for MasterClass. It’s one of 16 unicorns—companies valued at more than $1 billion—that Serena Ventures has funded, along with Tonal, Impossible Foods, Noom, and Esusu, to name a few. This year we raised $111 million of outside financing, from banks, private individuals, and family offices. Seventy-​eight percent of our portfolio happens to be companies started by women and people of color, because that’s who we are. On the other hand, my husband is white, and it’s important to me to be inclusive of everyone. Serena Ventures has been an all-female business until recently, when we brought in our first guy—a diversity hire!FEELING GRAND“I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine. Actually it’s extraordinary.” Wales Bonner dress. Lagos chain necklace. Dezso by Sara Beltran pendant.A few years ago, I was at a conference organized by JPMorgan Chase, where I watched a talk between Jamie Dimon and Caryn Seidman-Becker, the CEO of the security company Clear. Caryn explained that less than 2 percent of all VC money went to women. I figured that she misspoke. I thought, There’s no way that 98 percent of that capital is going to men. I approached her afterward, and she confirmed it. I kind of understood then and there that someone who looks like me needs to start writing the big checks. Sometimes like attracts like. Men are writing those big checks to one another, and in order for us to change that, more people who look like me need to be in that position, giving money back to themselves. I’m so grateful to women like Caryn, as well as Sheryl Sandberg and others who have mentored me. It’s important to have women like that who believe in you and push you to think bigger and do bigger.I’d like to think that thanks to me, women athletes can be themselves. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it allIn the last year, Alexis and I have been trying to have another child, and we recently got some information from my doctor that put my mind at ease and made me feel that whenever we’re ready, we can add to our family. I definitely don’t want to be pregnant again as an athlete. I need to be two feet into tennis or two feet out.This spring, I had the itch to get back on the court for the first time in seven months. I was talking to Tiger Woods, who’s a friend, and I told him I needed his advice on my tennis career. I said, “I don’t know what to do: I think I’m over it, but maybe I’m not over it.” He’s Tiger, and he was adamant that I be a beast the same way he is! He said, “Serena, what if you just gave it two weeks? You don’t have to commit to anything. You just go out on the court every day for two weeks and give it your all and see what happens.” I said, “All right, I think I can do that.” And I didn’t do it. But a month later, I gave it a try. And it felt magical to pick up a racket again. And I was good. I was really good. I went back and forth about whether to play Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open after that. As I’ve said, this whole evolution thing has not been easy for me.I don’t particularly like to think about my legacy. I get asked about it a lot, and I never know exactly what to say. But I’d like to think that thanks to opportunities afforded to me, women athletes feel that they can be themselves on the court. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can be strong yet beautiful. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it all. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career. Mistakes are learning experiences, and I embrace those moments. I’m far from perfect, but I’ve also taken a lot of criticism, and I’d like to think that I went through some hard times as a professional tennis player so that the next generation could have it easier. Over the years, I hope that people come to think of me as symbolizing something bigger than tennis. I admire Billie Jean because she transcended her sport. I’d like it to be: Serena is this and she’s thatandshe was a great tennis playerandshe won those slams.Unfortunately I wasn’t ready to win Wimbledon this year. And I don’t know if I will be ready to win New York. But I’m going to try. And the lead-up tournaments will be fun. I know there’s a fan fantasy that I might have tied Margaret that day in London, then maybe beat her record in New York, and then at the trophy ceremony say, “See ya!” I get that. It’s a good fantasy. But I’m not looking for some ceremonial, final on-court moment. I’m terrible at goodbyes, the world’s worst. But please know that I am more grateful for you than I can ever express in words. You have carried me to so many wins and so many trophies. I’m going to miss that version of me, that girl who played tennis. And I’m going to miss you.HAPPY DAYSGucci Exquisite MTO gown.

It’s just two months after the tennis titans went toe to toe at the Top Seed Open in Kentucky, which was their first time back on the court since the forced hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The world-famous pair, who have played many roles in each other’s lives in the 23 years since their first match against each other—best friends, former teammates, competitors, and longtime roommates—are giggling as they reflect on the five-year journey of collaborating on their greatest joint effort yet: designing Serena’s dream home.After co-owning a Palm Beach Gardens property where the Grand Slam duo lived together on and off since 1998, with Serena splitting her time between secondary homes from Bel-Air to Paris, she purchased a sprawling waterfront property of her own, with breathtaking views in a coveted enclave north of Miami, just minutes away from Venus and their parents. To help make the house ideal for her own family, naturally she turned to V Starr, Venus’s world-class design firm.A grouping of pendant lamps byTom Dixon(brass) andSimon Legald for Normann Copenhagen(Glass) sets the tone in the dining room.

Wall covering byPhillip Jeffries; custom Banquette and Fama chairs in aBrentanovelvet.Lelanie Foster“I was moving away from Venus for the first time in my life, so I wanted it to be really meaningful,” Serena says. While mixing family with business can be risky, the secret to their success as siblings and creative collaborators is simple: “You have to know your lane. I’m really good at playing tennis; I’m not as good at interiors. But I was able to learn through just watching Venus.”As with any other client, Venus says, her priority was catering to Serena’s vision—which did a complete 180 during the design process. After she purchased the 14,500-square-foot Spanish Mediterranean–style home, Serena’s traditional tastes suddenly felt out of step with this new phase of life. She credits her love of modern art and technology for ushering in a more modern, minimalist aesthetic. Then, of course, there was the burgeoning romance with tech tycoon Alexis Ohanian. The high-profile couple had only recently begun dating just after Serena embarked upon this massive real estate project, but Sonya Haffey, principal of V Starr, says Serena’s future family goals were an integral part of the design plans all along.Last July—after three years, including a gut renovation—Serena finally moved into the completely reimagined, ultra-modern, intracoastal property with a husband and toddler in tow. As the old adage goes, “If you build it, they will come.” Though, they all maintain, it was mostly Serena’s singular imagination—with guidance from V Starr—that spearheaded the design.RHpendant lights hang above a trapezoidal table.Officine Gulloappliances; Brizo sink fittings;Caesarstonecountertop.Lelanie FosterAVictoria + Alberttub stands in the bath.Brizotub and Shower fittings.

That would’ve been kind of creepy,” Venus chimes in.While Ohanian played the easygoing, supporting role to Serena’s more hands-on approach, one space the doting dad took the lead on perfecting was their three-year-old daughter’s bedroom. Both parents agree the pièce de résistance of their entire home is Olympia’s pink custom-designed castle bed complete with a built-in slide and an equally spectacular, one-of-a-kind chandelier created by blown-glass artist Josh Fradis. Indeed, it is positively fit for a princess.“She goes down the slide every night while we’re thinking, Man, we shouldn’t have done that, because now at bedtime, she just wants to slide,” Serena admits. “But whatever makes her happy makes me happy.”While Olympia’s room is decidedly the most extravagant space in the house, Serena insisted on exercising a bit more restraint in other areas. The marriage of sleek, clean lines and high-end features with warm woods and casual touches that complement Serena’s laid-back vibe resulted in a cohesive visual narrative that embodies Serena’s newly evolved design aesthetic, which Haffey calls “livable luxury,” adding that the client was a well of creativity, serving up references from hotels she’s stayed at all over the world.Art on display in the gallery includes works by (from left) Leonardo drew, Radcliffe Bailey, and David Kracov, as well as a Kaws x Campana chair, a live-edge wood bench, a piece from the Konyak Naga tribe of India, and a Vintage Wurlitzer piano. Floors are wide plank European Oak byHakwood.Lelanie Foster“Serena is not formal,” Venus notes. “She’s fun-loving; she’s very free, and not someone who wants to sit in a chair and serve someone tea. So it had to be a very welcoming space.”At Serena’s request, the V Starr team came up with an out-of-the-box design solution to refashion what was once a classical Floridian-style foyer and formal sitting room with beautiful chairs no one sat in, into a colorful art space with eccentric pieces on display. “When you walk in, it’s like walking into an art gallery,” says Serena. “That’s my favorite part of the house. It’s so unique. I’ve never seen anything like it.”Venus adds: “I am not a fan of just having spaces to have them. Maybe some people use their formal living rooms, but we don’t. So we created a space that she can actually use and enjoy and live with the art, and invite other people to absorb it and have that emotional connection as soon as you walk in. It sets the tone for the rest of the home.”Williams, poolside in Gucci and Serena Williams jewelry. The terrace is clad in White Falda porcelain tile. Landscape design by Lucido & Assoc.

Among the many standout features of the home are heated floors in the bathrooms, a sauna in the gym, a wine cellar the size of a small NYC apartment, an expansive terrace offering indoor/outdoor living spaces that overlooks an infinity pool complete with submerged chaise longues, Serena’s 620-square-foot closet fashioned after a luxe retail space, and a private trophy room to house the superstar athlete’s many awards. But there is one amenity that’s noticeably absent: a tennis court.“I wanted to separate home from work,” Serena says. “I love being home. When you have our job, you never get time to relax. So it’s good for me to be able to sit still and not do anything.”Moving into your dream home during a global pandemic no doubt has its challenges, but for this jet-setting athlete and mogul, being unexpectedly homebound for months has offered a welcome reprieve. The perks include ample quality time nesting with her young family, and a chance to hone her cooking chops. To that end, nailing the kitchen design was of supreme importance to Serena, who is the self-proclaimed cook of the family. The remit: “Somewhere in-between ‘super impressive’ and ‘Come in and grab something out of the fridge,’  ” Venus shares. “So we had to find that balance within the design.” Devised in consultation with Serena’s private chef, it was outfitted by V Starr with the finest appliances, including Gaggenau wall ovens, an Officine Gullo cooktop, and customized gold and black marble backsplash in a diamond-pattern mosaic that over-delivers in wow factor.1/ 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Lelanie Foster; Styling: Mieke ten HaveA guest room is painted inBenjamin Moore’s River Blue. Furniture fromWest Elm.Tennis, tech, and fashion empire-building aside, one of Serena’s favorite Williams family pastimes is karaoke. After winning the U.S. Open, the world champions would celebrate in a private karaoke room on 50th Street in Manhattan. Naturally, Serena had to have one of her own. So, just off the gallery, behind a secret doorway disguised as a bookshelf, lies a karaoke room. This unusual amenity features a small stage, a plush aquamarine velvet banquette, and foliage framing a neon sign that spells sérénade, a playful tribute to Serena’s karaoke persona.Of course, she and her sister even sing karaoke like it’s a competitive sport. House rules? No “Bohemian Rhapsody.” No “Love Shack.” No “I Will Survive.” No “Don’t Stop Believin’.” According to Serena and Venus, this room is reserved for “serious karaoke singers only.”“We all like to have a really good time,” Venus declares. “Our friends all have this very same attitude of loving great design, but not taking themselves too seriously.”Read MoreCelebrity Style14 Dazzling Celebrity Bedrooms for the Ultimate InspirationA bedroom is an extremely intimate reflection of a person’s tastes, wants, and needs—and celebrity bedrooms are no exceptionByRachel DaviesArchitecture + DesignTour a SoHo Penthouse That Blends Italian, Japanese, and American Design Sensibilities TogetherStudio Razavi created a generous, sunlight-filled triplex with a palette of rich materials and custom piecesByAnouk SarfatiAD Pro31 of the Brightest and Best Kitchens inADBecause we adore spending time in our kitchens tooByMadeleine LuckelAD-it-Yourself7 Creative Stone Slab Ideas That Go Beyond CountertopsGenius uses that will rock your interiorsByCaitlin Raux GuntherOur website, archdigest.com, offers constant original coverage of the interior design and architecture worlds, new shops and products, travel destinations, art and cultural events, celebrity style, and high-end real estate as well as access to print features and images from the AD archives.FacebookTwitterPinterestInstagramYouTubeTiktokSubscriptionsSubscribeCustomer ServiceRenew SubscriptionGive a GiftChange AddressConnect with ADAbout ADContact the EditorsNewsletter Sign UpContact AdvertisingMembership FAQsGeneral FAQsCondé Nast StoreCareersAccessibility HelpAD ReviewsCondé Nast SpotlightDo Not Sell My Personal Info©2023Condé Nast.

The family included her parents—Oracene Price, a nurse, and Richard Williams, who founded a security service—andVenus Williams, her older sister. Price also had three daughters from a previous marriage. While both parents encouraged Serena and Venus Williams to play tennis, it was Richard Williams who largely taught them the sport, taking the two girls to the public courts in the area. He was known as a strict coach, and the sisters spent long hours practicing. In 1991 the family moved to Florida so that Serena and Venus Williams couldattenda tennis academy. Serena Williams turned professional in 1995, one year after her older sister. Possessing powerful serves and ground strokes and superb athleticism, they soon attracted much attention. Many predicted that Venus would be the first Williams sister to win a Grand Slam singles title, but it was Serena who accomplished the feat, winning the 1999 U.S. Open. At that tournament the sisters won the doubles event, and, over the course of their careers, the two teamed up for 14 Grand Slam doubles titles.Britannica QuizSports: Fact or Fiction?Serena Williams and Venus WilliamsSerena WilliamsAt the2000 Olympic Gamesin Sydney,Australia, Serena and Venus Williams won gold medals in the doubles event. After several years of inconsistent play, Serena Williamsassertedherself in 2002 and won theFrench Open,Wimbledon, and theU.S. Open, defeating Venus Williams in the finals of each tournament. At the latter tournament, Serena Williams also garnered attention by wearing a catsuit. Long interested in fashion, Williams became noted for bold outfits that highlighted her strength and challenged traditional—and typically conservative—dress codes. Displaying her trademark tenacity, Williams won theAustralian Openin 2003 and thus completed a career Grand Slam by having won all four of the slam’s component tournaments. Later that year she was also victorious at Wimbledon; both of her Grand Slam wins in 2003 came after she had bested her sister in the finals. In 2005 Williams won the Australian Open again. Beset by injury the following year, she rebounded in 2007 to win her third Australian Open. Serena and Venus Williams won their second doubles tennis gold medal at the2008 Olympic Gamesin Beijing. Later that year Serena Williams won the U.S. Open for a third time. In 2009 she captured her 10th Grand Slam singles title by winning the Australian Open. Later that year she won her third Wimbledon singles title, once again defeating her sister. Williams defended her titles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2010. She subsequently battled various health issues that kept her off the court for almost a year.Serena WilliamsIn 2012 Williams captured her fifth Wimbledon singles title. A month later at theLondon Olympic Games, she won a gold medal in the singles event, becoming the second woman (behindSteffi Graf) to win a career Golden Slam. She also teamed with her sister to win the doubles event. Later that year Williams claimed her 15th Grand Slam singles title with a victory at the U.S. Open. In 2013 she won her second French Open singles championship and fifth U.S. Open singles title. Williams successfully defended her U.S. Open championship in 2014, which gave her 18 career Grand Slam titles, tying her withChris EvertandMartina Navratilovafor the second highest women’s singles total of the open era. The following year she captured her sixth Australian Open. Williams then won the 2015 French Open—her 20th total Grand Slam singles championship. She continued hertorridstreak at Wimbledon, winning a straight-set final to capture her sixth career Wimbledon singles title. Williams again won Wimbledon in 2016, giving her 22 career Grand Slam singles titles, which tied her with Graf for the most Slams in the open era for both women and men. Williams broke Graf’s record at the 2017 Australian Open, where she defeated her sister in the final.Serena Williams and her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr.In April 2017, Williams announced that she was pregnant (she had gotten engaged to Alexis Ohanian, cofounder of the website Reddit, in December 2016) and would miss the remainder of the 2017 season. In September she gave birth to a daughter, and two months later she married Ohanian. Williams returned to tennis in March 2018. She failed to win a tournament that year, though she reached the finals at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. The latter loss proved controversial as Williams was penalized a game after arguing with the chair umpire over a code violation. In 2019 she was again defeated in the finals at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. At the 2020 ASB Classic in Auckland,New Zealand, Williams won her first singles event in some three years.Williams reached the semifinals of the 2021 Australian Open but lost toNaomi Osaka. Later that year she was forced towithdrawfrom both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open because of injuries. After missing the first half of the 2022 season, Williams competed at Wimbledon but was defeated in the first round. She later wasinterviewed forVoguemagazineand revealed that she would be retiring after the upcoming U.S. Open. Williams stated that she was “evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.”Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.Subscribe NowWilliams’s activities outside of tennis include ventures relating to fashion, beauty, and accessories.

We’re in my car, and she’s holding my phone, using an interactive educational app she likes. This robot voice asks her a question: What do you want to be when you grow up? She doesn’t know I’m listening, but I can hear the answer she whispers into the phone. She says, “I want to be a big sister.”STANDING TALLSergio Hudson dress. Fernando Jorge earring.Fashion Editor: Gabriella Karefa-Johnson.Olympia says this a lot, even when she knows I’m listening. Sometimes before bed, she prays to Jehovah to bring her a baby sister. (She doesn’t want anything to do with a boy!) I’m the youngest of five sisters myself, and my sisters are my heroes, so this has felt like a moment I need to listen very carefully to.Believe me, I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don’t think it’s fair. If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family. Maybe I’d be more of a Tom Brady if I had that opportunity. Don’t get me wrong: I love being a woman, and I loved every second of being pregnant with Olympia. I was one of those annoying women who adored being pregnant and was working until the day I had to report to the hospital—although things got super complicated on the other side. And I almost did do the impossible: A lot of people don’t realize that I was two months pregnant when I won the Australian Open in 2017. But I’m turning 41 this month, and something’s got to give.I’ve been reluctant to admit that I have to move on from playing tennis. It’s like a taboo topic. It comes up, and I start to cry. I think the only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapistI have never liked the wordretirement.It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me. I’ve been thinking of this as a transition, but I want to be sensitive about how I use that word, which means something very specific and important to a community of people. Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to isevolution.I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me. A few years ago I quietly started Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm. Soon after that, I started a family. I want to grow that family.But I’ve been reluctant to admit to myself or anyone else that I have to move on from playing tennis. Alexis, my husband, and I have hardly talked about it; it’s like a taboo topic. I can’t even have this conversation with my mom and dad. It’s like it’s not real until you say it out loud. It comes up, I get an uncomfortable lump in my throat, and I start to cry. The only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapist! One thing I’m not going to do is sugarcoat this. I know that a lot of people are excited about and look forward to retiring, and I really wish I felt that way. Ashleigh Barty was number one in the world when she left the sport this March, and I believe she really felt ready to move on. Caroline Wozniacki, who is one of my best friends, felt a sense of relief when she retired in 2020.LIVING LEGENDSPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz with sister Venus Williams inVogue, May 1998.Praise to these people, but I’m going to be honest. There is no happiness in this topic for me. I know it’s not the usual thing to say, but I feel a great deal of pain. It’s the hardest thing that I could ever imagine. I hate it. I hate that I have to be at this crossroads. I keep saying to myself, I wish it could be easy for me, but it’s not. I’m torn: I don’t want it to be over, but at the same time I’m ready for what’s next. I don’t know how I’m going to be able to look at this magazine when it comes out, knowing that this is it, the end of a story that started in Compton, California, with a little Black girl who just wanted to play tennis. This sport has given me so much. I love to win. I love the battle. I love to entertain. I’m not sure every player sees it that way, but I love the performance aspect of it—to be able to entertain people week after week. Some of the happiest times in my life were spent waiting in that hallway in Melbourne, and walking out into Rod Laver Arena with my earphones in and trying to stay focused and drown out the noise but still feeling the energy of the crowd. Night matches in Arthur Ashe Stadium at Flushing Meadows. Hitting an ace on set point.My whole life, up to now, has been tennis. My dad says I first picked up a racket when I was three, but I think it was even earlier. There’s a picture of Venus pushing me in a stroller on a tennis court, and I couldn’t have been more than 18 months. Unlike Venus, who’s always been stoic and classy, I’ve never been one to contain my emotions. I remember learning to write my alphabet for kindergarten and not doing it perfectly and crying all night. I was so angry about it. I’d erase and rewrite thatAover and over, and my mother let me stay up all night while my sisters were in bed. That’s always been me. I want to be great. I want to be perfect. I know perfect doesn’t exist, but whatever my perfect was, I never wanted to stop until I got it right.To me that’s kind of the essence of being Serena: expecting the best from myself and proving people wrong. There were so many matches I won because something made me angry or someone counted me out. That drove me. I’ve built a career on channeling anger and negativity and turning it into something good. My sister Venus once said that when someone out there says you can’t do something, it is because they can’t do it. But I did do it. And so can you.POWER PLAYERPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz inVogue, April 2003.If you watchedKing Richard,then you know that when I was little, I was not very good at tennis. I was so sad when I didn’t get all the early opportunities that Venus got, but that helped me. It made me work harder, turning me into a savage fighter. I’d travel to tournaments with Venus as her hitting partner, and if there was an open slot, I’d play. I followed her around the world and watched her. When she lost, I understood why, and I made sure I wouldn’t lose the same way. That’s how I started to move so fast up the rankings, because I learned the lessons from Venus’s losses instead of the hard way, from my own. It was as if I were playing her matches, too. I’m a good mimic. Growing up I tried to copy Pete Sampras. I loved Monica Seles, and then I studied Monica Seles. I watched, I listened, then I attacked. But if I hadn’t been in Venus’s shadow, I would never be who I am. When someone said I was just the little sister, that’s when I got really fired up.I started playing tennis with the goal of winning the U.S. Open. I didn’t think past that. And then I just kept winning. I remember when I passed Martina Hingis’s grand slam count. Then Seles’s. And then I tied Billie Jean King, who is such an inspiration for me because of how she has pioneered gender equality in all sports. Then it was climbing over the Chris Evert–Martina Navratilova mountain. There are people who say I’m not the GOAT because I didn’t pass Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam titles, which she achieved before the “open era” that began in 1968. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want that record. Obviously I do. But day to day, I’m really not thinking about her. If I’m in a grand slam final, then yes, I am thinking about that record. Maybe I thought about it too much, and that didn’t help. The way I see it, I should have had 30-plus grand slams. I had my chances after coming back from giving birth. I went from a C-section to a second pulmonary embolism to a grand slam final. I played while breastfeeding. I played through postpartum depression. But I didn’t get there. Shoulda, woulda, coulda. I didn’t show up the way I should have or could have. But I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine. Actually it’s extraordinary. But these days, if I have to choose between building my tennis résumé and building my family, I choose the latter.QUEEN OF THE COURTPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz inVogue, April 2015.Earlier in my career, I never thought about having kids. There were times when I’ve wondered if I should ever bring kids into this world, with all its problems. I was never that confident or comfortable around babies or children, and I figured that if I ever did have a baby, I would have people taking care of it 24/7. I’m not going to lie—I definitely have a lot of support. But I’m also an incredibly hands-on mother. My husband will tell you I am too hands-on. In five years, Olympia has only spent one 24-hour period away from me. This past year, while I was recovering from a hamstring injury, I got to pick her up from school four or five days a week, and I always looked forward to seeing her face light up when she walked out of the building and saw me waiting there for her. The fact is that nothing is a sacrifice for me when it comes to Olympia. It all just makes sense. I want to teach her how to tie her shoes, how to read, where babies come from, and about God. Just like my mom taught me. As she grows, it’s something different every month. Lately she’s been into watching baking shows, which we do together. Now we bake with Play-Doh, which is so much fun. She loves this game called The Floor Is Lava, where you have to do whatever you can to avoid touching the ground. I love setting up my gym for the game, arranging my step-up boxes and weight machines like an obstacle course. Whatever she likes, I like.AT EASE“I want to be great. I want to be perfect.

Nothing is a sacrifice when it comes to Olympia. It all just makes sense.” Danielle Frankel gown.I think tennis, by comparison, has always felt like a sacrifice—though it’s one I enjoyed making. When you’re younger, you see kids having fun, and you want to do that stuff but you know you have to be on the court, hoping that one day it will all pay off. I got pushed hard by my parents. Nowadays so many parents say, “Let your kids do what they want!” Well, that’s not what got me where I am. I didn’t rebel as a kid. I worked hard, and I followed the rules. I do want to push Olympia—not in tennis, but in whatever captures her interest. But I don’t want to push too hard. I’m still trying to figure out that balance.In my own life, the balance has been slowly shifting toward Serena Ventures. I always say that I’m a sponge: At night I go to bed and I squeeze myself out so that the next day I can take up as much new information as I can. Every morning, I’m so excited to walk downstairs to my office and jump onto Zooms and start reviewing decks of companies we’re considering investing in. We’re a small but growing firm of six people scattered between Florida, where I mainly live, Texas, and California. I started investing nine years ago, and I really fell in love with early stage, whether it’s pre-seed funding, where you’re investing in just an idea, or seed, where the idea has already been turned into a product. I wrote one of the very first checks for MasterClass. It’s one of 16 unicorns—companies valued at more than $1 billion—that Serena Ventures has funded, along with Tonal, Impossible Foods, Noom, and Esusu, to name a few. This year we raised $111 million of outside financing, from banks, private individuals, and family offices. Seventy-​eight percent of our portfolio happens to be companies started by women and people of color, because that’s who we are. On the other hand, my husband is white, and it’s important to me to be inclusive of everyone. Serena Ventures has been an all-female business until recently, when we brought in our first guy—a diversity hire!FEELING GRAND“I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine. Actually it’s extraordinary.” Wales Bonner dress. Lagos chain necklace. Dezso by Sara Beltran pendant.A few years ago, I was at a conference organized by JPMorgan Chase, where I watched a talk between Jamie Dimon and Caryn Seidman-Becker, the CEO of the security company Clear. Caryn explained that less than 2 percent of all VC money went to women. I figured that she misspoke. I thought, There’s no way that 98 percent of that capital is going to men. I approached her afterward, and she confirmed it. I kind of understood then and there that someone who looks like me needs to start writing the big checks. Sometimes like attracts like. Men are writing those big checks to one another, and in order for us to change that, more people who look like me need to be in that position, giving money back to themselves. I’m so grateful to women like Caryn, as well as Sheryl Sandberg and others who have mentored me. It’s important to have women like that who believe in you and push you to think bigger and do bigger.I’d like to think that thanks to me, women athletes can be themselves. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it allIn the last year, Alexis and I have been trying to have another child, and we recently got some information from my doctor that put my mind at ease and made me feel that whenever we’re ready, we can add to our family. I definitely don’t want to be pregnant again as an athlete. I need to be two feet into tennis or two feet out.This spring, I had the itch to get back on the court for the first time in seven months. I was talking to Tiger Woods, who’s a friend, and I told him I needed his advice on my tennis career. I said, “I don’t know what to do: I think I’m over it, but maybe I’m not over it.” He’s Tiger, and he was adamant that I be a beast the same way he is! He said, “Serena, what if you just gave it two weeks? You don’t have to commit to anything. You just go out on the court every day for two weeks and give it your all and see what happens.” I said, “All right, I think I can do that.” And I didn’t do it. But a month later, I gave it a try. And it felt magical to pick up a racket again. And I was good. I was really good. I went back and forth about whether to play Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open after that. As I’ve said, this whole evolution thing has not been easy for me.I don’t particularly like to think about my legacy. I get asked about it a lot, and I never know exactly what to say. But I’d like to think that thanks to opportunities afforded to me, women athletes feel that they can be themselves on the court. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can be strong yet beautiful. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it all. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career. Mistakes are learning experiences, and I embrace those moments. I’m far from perfect, but I’ve also taken a lot of criticism, and I’d like to think that I went through some hard times as a professional tennis player so that the next generation could have it easier. Over the years, I hope that people come to think of me as symbolizing something bigger than tennis. I admire Billie Jean because she transcended her sport. I’d like it to be: Serena is this and she’s thatandshe was a great tennis playerandshe won those slams.Unfortunately I wasn’t ready to win Wimbledon this year. And I don’t know if I will be ready to win New York. But I’m going to try. And the lead-up tournaments will be fun. I know there’s a fan fantasy that I might have tied Margaret that day in London, then maybe beat her record in New York, and then at the trophy ceremony say, “See ya!” I get that. It’s a good fantasy. But I’m not looking for some ceremonial, final on-court moment. I’m terrible at goodbyes, the world’s worst. But please know that I am more grateful for you than I can ever express in words. You have carried me to so many wins and so many trophies. I’m going to miss that version of me, that girl who played tennis. And I’m going to miss you.HAPPY DAYSGucci Exquisite MTO gown.

It’s just two months after the tennis titans went toe to toe at the Top Seed Open in Kentucky, which was their first time back on the court since the forced hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The world-famous pair, who have played many roles in each other’s lives in the 23 years since their first match against each other—best friends, former teammates, competitors, and longtime roommates—are giggling as they reflect on the five-year journey of collaborating on their greatest joint effort yet: designing Serena’s dream home.After co-owning a Palm Beach Gardens property where the Grand Slam duo lived together on and off since 1998, with Serena splitting her time between secondary homes from Bel-Air to Paris, she purchased a sprawling waterfront property of her own, with breathtaking views in a coveted enclave north of Miami, just minutes away from Venus and their parents. To help make the house ideal for her own family, naturally she turned to V Starr, Venus’s world-class design firm.A grouping of pendant lamps byTom Dixon(brass) andSimon Legald for Normann Copenhagen(Glass) sets the tone in the dining room. Artwork by Serena Williams.Lelanie FosterThe Sérénade Karaoke room features a bespoke neon sign designed by V Starr. Wall covering byPhillip Jeffries; custom Banquette and Fama chairs in aBrentanovelvet.Lelanie Foster“I was moving away from Venus for the first time in my life, so I wanted it to be really meaningful,” Serena says. While mixing family with business can be risky, the secret to their success as siblings and creative collaborators is simple: “You have to know your lane. I’m really good at playing tennis; I’m not as good at interiors. But I was able to learn through just watching Venus.”As with any other client, Venus says, her priority was catering to Serena’s vision—which did a complete 180 during the design process. After she purchased the 14,500-square-foot Spanish Mediterranean–style home, Serena’s traditional tastes suddenly felt out of step with this new phase of life. She credits her love of modern art and technology for ushering in a more modern, minimalist aesthetic. Then, of course, there was the burgeoning romance with tech tycoon Alexis Ohanian. The high-profile couple had only recently begun dating just after Serena embarked upon this massive real estate project, but Sonya Haffey, principal of V Starr, says Serena’s future family goals were an integral part of the design plans all along.Last July—after three years, including a gut renovation—Serena finally moved into the completely reimagined, ultra-modern, intracoastal property with a husband and toddler in tow. As the old adage goes, “If you build it, they will come.” Though, they all maintain, it was mostly Serena’s singular imagination—with guidance from V Starr—that spearheaded the design.RHpendant lights hang above a trapezoidal table.Officine Gulloappliances; Brizo sink fittings;Caesarstonecountertop.Lelanie FosterAVictoria + Alberttub stands in the bath.Brizotub and Shower fittings.

That would’ve been kind of creepy,” Venus chimes in.While Ohanian played the easygoing, supporting role to Serena’s more hands-on approach, one space the doting dad took the lead on perfecting was their three-year-old daughter’s bedroom. Both parents agree the pièce de résistance of their entire home is Olympia’s pink custom-designed castle bed complete with a built-in slide and an equally spectacular, one-of-a-kind chandelier created by blown-glass artist Josh Fradis. Indeed, it is positively fit for a princess.“She goes down the slide every night while we’re thinking, Man, we shouldn’t have done that, because now at bedtime, she just wants to slide,” Serena admits. “But whatever makes her happy makes me happy.”While Olympia’s room is decidedly the most extravagant space in the house, Serena insisted on exercising a bit more restraint in other areas. The marriage of sleek, clean lines and high-end features with warm woods and casual touches that complement Serena’s laid-back vibe resulted in a cohesive visual narrative that embodies Serena’s newly evolved design aesthetic, which Haffey calls “livable luxury,” adding that the client was a well of creativity, serving up references from hotels she’s stayed at all over the world.Art on display in the gallery includes works by (from left) Leonardo drew, Radcliffe Bailey, and David Kracov, as well as a Kaws x Campana chair, a live-edge wood bench, a piece from the Konyak Naga tribe of India, and a Vintage Wurlitzer piano. Floors are wide plank European Oak byHakwood.Lelanie Foster“Serena is not formal,” Venus notes. “She’s fun-loving; she’s very free, and not someone who wants to sit in a chair and serve someone tea. So it had to be a very welcoming space.”At Serena’s request, the V Starr team came up with an out-of-the-box design solution to refashion what was once a classical Floridian-style foyer and formal sitting room with beautiful chairs no one sat in, into a colorful art space with eccentric pieces on display. “When you walk in, it’s like walking into an art gallery,” says Serena. “That’s my favorite part of the house. It’s so unique. I’ve never seen anything like it.”Venus adds: “I am not a fan of just having spaces to have them. Maybe some people use their formal living rooms, but we don’t. So we created a space that she can actually use and enjoy and live with the art, and invite other people to absorb it and have that emotional connection as soon as you walk in. It sets the tone for the rest of the home.”Williams, poolside in Gucci and Serena Williams jewelry. The terrace is clad in White Falda porcelain tile. Landscape design by Lucido & Assoc.

Among the many standout features of the home are heated floors in the bathrooms, a sauna in the gym, a wine cellar the size of a small NYC apartment, an expansive terrace offering indoor/outdoor living spaces that overlooks an infinity pool complete with submerged chaise longues, Serena’s 620-square-foot closet fashioned after a luxe retail space, and a private trophy room to house the superstar athlete’s many awards. But there is one amenity that’s noticeably absent: a tennis court.“I wanted to separate home from work,” Serena says. “I love being home. When you have our job, you never get time to relax. So it’s good for me to be able to sit still and not do anything.”Moving into your dream home during a global pandemic no doubt has its challenges, but for this jet-setting athlete and mogul, being unexpectedly homebound for months has offered a welcome reprieve. The perks include ample quality time nesting with her young family, and a chance to hone her cooking chops. To that end, nailing the kitchen design was of supreme importance to Serena, who is the self-proclaimed cook of the family. The remit: “Somewhere in-between ‘super impressive’ and ‘Come in and grab something out of the fridge,’  ” Venus shares. “So we had to find that balance within the design.” Devised in consultation with Serena’s private chef, it was outfitted by V Starr with the finest appliances, including Gaggenau wall ovens, an Officine Gullo cooktop, and customized gold and black marble backsplash in a diamond-pattern mosaic that over-delivers in wow factor.1/ 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Lelanie Foster; Styling: Mieke ten HaveA guest room is painted inBenjamin Moore’s River Blue. Furniture fromWest Elm.Tennis, tech, and fashion empire-building aside, one of Serena’s favorite Williams family pastimes is karaoke. After winning the U.S. Open, the world champions would celebrate in a private karaoke room on 50th Street in Manhattan. Naturally, Serena had to have one of her own. So, just off the gallery, behind a secret doorway disguised as a bookshelf, lies a karaoke room. This unusual amenity features a small stage, a plush aquamarine velvet banquette, and foliage framing a neon sign that spells sérénade, a playful tribute to Serena’s karaoke persona.Of course, she and her sister even sing karaoke like it’s a competitive sport. House rules? No “Bohemian Rhapsody.” No “Love Shack.” No “I Will Survive.” No “Don’t Stop Believin’.” According to Serena and Venus, this room is reserved for “serious karaoke singers only.”“We all like to have a really good time,” Venus declares. “Our friends all have this very same attitude of loving great design, but not taking themselves too seriously.”Read MoreCelebrity Style14 Dazzling Celebrity Bedrooms for the Ultimate InspirationA bedroom is an extremely intimate reflection of a person’s tastes, wants, and needs—and celebrity bedrooms are no exceptionByRachel DaviesArchitecture + DesignTour a SoHo Penthouse That Blends Italian, Japanese, and American Design Sensibilities TogetherStudio Razavi created a generous, sunlight-filled triplex with a palette of rich materials and custom piecesByAnouk SarfatiAD Pro31 of the Brightest and Best Kitchens inADBecause we adore spending time in our kitchens tooByMadeleine LuckelAD-it-Yourself7 Creative Stone Slab Ideas That Go Beyond CountertopsGenius uses that will rock your interiorsByCaitlin Raux GuntherOur website, archdigest.com, offers constant original coverage of the interior design and architecture worlds, new shops and products, travel destinations, art and cultural events, celebrity style, and high-end real estate as well as access to print features and images from the AD archives.FacebookTwitterPinterestInstagramYouTubeTiktokSubscriptionsSubscribeCustomer ServiceRenew SubscriptionGive a GiftChange AddressConnect with ADAbout ADContact the EditorsNewsletter Sign UpContact AdvertisingMembership FAQsGeneral FAQsCondé Nast StoreCareersAccessibility HelpAD ReviewsCondé Nast SpotlightDo Not Sell My Personal Info©2023Condé Nast.

The family included her parents—Oracene Price, a nurse, and Richard Williams, who founded a security service—andVenus Williams, her older sister. Price also had three daughters from a previous marriage. While both parents encouraged Serena and Venus Williams to play tennis, it was Richard Williams who largely taught them the sport, taking the two girls to the public courts in the area. He was known as a strict coach, and the sisters spent long hours practicing. In 1991 the family moved to Florida so that Serena and Venus Williams couldattenda tennis academy. Serena Williams turned professional in 1995, one year after her older sister. Possessing powerful serves and ground strokes and superb athleticism, they soon attracted much attention. Many predicted that Venus would be the first Williams sister to win a Grand Slam singles title, but it was Serena who accomplished the feat, winning the 1999 U.S. Open. At that tournament the sisters won the doubles event, and, over the course of their careers, the two teamed up for 14 Grand Slam doubles titles.Britannica QuizGame, Set, Tennis! QuizSerena Williams and Venus WilliamsSerena WilliamsAt the2000 Olympic Gamesin Sydney,Australia, Serena and Venus Williams won gold medals in the doubles event. After several years of inconsistent play, Serena Williamsassertedherself in 2002 and won theFrench Open,Wimbledon, and theU.S. Open, defeating Venus Williams in the finals of each tournament. At the latter tournament, Serena Williams also garnered attention by wearing a catsuit. Long interested in fashion, Williams became noted for bold outfits that highlighted her strength and challenged traditional—and typically conservative—dress codes. Displaying her trademark tenacity, Williams won theAustralian Openin 2003 and thus completed a career Grand Slam by having won all four of the slam’s component tournaments. Later that year she was also victorious at Wimbledon; both of her Grand Slam wins in 2003 came after she had bested her sister in the finals. In 2005 Williams won the Australian Open again. Beset by injury the following year, she rebounded in 2007 to win her third Australian Open. Serena and Venus Williams won their second doubles tennis gold medal at the2008 Olympic Gamesin Beijing. Later that year Serena Williams won the U.S. Open for a third time. In 2009 she captured her 10th Grand Slam singles title by winning the Australian Open. Later that year she won her third Wimbledon singles title, once again defeating her sister. Williams defended her titles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2010. She subsequently battled various health issues that kept her off the court for almost a year.Serena WilliamsIn 2012 Williams captured her fifth Wimbledon singles title. A month later at theLondon Olympic Games, she won a gold medal in the singles event, becoming the second woman (behindSteffi Graf) to win a career Golden Slam. She also teamed with her sister to win the doubles event. Later that year Williams claimed her 15th Grand Slam singles title with a victory at the U.S. Open. In 2013 she won her second French Open singles championship and fifth U.S. Open singles title. Williams successfully defended her U.S. Open championship in 2014, which gave her 18 career Grand Slam titles, tying her withChris EvertandMartina Navratilovafor the second highest women’s singles total of the open era. The following year she captured her sixth Australian Open. Williams then won the 2015 French Open—her 20th total Grand Slam singles championship. She continued hertorridstreak at Wimbledon, winning a straight-set final to capture her sixth career Wimbledon singles title. Williams again won Wimbledon in 2016, giving her 22 career Grand Slam singles titles, which tied her with Graf for the most Slams in the open era for both women and men. Williams broke Graf’s record at the 2017 Australian Open, where she defeated her sister in the final.Serena Williams and her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr.In April 2017, Williams announced that she was pregnant (she had gotten engaged to Alexis Ohanian, cofounder of the website Reddit, in December 2016) and would miss the remainder of the 2017 season. In September she gave birth to a daughter, and two months later she married Ohanian. Williams returned to tennis in March 2018. She failed to win a tournament that year, though she reached the finals at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. The latter loss proved controversial as Williams was penalized a game after arguing with the chair umpire over a code violation. In 2019 she was again defeated in the finals at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. At the 2020 ASB Classic in Auckland,New Zealand, Williams won her first singles event in some three years.Williams reached the semifinals of the 2021 Australian Open but lost toNaomi Osaka. Later that year she was forced towithdrawfrom both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open because of injuries. After missing the first half of the 2022 season, Williams competed at Wimbledon but was defeated in the first round.

But if she was going to have a meal, it would be a "protein and carb" combo like turkey sausage and baked potato.ShutterstockSource:GlamourWhen Williams is away from the court, she might order a delicious and healthy-looking platter for breakfast including smoothies and fruits.Wonderful breakfast at one of my favorite spots #villard. Thanks! @newyorkpalaceA post shared by  Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) on May 1, 2017 at 6:18am PDTMay 1, 2017 at 6:18am PDTIt's not all clean-eating, though. Williams has an obvious sweet tooth and won't hesitate to put away a beignet, which is basically a deep-fried nugget of sugary dough.A post shared by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams)Nov 28, 2017 at 5:26pm PSTWhen it comes to lunches, or general snacking, Williams never refuses a taco — and they are an ever-present feature of the tennis champion's Instagram.A post shared by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams)Oct 4, 2016 at 5:37am PDTWilliams once said on Facebook: "I want tacos. Everyday I want tacos. I don't know what to do? Is there help for someone that wants to eat tacos everyday?"ShutterstockSource:Facebook.If tacos aren't on the menu and Williams wanted to celebrate a tennis success, she has said she would order a cheese pizza and french fries.ShutterstockSource:GlamourBut sometimes nothing beats home cooking and, for Williams, that means her mother's chicken, rice, and gravy.ShutterstockSource:Bon AppetitIf Williams is doing the cooking, then she likes to wow her friends and family with a number of dishes. "For years I was always making gumbo for everyone," she told Bon Appétit. "My other go-to dishes are something I call a 'seven-bean delight' which really only has five beans, but don't tell. And roasted chicken with garlic."ShutterstockSource:Bon AppetitAside from tacos, there is another food Williams is obsessed with — moon pie. "I love moon pies," she told Bon Appétit. "If 'Moon Pie' sponsored me, I'd be bigger than any house on this planet! I love the originals: banana, chocolate, or vanilla. Now I really want a Moon Pie!"Why oh why am I so in love with you dear Mr. Moon Pie?A post shared by  Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) on Apr 1, 2012 at 8:28pm PDTApr 1, 2012 at 8:28pm PDTSource:Bon AppetitSerena Williams may be retiring from playing pro tennis, but her love for tacos and moon pie will forever live on.Serena Williams.Getty/Robert PrangeRead nextFeaturesTennisSerena WilliamsMore...Close iconTwo crossed lines that form an 'X'.

Local restaurant owner becomes private chef for Serena Williams | Laurie's StoriesNewsIndian RiverMartinSt. LucieSportsPhotos / VideosObitseNewspaperLegalsWHATTODOIN772Former local restaurant owner becomes private chef for Serena Williams | Laurie's StoriesLaurie K. BlandfordTreasure Coast NewspapersEric Grutka didn’t close Ian’s Tropical Grill, one of the best restaurants on the Treasure Coast, to become the private chef for Serena Williams.He had been fueling the world’s greatest tennis player since June 2017 — long before he stopped at the end of May cooking creative dishes in the Stuart restaurant he owned with his wife, Paula, he told me in a recent interview.The reason was two-fold: a growing food scene and Hurricane Irma.“We probably shouldn’t have reopened after the hurricane,” Grutka said. “We were closed, without power for a (week), and that hurt.”His restaurant had survived worse. In 2004, it closed for a month after Hurricane Frances and reopened just five days before it closed again for more than three weeks because of Hurricane Jeanne.After he reopened this time, he started seeing regular customers only once a month instead of two or three times.“More and more restaurants have opened in Martin County, so the competition is different,” Grutka said. “We weren’t really seeing the restaurant being profitable.“We were struggling to kind of keep it going, but I wasn’t ready to give up on it.”Trying to do both jobs became difficult, and he admitted the food was different when he wasn’t at the restaurant.In the end, he just ran out of money. He couldn't open because he couldn't buy groceries.“We had 18 good years,” Grutka said. “It was a great run for sure.”Joining “Team Serena”Grutka, 47, previously did a five-year private chef gig for a family while he ran the restaurant, he said. However, that wasn’t full time like his current job.It all started when a friend from ESPN Radio sent him a message asking if he knew a private chef who could work for Williams.“I was like, I don’t really know anybody,” Grutka said, “but I’ll go cook.”He cooked for a couple days and then waited. A few months later, he got a call with an offer to hire him.Now, he’s basically an on-call chef, waiting at his Jensen Beach home to hear where he’s going next. He doesn’t travel with Williams everywhere; it’s at random.“I have a suitcase always packed and ready,” Grutka said.With his new job as part of “Team Serena,” he’s been able to travel the world. His biggest trip so far has been to the United Kingdom for Wimbledon. He’s also been to San Francisco and Cincinnati.He didn’t go with the tennis champion to New York for the U.S. Open this year because she’s busy with appearances and visiting friends. In cases like that, it’s up to Williams to fend for herself.“It’s convenient and good to have me around,” Grutka said. “If she doesn’t need me, it doesn’t make sense to just have me sitting up there.”In the beginning, he was intimated by Williams. He would overthink cooking, not wanting to mess up.He quickly learned she and her husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, want to be treated like regular people. Grutka’s primary focus is Williams, but he also cooks for Ohanian whenever they’re together.“It’s so far been probably one of the most amazing things I’ve experienced — once I got over the initial shock of being in the same house,” Grutka said.He didn’t want to get specific about what meals he makes for her, but he did send me a few photos as examples: shrimp and vegetable stir fry, roasted halibut with grilled zucchini and pine nut citrus dressing and seared chicken thighs with mango and Meyer lemon salsa and Meyer lemon steamed asparagus.The food is focused on healthy and clean eating using gluten- and dairy-free ingredients. He said it's challenging.“It’s making me use my mind,” Grutka said. “I’m used to cooking fried chicken and all that.”Making three meals a day, he must come up with a variety of dishes, or it would be boring for Williams.That’s quite a different philosophy, catering a menu specifically for someone instead of cooking what you want at your own restaurant.Grutka used to be a big fish in a small pond. Now, he said, he lives in a world where his job is making Williams’s dining dreams come true.“It’s been an interesting ride,” Grutka said.Life-changing opportunityGrutka began a life-changing shift with diet and exercise at the beginning of this year. He realized he was getting burned out working long hours almost every day at the restaurant.Because it had a fun, late night bar, customers enjoyed hanging out with him and having cocktails. He said it was difficult to say no.“I didn’t realize how unhealthy I’d become,” Grutka said. “I’ve lost 30 pounds.”He tries to eat the same food he makes for Williams, but he still cheats. He said he doesn’t deprive himself of pizza and pasta, but now he’s just eating that in moderation. He’s also eating more whole vegetable and fruits.“I’ve said it to Serena and Alexis: not for nothing, but the opportunity you gave me, it possibly saved my life,” Grutka said.Being the best person you can be is what being a part of her team is all about, he said. It’s nothing she’s said to him; it’s just how he feels.He has surrounded himself with the kind of people he didn’t even know he wanted to become.“Being around people who are successful and driven make you want to be better,” Grutka said. “I can’t represent her as who she is and be her chef and walk around 30 pounds overweight. It doesn’t represent her brand properly.”He said he’s come to terms with closing the restaurant, even though he admitted it’s still tough on him.He’s never been one to quit.“It’s funny; I’ve had a restaurant open for 18 years, and I left feeling like I failed somehow,” Grutka said. “I wasn’t able to close the restaurant on my own terms.”I asked him if he felt guilty about closing because of how much customers loved his food. He said only if there are people who never redeemed their gift certificates.“In the situation we were in, I couldn’t run the restaurant anymore,” Grutka said.He’s not necessarily done with running restaurants. Grutka said he has other concepts in mind. One is something more fun and casual than Ian’s — still with a high-quality level of food — but in a smaller space with a counter where customers can interact with the kitchen.Still, that’s all two or three years down the road, depending on where he is with his current job.“I can always try to open another restaurant,” Grutka said. “I can never again get the opportunity to cook for the greatest athlete of all time.“It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”Laurie K.

And after months of being homebound, travelers everywhere are longing to experience the world again—includingtennis star Serena Williams.Life as a pro athlete comes with a regular dose of international travel, and while Williams may still be (safely) on the road for tournaments, she’s looking forward to fully immersing herself in her favorite destinations. To celebrate the launch ofAway’s latest collaboration with the grand-slam champ, we asked Williams to share the top four places she’s dreaming of returning to once travel is back—and what makes each of them irreplaceable in her eyes.For Serena Williams, the work is never done→Miami: The quintessential city for beachgoers, art lovers, all-night partiers, and sports superstars alike. Photo byZarpe 77.1. Miami, FloridaWhat made you fall in love with Miami?Miami has something for everyone. Between the amazing art scene, the food, the culture, and a wide range of sporting events (let’s go, Miami Dolphins!), you can never run out of things to do. It just has such a beautiful vibrance to it. I’ve made so many amazing memories in Miami, and I cannot wait to make many more.What’s your first (or favorite) memory of Miami?TheS by Serena pop-up shops at Art Baselor my bridal shower at1 Hotel South Beach.What restaurants or meals from Miami do you crave most?NOBU. I love Japanese food, and once you have NOBU, there’s no turning back. I’ve been to a lot of different NOBU locations over the years, but the one in Miami is one of my favorites. It’s part of theEden Roc Hotel, and between the food, views, atmosphere, service, and overall glamour, it’s an experience I always look forward to.[Otherwise,] I don’t necessarily have a go-to restaurant because I’d rather explore as much of the city as possible. You can truly go anywhere in Miami and find a fun atmosphere and delicious food and drinks. That’s part of why I love the city. There’s an adventure around every corner.Where to explore Miami’s cutting-edge art scene year-round→Although she currently lives in Florida, Williams is a California girl through and through. Photo byPhotoholgic.2. San Francisco, CaliforniaWhat made you fall in love with San Francisco?To me, San Francisco feels like a small town. It’s beautiful and big, but when you’re there, you feel like a part of the community. I’ve always been attracted to it, and I envision myself settling down there and just being a mom.What’s your first (or favorite) memory of San Francisco?One day I took a trip to Dolores Park, and while I was out exploring the area with [my husband] Alexis, I saw these two random guys playing tennis. I literally dropped everything to play with them, and I had such a blast doing it. I think they were pretty surprised.What restaurants or meals from San Francisco do you crave most?Mission Chinese. I love Asian cuisine, and Mission’s menu is creative and unique while still having the classics that everyone enjoys. Everything I’ve ordered is delicious. Plus, the atmosphere in the restaurant is perfect for a lowkey date night. It has almost a dive-bar feel with a five-star menu. Plus, they deliver, which is always a perk.[I also love] any Mexican food restaurant or donuts from San Francisco. I know those two sound unrelated, but this city has such a great range of options no matter what you are craving.San Francisco’s most beautiful restaurants→Along with being a tennis champion, Williams is also a polyglot: she speaks English, French, and Italian. Photo byIan Kelsall.3. Paris, FranceWhat made you fall in love with Paris?I lived there for a few years. I learned French and had the opportunity to experience the beautiful European culture.What’s your first (or favorite) memory of Paris?Shopping at Rue Saint-Honoré in Paris. Great street with the best boutiques.What restaurants or meals from Paris do you crave most?APICIUS—it’s gorgeous. From the moment you approach the building, the elegance is obvious. It used to be a chateau and was built in1860. You just feel like royalty there, and I love to bring my friends whenever I can.It’s glamorous, the food is delicious, and you feel like you’ve been teleported into a fairy tale whenever you’re there. Cinderella and Belle would definitely hang out there.And coffee. I’m not sure if it’s the actual coffee or just the overall vibe of being at a cute local cafe, but I love it. I could people-watch for hours at Paris cafes, and having a yummy fresh pastry to go along with it makes it even better.The ultimate guide to Paris’s 10th arrondissement→As the city where she met her lifelong partner, Rome will forever have Williams' heart. Photo byKaLisa Veer.4. Rome, ItalyWhat made you fall in love with Rome?How can you not? So much history, so many amazing moments. It’s my favorite place in the world!What’s your first (or favorite) memory of Rome?Meeting my husband, Alexis.What restaurants or meals from Rome do you crave most?L’Isola della Pizza. In my opinion, they have the best pizza in the city!When in Rome, any type of pasta or pizza works (gluten-free, of course)! Even for breakfast! I mean c’mon—when you think Italy, you think pasta and pizza. The fresh ingredients and home-cooked taste are unlike anything you can get in the States. I can’t get enough.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.A new kind oftravel magazineHere Magazine started as the stories and pictures we picked up on

After debuting back in 1995, the American athlete has conquered all before her and remains one of the most important players on the court.Williams is up there withRoger Federer, Rafael Nadal, andNovak Djokovicwith her dominance. A sports person this great also happens to have fine taste in cars. Serena William's car collection has a wide variety of cars ranging from SUVs to luxury saloons, tosports cars.She seems to have a soft spot for British cars as her collection contains not one, but three Brits - that includes a Bentley, an Aston Martin, and even a Mini. And now, withSerena Williams announcing her retirement from tennis, she has a lot of time to enjoy her sweet rides; and even add some new cars to the collection.Updated August 2022: Since Serena Williams is retiring from tennis, she is going to get more time to spend with her beloved cars. We have updated this article with the latest information about her vibrant car collection.With such a haul of trophies to her name, let's take a look at the other bright and shiny things in her life; Serena Williams' car collection.RELATED:Roger Federer's Car Collection Is A Total AceSerena Owns A Lincoln NavigatorWilliams became a brand ambassador for the Lincoln Navigator in 2018, which has seen the tennis star behind the wheel of the luxury SUV. Aligning herself with the Navigator was actually a blast from the past for Williams, whose very first car was also the famous car.Williams loved that car and gave it the nickname 'Ginger' before passing it over to her niece as a gift after eight years behind the wheel. The Grand Slam superstar is now back in control of her beloved SUV, albeit a more modern version.Sports stars are the envy of their fans as not only do they get to play the sport they love for a living, but they also get amazing sponsorship deals like this. Brands will clamor to get the best athletes' faces next to their products, and it's a win-win for these superstars.Serena Loves Her MiniElite athletes spend a lot of their time in the spotlight. They can hold the gaze of thousands of fans at an arena and millions more who are watching at home. There is a lot of pressure on a professional sports star to live exemplary lives, but it's worth remembering that they are people too.Williams' 2016Mini Countrymanwas made famous in 2017 after she was pulled over by the police for a speeding infringement. Getting caught speeding isn't that uncommon, as sometimes we're running a little late, and we need to put the pedal to the metal. Unlike your average Joe, when Williams was caught speeding, it became national news.Serena Adorns Her Aston Martin VanquishAs we mentioned already, being a world-famous sports star has its benefits. Before Williams was a brand ambassador for Lincoln, she was the face of Aston Martin. Being the face of such a famous luxury sports car brand came with the perks most gearheads can only dream about, getting an Aston Martin for free.Williams gained control ofthe 5.9-liter V12 Vanquishuntil she switched allegiance to Lincoln in 2018. The Vanquish is a perfect blend of power and style, something that compliments the way Williams approaches her tennis career.Williams is known for her powerful approach to playing tennis, but while she's on the court, she also considers style to be an important aspect. Besides being one of the all-time greats, Williams is also known as one of the most stylish tennis players on the circuit.RELATED:10 Cool Facts Everyone Forgot About Aston Martin's Sports CarsSerena Williams Has A Bentley Continental GTAlexander Migl Via Wikimedia CommonsIt would seem that Williams looks for luxury above most other characteristics when getting behind the wheel of a new car. The multiple Grand Slam winner is one of the highest-earning stars on tour, and she puts those winnings to good use with her car collection.With Williams conquering Wimbledon five times, it seems she has a lot of fun in Britain. Perhaps that affinity for British soil has endeared theBentley Continental GTto Williams. The Continental GT comes with a 4.0-liter V8 engine and maxes out at 198 mph. Power and elegance are once again the standout characteristics of a Serena Williams car, this time, it's the one and only Bentley Continental GT.Serena Williams Rolls In A Mercedes-Benz G-WagonWagon Master 2.0 Via Wikimedia CommonsSerena Williams proved she wouldn't be eating other celebrities' dust when keeping up with the latest car trends. The tennis superstar, like so many other wealthy and powerful people, gets behind the wheel ofa Mercedes G-Wagon. Otherwise, known as the G-Class, this legendary SUV has been around since the 1970s in different guises until the current crop appeared in 1992.Although not always desirable, the G-Wagon has become popular thanks to stars like Williams, Kevin Hart, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Kylie Jenner. Equipped with a 4.0-liter V8, the G-Class can handle just about anything you wish to throw at it.The SUV will get you from A to B in a hurry on the roads or make light work of any type of rough terrain you like. No matter the situation, the G-Wagon remains pure luxury on the inside. It means that even if her G-Class is caked in mud from a trip off-road, Williams can step onto the red carpet without missing a beat.Sources: Washingtonpost, Serena Williams Via InstagramShareTweetShareShareCopyEmailShareShareTweetShareShareCopyEmailLink copied to clipboardRelated TopicsFamous CollectionsCar CultureSports CarsAbout The AuthorConnor Doyle(86 Articles Published)Connor is a content writer and journalist from the UK with several years in the business.

She also wants to look good, not only when she’s competing fiercely at a tournament but also when she’s driving to one. And she’s a mom who appreciates a car’ssafetyand comfort, for both her young daughter Olympia and herself.With a net worth of $180 million, she could afford any car that suits her fancy. And in years past, the vehicles in her car collection included anAston Martin Valkyrieand aBentley Continental GT.But Serena Williams has held a deep affection for another car over the years. It’s not a supercar. Instead, it’s a car within reach of people who aren’t celebrities or millionaires: aLincoln Navigator.Serena Williams’ first carView this post on Instagram#Navigator has been part of my story since I was 19.  Now, I’m excited to be part of theirs. #adA post shared bySerena Williams(@serenawilliams) onFeb 19, 2018 at 6:00am PSTWhen Serena Williams was in her late teens,she bought a Lincoln Navigator, as PopSugar reported. The SUV was her first car, and she named it Ginger. She happily drove it for eight years before giving it to her niece.At the time Williams bought the Navigator, it was on the rise asone of the first true full-size luxury SUVs. In 1998, its first model year, it had the stability, safety, and size of the Ford Expedition that it was styled after. But it also boasted elegant touches such as lighted running boards and chrome door handles. The SUV’s interior was well-appointed with leather bucket seats and a wood-trimmed steering wheel.The Navigator that the tennis pro drove also had a powerful 5.4-liter V8 engine that made 300 hp and featured a four-speed automatic transmission. It was the same engine used in the Ford Expedition, the Ford F-150, and the ill-fatedLincoln Blackwood. It had a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive configuration but an all-wheel-drive option was also available.The SUV’s luxury and sheer automotive presence understandably made Williams feel secure and successful, even as a teenager. It was a car she loved to drive, and she had fond memories of it long after she gave it away.Coming full circle with the NavigatorThese memories helped to persuade Serena Williams to become the Navigator’s brand ambassador last year. In the recent commercial that the tennis star made for the fourth-generation Navigator, it’s clear that it’s a cozy, sumptuous haven for her. Her endorsement, we’d venture to say, comes across as much more heartfelt and genuine than anythingMatthew McConaugheyever produced for Lincoln. And she does it without saying a word.Today Lincoln’s flagship SUV is still a stronghold of luxury and power. It has a starting price of over $73,000, as compared to the $43,000 or so that Williams paid some 20 years ago.The Navigator now shares a 450-hp twin-turbo 3.5-liter V6 engine with theFord F-150 Raptor. It uses a 10-speed automatic transmission that is the product of a joint venture of Ford and GM.View this post on InstagramA giant among giants. The 2019 Lincoln Navigator, shot in the forest by @GrxntAnderson.  #MyLincoln⠀ .⠀ .⠀ #2019lincolnnavigator #lincolnnavigator #navigator #luxuryauto #luxurylifestyle #luxurycars #troymi #troymotormall #troy #lincolnoftroy #lincolnmotorcompany #detroit #lincoln #blacklabel #instacar #auto #cargram #carsofinstagram #لينكونA post shared byLincoln of Troy(@lincolnoftroy) onApr 3, 2019 at 5:26am PDTBoth short-wheelbase (SWB) and a long-wheelbase (L) versions are available for this SUV. The SWB version is a behemoth with a wheelbase of 119.0 inches, but the wheelbase of the Navigator L variant is even longer at 131.0 inches.The height of the Navigator also makes it imposing. It measures 78.3 inches—significantly taller than the 1998 two-wheel-drive model at 72.7 inches. A hefty vehicle, it tips the scales at nearly three tons.Interior specsThe interior of the Navigator holds its own for comfort and style among other SUVs of its size. It has heated leather captains chairs in the front and, in some models, the second row as well. It also offers 10-way massaging front seats, which Williams demonstrates in the commercial. They are so customizable that the left and right thigh supports can be adjusted individually to different heights.Tech in this luxury SUV includes a 10-inch infotainment screen and three-zone climate control, both of which are featured in Williams’ commercial. The L model with a higher trim level offers a 20-speaker sound system.The Navigator still rules among three-row luxury SUVs forcargo space. Behind the third row is 19.3 cubic feet of cargo space which can be expanded to a whopping 103.3 cubic feet if both the second and third rows are folded.Standard safety features are somewhat limited in the 2019 version of the Navigator, with blind-spot monitoring and cross-traffic alert being the main ones. Others, such as adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, are available as options.But the2020 Lincoln Navigatorwill offer a wider range of standard safety features including forward collision warning, lane-keeping assist, and rear-view cameras.A great pick from a winner as well as from a few othersThe winner of 23 Grand Slams isn’t the only one who appreciates the Lincoln Navigator. U.S. News & World Report has chosen it as its#1 large luxury SUV.Kelley Blue Bookhas given it a consumer rating of 4.7 out of five stars. While Car and Driver groused a little about its handling, it still praised theNavigator’s elegance and power.Strength. Style. Confidence. These words describe both Serena Williams and the Lincoln Navigator perfectly. And both, as the saying goes, have arrived.Tags:CelebritiesLincolnInstagramYoutubeFacebookTwitterAbout UsContact UsCareersOwnership funding advertising infoCorrections CommitmentFact checking commitmentEthicsShowbiz Cheat SheetEndgame360Sportscasting© Copyright 2023 Endgame360 Inc.

Lincoln Teams Up With Tennis Legend Serena Williams for 2018 NavigatorClose AdNewsReviewsBuyer's GuideWatchMotorTrend+The FutureJoinJoinNewsReviewsBuyer's GuideWatchMotorTrend+The FutureJoin MotorTrend| NewsLincoln Teams Up With Tennis Legend Serena Williams for 2018 NavigatorDigital Ad Campaign Features Williams and Her Love for NavigatorBrett T. EvansWriterFeb 15, 2018See all 3 photosLincoln kicked off a digital ad campaign today featuring tennis star Serena Williams promoting the all-new2018 Navigator. Williams, who is a 23-time Grand Slam champion, is joining the ad campaign as a longtime fan of the Navigator—her first car was a first-generation Navi, bought brand new when she was “18 or 19,” she says.That first Lincoln, lovingly named Ginger, carted the Williams sisters to and from practice for eight years before being handed down to Serena’s niece.“I’ve always had a connection to the Navigator brand,” said Williams. “When I bought my first car, Ginger, it was my big step-up. I had a real luxury car now, it looked great and I felt safe. When the opportunity came to work with the Lincoln Navigator today, I was really excited because it brought me back to all of those moments I had in my first vehicle. For me, partnering with a brand like Navigator comes from a genuine place.”See all 3 photosThe ad campaign, which will appear on social media for both Lincoln and Serena Williams, will highlight parts of the sports legend’s life that the Navigator makes easier. “The luxury of the Navigator is amazing,” she says. “When I show up to a tournament, I have to show up looking right.” She also says the big SUV is like a second bedroom for her daughter, Olympia, thanks to their busy schedule.That first Navigator that Williams owned was arguably one of the first body-on-frame fullsize luxury SUVs. However, after two generations in which the Navi languished as a barely warmed-over Expedition, the newest generation sets itself apart from its predecessors with more unique styling, a rich interior, and added capability and efficiency. The new Navigator has been so popular since its introduction that Ford had toadd productionat the Kentucky plant where the luxury SUV is built.Source: LincolnSee all 3 photosTrending PagesRotary Engine Evolution: What to Look for and How to TuneUTI Automotive Trade School Named to 2023 Military Friendly Schools ListRivian Pickup Truck Patent Shows Innovative Bedside Storage SystemGerman Tuner Constructs Solar Charging Roof Panels for the VW ID Buzz EVWatch This Electric Chinese Supercar Jump in Place and...

This was her 14th Grand Slam singles title out of 18 finals, which was identical to Pete Sampras' career record.Williamswas asked in her post-match press conference if that stat meant anything to her. The American was understandably excited, and revealed that she lovedSamprasduring her younger days, even naming her dog Jackie Baila Pete after the seven-time Wimbledon champion."Oh, wow. I didn't really know that. I really loved Pete when I was younger. My dog's name is Jackie Baila Pete after Pete Sampras, so obviously I'm a little bit obsessed. So, yeah, I mean, I didn't realize it was the same stats," Williams said."With my dad by my side we were able to say a loving goodbye" - Serena Williams on the passing of her dog Jackie Baila Pete in 2015Williams at the 2022 US OpenSerena Williams got her dog Jackie Baila Pete Williams shortly after winning her first Grand Slam title at the 1999 US Open. However, she died in 2015, following which Williams penned an emotional message for her on Instagram."Today really is hard for me. My special friend in which I got at 17 (2 weeks before I won my very first Grand Slam) left me today. She was 16 years young and up until a few days ago was still sprinting," Serena Williams wrote."Her poor body gave out this morning and she had a way of telling me it was time for me to be brave and let her go. With my dad by my side we were able to say a loving goodbye,"she added.Serena Williams ended her message by stating that she would miss Jackie and that her memory would live on forever."She was with me from 1999 until today and I miss her so much. I got out of the shower this afternoon and she was not there to lick my leg as she always did everyday to remind me how much she loved me," Williams said."I feel so lucky to have such a special friend. Give your dog, cat, pet a big hug. Jackie Baila Pete Williams I will miss you and your memory will live forever," she added.View this post on InstagramInstagram PostIs Serena Williams a Jehovah's Witness?Why American legend doesn't celebrate birthdays or ChristmasPoll :0 votesQuick LinksSerena WilliamsTennis ThrowbacksMore from SportskeedaEdited by Shyam Kamal×FeedbackThank You!Be the first one to commentFollow UsShareShow More CommentsMore from SportskeedaFetching more content...1✕✕🔍 SearchNo Results FoundGet the free App nowAdvertise On SK🔥 Popular🏃🏻‍♀️ Sports (30+)CricketCricket HomeScheduleIPL 2023NZ vs SLBAN vs IREECS T10 GibraltarPlunket ShieldICCA Arabian T20 LeagueAustralia One Day CupHong Kong SeriesSharjah Hundred LeagueSheffield ShieldFootballFootball HomeNewslettersEPLScheduleFIFA WCNations LeagueLa LigaLigue 1Champions LeagueMLSBundesligaSerie ANetherlands vs USA live scoreArgentina vs Australia live scoreFrance vs Poland Live ScoreEngland vs Senegal Live ScoreWWEWWE HomeWWE WrestleMania 39Sportskeeda Wrestling AwardsRumor RoundupRAWNewslettersSmackDownResultsRosterChampionsWWE Crown Jewel 2022PPV ScheduleAEWEsportsEsports HomeFortniteCounter-Strike 2MinecraftRobloxGenshin ImpactModern warfare 2GTAValorantPop CultureAnimeFIFA 23PUBGStreamersBGMIGaming TechWiki GuidesTennisTennis HomeTennis calendarMonte Carlo Masters 2023Monte Carlo Masters ScheduleATP RankingsWTA RankingsRoger FedererRafael NadalCarlos AlcarazNovak DjokovicSerena WilliamsAndy MurrayMMAMMA HomeUFC NewsONE ChampionshipUFC Fight NightScheduleRankingsResultsUFC Fights TonightONE Championship ResultsONE Championship ScheduleONE Championship RankingsKabaddiKabaddi HomePKL 2022PKL SchedulePKL Points TableKabaddi RulesWikiWiki HomeMinecraft WikiNaruto WikiTikTok WikiYoutube WikiGTA WikiTerraria WikiOne Piece WikiCommunity HubMoreSportsBasketballIndian FootballNFLMinecraftFormula 1NascarPop CultureCollege FootballHockeyGolfAthleticsBadmintonGymnasticsWrestlingSwimmingTennisShootingBoxingArcheryWinter SportsRobloxFree PicksSkateboardingKho KhoLifestyleMMO🔗 LINKSAbout UsWrite For UsPoliciesEditorial StandardsJournalism AwardsFact CheckAffiliate ProgramCareersCSRPrivacy PolicyContact UsEdition:Englishहिन्दी

She is best known for being both the mother and coach ofVenusandSerena Williams, who are both widely regarded among the best tennis players of all time. She is the former wife ofRichard Williams, whom she divorced in 2002.Biography[edit]Nicknamed "Brandy", Price was born in Saginaw, Michigan in 1952. Her father was an automotive worker from theMississippi Delta.[1]She graduated from Buena Vista High School in 1970 and fromWestern Michigan University.[1][2]She has three daughters from a previous marriage to Yusef Rasheed:Yetunde Price(1972–2003),[3]who was a former beauty salon owner and registered nurse; Lyndrea Price, a Web designer; and Isha Price, a lawyer. After Rasheed's death, while working as a nurse, Oracene marriedRichard Williamsand had two more daughters,Venus WilliamsandSerena Williams. Both Venus and Serena are high-ranked professional tennis players who have won numerousGrand Slamtournaments. She helped her husband as he began coaching Venus and Serena in tennis. The Williams family moved toFloridaon the offer ofRick Maccito coach their daughters for free.[4][5]By the end of 2000, Price was no longer living with her husband Richard Williams, and citing irreconcilable differences, they divorced in 2002. She reverted to her maiden name of Price.[6][7]During a semifinal match between Serena  andJustine Heninat the2003 French Open, Williams was booed by fans after a complaint about a line call. Price believes that the boos were motivated by race, saying "We, as black people, live with this all the time. It's all about control."[8]Tennis journalist and authorL. Jon Wertheimhas said of Price, "You have to respect anyone incapable of gloss or spin (i.e., unwilling to lie)."[9]Price describes herself as a deeply spiritual woman.[10]Price also has described herself as being a "rampantfeminist" when dealing with the overly sexualized images of women in the media.[11]She traveled to Kenya with her daughter Serena for charity work, as well as Senegal to aid in the construction of schools.[10]Price was portrayed byAunjanue Ellisin the 2021 biopicKing Richard. Ellis was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actressfor her performance while the film itself was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Picture.Coaching[edit]Price's coaching has arguably been overshadowed by her role as mother, but as a coach she has been called underappreciated.[12]Price is not a coach in a traditional sense (though she did learn tennis herself to help teach her daughters the technical aspects of the game) and is instead credited, along with Richard  for helping to build a solid foundation of self-esteem and outside interests for her daughters.[13]Venus and Serena's "poise under pressure"[14]is often credited to the self-belief instilled in them by their mother. "There's no such thing as pressure," says Price. "As black Americans, that's all we've ever had. It's life. So where's the pressure?"[15]This approach was coupled with, according to noted tennis coachNick Bollettieri, a respect that meant that neither Price nor Richard Williams raised their voices to their daughters.[16]Journalist Bonnie D. Ford has said that the longevity exhibited by the Williams sisters is directly attributable to their parents and the way that Richard Williams and Price have helped them manage their careers and lives. Ford believes it is especially admirable that Price and her former husband have continued to remain jointly supportive despite their separation.[17]References[edit]^abEdmondson, Jacqueline (2005).Venus and Serena Williams : a biography.

Richard was also, famously, their childhood tennis coach. Smith portrays Richard while newcomers Demi Singleton and Saniyya Sidney play Serena and Venus, respectively.Recalling how their mother, Oracene Price, was the backbone of the family early on in the siblings' tennis careers, Serena tells Smith about the time their father quit his job to solely focus on being a coach."My dad at one point was working and then, he stopped," she says. "He's like, 'This is what we're going to do. I'm not going to have a job. I'm gonna go with Venus and Serena, and train them every day.' Now that would be impossible for me if my husband [Alexis Ohanian] were to tell me that."Serena, 40, and Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit and an entrepreneur, wed in 2017 and share 4-year-old daughter Olympia.Facebook WatchSerena and Venus Williams PraiseKing Richard, Call Biopic a 'Perfect Way' to Tell Family StoryFacebook Watch"I'd be like, 'I kinda worked my whole life. I'm trying to relax a little bit,' " says the mom of one, imagining what her reaction would be if Ohanian suddenly stopped working."But she had to support seven people, as a family of seven," Serena notes looking at her mom who was also seated around the red table with Smith and her daughters Isha and Lyndrea Price, who are Serena and Venus' half-sisters. (Eldest half-sister Yetunde Price was tragically killed in 2003.)Crediting the matriarch, Serena says neither she nor Venus would be the successful athletes they are today without their mom."To have that faith and to have that back end support, we wouldn't have survived without that," she shares.Will Smith Gave Cash Bonuses to HisKing RichardCostars: 'I Couldn't Believe It'Price, who is portrayed in the biopic by actress Aunjanue Ellis, was also Serena and Venus' coach and helped the pair win 149 titles, including 44 Grand Slams and four Olympic gold medals."They had goals in mind.

He’s their father, but he’s other.In 1999, Williamswas suspectedof breaking three of Price’s ribs. He was never charged, as Williams claimed she broke them on a door handle, but the marriage was clearly falling apart.

She then took a break from professional tennis after becoming pregnant and reached four major finals upon returning to play. In August 2022, Williams announced her impending "evolution" away from professional tennis and played what was expected to be her final match at the2022 US Open.[21]Williams also won 14 major women's doubles titles, all with her sister Venus, and the pair was unbeaten in major doubles finals (the best unbeaten record in major finals in any discipline of the sport).[22][23]The pair achieved a non-calendar year Grand Slam between the2009 Wimbledon Championshipsand the2010 French Open, which granted the sisters thedoubles world No. 1 ranking. Serena won fourOlympic gold medals, three in women's doubles—an all-time joint record in tennis, shared with her sister.[24][25]The duo are the only women in the Open Era to win Olympic gold in both singles and doubles.[26]She also won two major mixed doubles titles, both in 1998. She is the only singles player, male or female, to complete three Career Golden Slams – one in women's singles and two in same-sex doubles.[19]The arrival of theWilliams sistershas been credited with ushering in a new era of power and athleticism on the women's professional tennis tour.[27][28][29][30]Serena holds a combined 39 major titles: 23 in singles, 14 in women's doubles, and two in mixed doubles. She isjoint-third on the all-time listand second in the Open Era for total major titles. She is the most recent woman to simultaneously hold all four major singles titles (2002–03 and 2014–15), and the most recent woman to win theSurface Slam(major titles onhard,clayandgrasscourts in the same calendar year), doing so in 2015. She is also, with Venus, the most recent player to have simultaneously held all four major women's doubles titles (2009–10).Williams was the world's highest paid woman athlete in 2016, earning almost $29 million.[31]She repeated this feat in 2017 when she was the only woman onForbes'list of the 100 highest-paid athletes, with $27million in prize money and endorsements. She won theLaureus Sportswoman of the Yearaward a record four times (2003, 2010, 2016, 2018), and in December 2015 was namedSportsperson of the YearbySports Illustratedmagazine.[32]She is the highest-earning woman athlete of all time.[33]Early lifeWilliams was born on September 26, 1981, inSaginaw, MichigantoOracene PriceandRichard Williams. She is the youngest of Price's five daughters: half-sistersYetunde, Lyndrea, and Isha Price, and full older sisterVenus.[1]She also has at least seven paternal half-siblings.[34][35]When the children were young, the family moved toCompton, California, where she started playing tennis at age four.[36][37]Her father home-schooled her and her sister, Venus.[38][39]While he and subsequently her mother have been their official coaches, her other mentors have included Richard Williams, a Compton man who shared her father's name and subsequently founded The Venus and Serena Williams Tennis Tutorial Academy.[40]Williams sisters at aPam Shriverevent in Baltimore, 1993When Williams was nine, she and her family moved from Compton toWest Palm Beach, Florida[36]so she could attend the tennis academy ofRick Macci, who provided her with additional coaching. Macci did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls".[41]Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, as he wanted them to "go slowly" and focus on school work. Experiences of racism also influenced this decision, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments.[42]At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on theUnited States Tennis Associationjunior tour and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida.[43]In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether it would have been more beneficial for them to have followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit, Williams responded, "Everyone does different things. I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us."[43]Professional career1995–1998: Professional debutWilliams' parents wanted their daughter to wait until she was 16 to participate in professional tournaments.[44]In 1995, just after turning 14, Williams planned to make her professional debut as awild-cardentry in theBank of the West ClassicinOakland, California, but was denied by the WTA owing to their age-eligibility restrictions.[45]She subsequently filed an antitrust lawsuit against the women's tour, but withdrew it at her parents' request.[45]Her first professional event was in October 1995 at theBell ChallengeinQuebec,[44][46]where she used a wild-card entry to circumvent age-eligibility rules.[44]She lost in the first qualifying round to then 18-year-old AmericanAnnie Miller, winning just two games.[47]Williams did not play a tournament in 1996. The next year, she lost in the qualifying rounds of three tournaments,[48]before winning her first main-draw match in November at theAmeritech Cup Chicago.[49]Ranked No. 304, she upset No. 7Mary Pierce, and No. 4Monica Seles,[50][51]recording her first career wins over top10 players and becoming the lowest-ranked player in the Open Era to defeat two top-10 opponents in one tournament.[1]She ultimately lost in the semifinals to No. 5Lindsay Davenport.[52]She finished 1997 ranked No. 99.[53]Williams began 1998 at theMedibank International Sydney.[54]As a qualifier ranked No. 96,[55]she defeated No. 3 Davenport in the quarterfinals,[55]before losing toArantxa Sánchez Vicarioin the semifinals.[56]Williams made her debut in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament at theAustralian Open,[57]where she defeated sixth-seededIrina Spîrleain the first round,[58]before losing to her sister, Venus, in the second round in the sisters' first professional match.[58][54]She reached six other quarterfinals during the year, but lost all of them,[59]including her first match against No. 1-rankedMartina Hingisat theLipton International Players Championshipsin Key Biscayne,[60]and her second match against Venus at theItalian Openin Rome.[59]She failed to reach the quarterfinals of any Grand Slam tournament the remainder of the year,[citation needed]losing in the fourth round of the French Open to Arantxa Sánchez Vicario,[61]and the third round of theUS Opento Spîrlea.[62]She withdrew fromWimbledontwo games into a match withVirginia Ruano Pascual, after straining a calf muscle during the first set.[63]She did win the mixed doubles titles atWimbledonand theUS OpenwithMax Mirnyi, completing the Williams family's sweep of the 1998 mixed doubles Grand Slam tournaments. She won her first professional title in doubles at theU.S. National Indoor Championshipsin Oklahoma City with Venus, becoming the third pair of sisters to win a WTA title.[1]They won two more doubles titles that year. Williams finished the year ranked No. 20 in singles.[citation needed]Battle of the sexes: Karsten Braasch vs. the Williams sistersMain article:Battle of the Sexes (tennis)A 16-year-old Serena and her sister Venus competed in a tennis "Battle of the Sexes" againstKarsten Braaschat the 1998 Australian Open.[64]At the time Braasch was 203rd in the ATP rankings. The sisters had claimed they could beat any man outside the top 200, and accepted his challenge. Braasch beat both of them, playing one set against each. The score versus Serena was 6–1 and 6–2 against Venus.[65]Braasch said afterward, "500 and above, no chance." The sisters later tweaked the number to beating men outside the top 350.[66]1999–2001: Becoming a top-10 playerWilliams lost in the third round of the1999 Australian OpentoSandrine Testud. A month later, Williams won her first professional singles title when she defeatedAmélie Mauresmoin the final of theOpen Gaz de Francein Paris.

Soon afterward at theMiami Masters, Williams had her 16-match winning streak ended by her sister in the first all-sister singles final in WTA history,[54]and she then made her top-10 debut, at No. 9. She then lost in the quarterfinals of theItalian Open[68]and theGerman Open,[69]and the third round of theFrench Open,[70]where she and Venus won the women's doubles title.[54]Williams then missedWimbledonbecause of injury.

Williams successfully defended her title in Los Angeles, defeating Davenport in the final. She reached the final of theDu Maurier Openwhere an injury forced her to retire from her match with Hingis. Her defense of theUS Opentitle ended when she lost in the quarterfinals to Davenport. Williams teamed with Venus to win the gold medal in doubles at theSydney Olympicsthat September. She ended the year winning theToyota Princess Cupin Japan and she finished the year ranked No. 6.[citation needed]Williams began 2001 losing to Martina Hingis in the quarterfinals of the Medibank International inSydneyand the Australian Open in Melbourne. Williams and her sister won the doubles title at the latter tournament, becoming only the fifth doubles team in history to win all four Grand Slam women's doubles titles during their career, completing a "Career Grand Slam". Her next event was thePacific Life Openin California, where she defeated Kim Clijsters in the final. The final was marred by the behavior of the crowd toward Williams and her family. Crowd members were incensed at the perceived match-fixing of games involving the family afterVenus withdrewbefore their semifinal. Neither Williams nor her sister entered the tournament for fourteen years until Williams entered in 2015 as a wildcard (and the top seed).[72]The following week at theEricsson Openin Miami, Williams lost toJennifer Capriatiin the quarterfinals. She then lost in the quarterfinals to Capriati at both theFrench OpenandWimbledon Championships. That was the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament at which Williams had exited in the quarterfinals. During the North American hard-court season, she lost in the quarterfinals ofLos Angelesagainst Monica Seles, then captured her second title of the year at theRogers Cup, defeating Capriati in the final. Williams reached the final of the 2001 US Open, losing to sister Venus. That was the first Grand Slam tournament final contested by two sisters during the Open Era. At the 2001 season-endingTour Championships, Williams won the championship by walkover when Davenport withdrew before the start of the final because of a knee injury. Williams finished 2001 at No. 6 for the second straight year.[citation needed]2002–2003: "Serena Slam"Early 2002, injury saw Williams retire from the semifinal at theMedibank International Sydneyand later withdraw from theAustralian Open.[73]Playing Amélie Mauresmo in the quarterfinals of the tournament in Sydney in 2002Returning from injury, Williams won her first title of the year inScottsdale, Arizona, defeating No. 2 Jennifer Capriati, in the final.

Williams was the third seed at the French Open at Roland Garros, where she claimed her first title thereby defeating defending champion Capriati in the semifinals and sister Venus in the final to win her second Grand Slam tournament title (and her first in two-and-a-half years). As a result of raising the trophy atCourt Philippe Chatrier, Williams rose to a career-high of No. 2, second only to Venus.[citation needed]At the2002 Wimbledon Championships, Williams won tennis's oldest championship for the first time in her life, defeating Venus to win a Grand Slam singles title without dropping a set for the first time in her career. This victory earned Williams the world No. 1 ranking for the first time, dethroning her sister and becoming only the third African American woman to hold that ranking.[1]The Williams sisters also won the doubles title at the tournament, the fifth Grand Slam doubles title for the pair. Williams played just one tournament between Wimbledon and theUS Open, losing in the quarterfinals of theJPMorgan Chase Openin Los Angeles to AmericanChanda Rubinand ending a 21-match winning streak.

Williams won two consecutive singles titles in the fall, defeating Kim Clijsters to win theToyota Princess Cupin Tokyo, andAnastasia Myskinato win theSparkassen Cupin Leipzig, Germany. She reached the final at the year-endHome Depot Championshipsat theStaples Centerin Los Angeles, where she lost to fifth-seeded Clijsters in straight sets, ending an 18-match winning streak.[citation needed]Williams finished 2002 with a 56–5 W/L record, eight singles titles, and the No. 1 ranking. She was the first African-American to end a year with that ranking sinceAlthea Gibsonin 1958[citation needed]and was the first woman to win three Grand Slam tournament titles in one year since Hingis in 1997.[1]Her three consecutive Grand Slam titles to close 2002 also made Williams only the third player in tennis history to win the "Surface Slam",[75]three Slam titles on three surfaces in the same calendar year, after Navratilova (1984) and Graf (1993, 1995, 1996).[citation needed]At the2003 Australian Open, Williams reached the tournament's semifinals for the first time, where she recovered from 5–1 down in the third set and saved two match points before defeating Clijsters. In the final, Serena faced Venus for the fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament final, defeating her older sister to become the sixth woman in the Open Era to complete a career Grand Slam, alongsideMargaret Court,Billie Jean King,Chris Evert,Martina Navratilova, andSteffi Graf. She also became the fifth woman to hold all Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously, joiningMaureen Connolly Brinker, Court, Graf, and Navratilova. This feat was dubbed the "Serena Slam" by the press.[76][77]TheWilliams sisterswon their sixth Grand Slam doubles title together at this event.[78]During the spring of 2003, Williams captured the singles titles at theOpen Gaz de Franceand theSony Ericsson Open. Williams's winning streak came to an end when she lost the final of theFamily Circle Cupto Henin, her first loss of the year after 21 wins. She also lost to Mauresmo in the semifinals of theInternazionali BNL d'Italiain Rome. Despite these losses, Williams was the top seed at theFrench Open, where she lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Henin, marking Williams's first loss in a Grand Slam tournament since 2001. The match was controversial, as Williams questioned Henin's sportsmanship, and spectators applauded Williams's errors.[79]Williams rebounded from the French Open loss a couple weeks later at the2003 Wimbledon Championships, defeating Henin in the semifinals and Venus in the final. This was Williams's second consecutive Wimbledon title and her sixth Grand Slam singles title overall. Wimbledon was Williams's last tournament of 2003; she pulled out of three events in the US and then underwent surgery on the quadriceps tendon in her knee in early August. Williams was initially expected to be out for six to eight weeks.[80]2004–2007: Injuries and the comebackMain articles:2004,2005,2006, and2007 Serena Williams tennis seasonAfter eight months away from the tour, during which time her desire was questioned,[81]Williams began her comeback at the 2004NASDAQ-100 Openin Miami in March, where she made a triumphant return as she won the title for the third consecutive year.Delivering a serve at an exhibition in November 2004Although ranked No. 7, Williams was seeded second at the French Open, where, after winning four matches, she lost to Capriati in the quarterfinals. That was the first time that Williams had lost before the semifinals at a Grand Slam singles tournament since Wimbledon in 2001. A few weeks later, even though her ranking had dropped to No. 10, Williams was seeded first atWimbledon. She won six matches en route to the final, where 13th-seededMaria Sharapovadefeated her in straight sets. This loss caused her ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the first time since 1999. Later that summer, Williams reached her third final of the year at the JPMorgan Chase Open in Los Angeles where she lost to Lindsay Davenport which was her first loss to the American since the 2000 US Open. After missing her national championship in 2003, Williams returned for the2004 US Open, where she was seeded third despite her No. 11 ranking. She lost in the U.S. Open quarterfinals to Capriati in three sets in controversial fashion.[82]That fall, Williams won her second title of the year, at theChina Open, defeating US Open championSvetlana Kuznetsovain the final. Williams's successful season allowed her to qualify for theTour Championships, held again in Los Angeles. In the round-robin phase of the tournament, Williams defeated Dementieva andAnastasia Myskinaand lost to Davenport, but still advanced to the elimination stage. After winning her semifinal, she lost to Sharapova in the final, where she suffered an abdominal injury.[83]Williams finished 2004 ranked No. 7, but did not win a Grand Slam singles tournament for the first season since 2001.[citation needed]At the2005 Australian Open, Williams rejected suggestions that she and sister Venus were a declining force in tennis, following Venus's early exit.[84]Williams saved three match points to defeat Sharapova 8–6 in the third of their semifinal.

Williams played just one more match that fall, a loss to No. 127Sun Tiantianat thetournament in Beijing. She failed to qualify for the year-end championship for the first time since 1998 and she finished the year 2005 ranked No. 11, her first time finishing the season outside the top 10 since 1998.[citation needed]Williams made her 2006 debut at theAustralian Open. Defending the title, Williams lost toDaniela Hantuchováin the third round.[90]After the tournament, she told the press that she was injured, blaming a lack of fitness and a knee injury for keeping her off the court.[91]In her biography, Williams claims that she was actually suffering from depression. She stayed away from pro tennis for six months during the 2006 season. After she had shut herself off from the world for a period, Williams saw a therapist daily.[92]After a chance meeting with a young girl who idolized Williams and believed that she could still win, Williams signed up to play in Cincinnati,[93]her first tournament since Melbourne. Williams had slipped to No. 139, the lowest ranking she had held since 1997. On her return, Williams defeated Myskina andBethanie Mattek,[94][95]before losing in the semifinals toVera Zvonareva.[96]She also reached the semifinals in Los Angeles, losing to Janković in straight sets. At theUS Open, Williams needed a wildcard to enter the tournament, as her ranking at the cut-off time was No. 139, outside the automatic 102. Her ranking had improved to 79th by the time the tournament came around.[97]She lost to top-seeded Mauresmo in the fourth round.[98]Following the US Open, she did not play again in 2006, ending the year ranked No. 95, her lowest year-end ranking since 1997.[citation needed]Williams began 2007 with renewed confidence, stating her intention to return to the top of the rankings,[99]a comment 1987 Wimbledon men's singles champion and commentatorPat Cashbranded "deluded".[100]Williams lost in the quarterfinals of theHobart International, a warm-up for theAustralian Openwhere Williams was unseeded because of her No. 81 ranking and was widely regarded as "out of shape".[101]She experienced a huge amount of pressure on herself before the tournament, coming from her fans and the press as well as Williams herself about her weight, focus and needing a good showing.[citation needed]Shortly before her first match, a representative from Nike paid her a visit in the players' lounge, informing her that if she did not perform to her accustomed level, the company might drop her. Williams claimed that Nike's ultimatum meant that she would have to reach the quarterfinals at least.[102]The distraction from Nike did not distract Williams, as she lost just three games toMara Santangeloand defeated Anne Kremer in straight sets.[103]By this point, a blister had developed on Williams's foot and she had contracted a cold. In the third round, Williams found herself two points away from going home againstNadia Petrova, but fought back to win in three sets, which was her first win over a top-10 player since defeating Lindsay Davenport in the 2005 Australian Open final. Williams then made it to the final, defeating Janković, Pe'er and Vaidišová. Williams described them as "good players. Strong players. Players who certainly didn't expect an overweight, out-of-shape, has been champion like me to give them a game."[104]Williams also found herself two points from going out against Peer before turning it around.[105]By the time Williams had reached the final, the cold and blister had both left. Previewing the finals,Tracy Austinstated that, although Williams had a great tournament, she believed that the ride was over and that Sharapova would have no trouble with Williams. Williams thought it was mean and unnecessary and used it as motivation along with other criticism.[106]In the final, Williams lost just three games against Maria Sharapova, winning her first title at any tournament since winning the 2005 Australian Open 24 months prior.[105]Williams became the first player sinceChris O'Neilto win the title while not being seeded, and claimed her third Australian Open and eighth Grand Slam singles title overall.

Williams's match with Osaka was the first time the two had met in a major since the infamous2018 US Open final. When leaving the court after losing to Osaka in the Australian Open, Williams paused to acknowledge the crowd longer than she usually would. In the press conference following the match, she faced questions about whether she was bidding farewell to tennis and retiring. She said "I don't know, if I ever say farewell, I wouldn't tell anyone."[277]In May, at theItalian Open, Serena Williams played her 1000th match of her career.[278]She was defeated byNadia Podoroskain the second round in straight sets.[279]On June 29, Williams would suffer an injury during the first set in the first round atWimbledonagainst Belarusian playerAliaksandra Sasnovich, forcing her to withdraw from the competition.[280][281]In August 2021, a leg injury forced Williams to withdraw from2021 US Open.[282]Her withdrawal saw Williams plummet nineteen places to 41st in the world, her lowest year-end ranking in 15 years.2022:King Richardpromotion, Wimbledon and US Open, retirementThe Williams sisters in 2022 during their final doubles match togetherIn December 2021, Williams announced she would not play the2022 Australian Open, citing the same leg injury.[283]As of March 2022, she was ranked 241st.She spent much of early 2022 promotingKing Richardabout her father with her sisters.

She beatNuria Párrizas Díazin straight sets for her first singles win in 14 months, before losing toBelinda Bencic.[294][295]Williams subsequently entered the2022 Cincinnati Masters, in which she lost to reigning US Open championEmma Raducanuin the first round.[296]Before the US Open, Williams announced she would play doubles with Venus for the first time since 2018.

In her announcement she said that she disliked the word "retirement" and preferred the term "evolution".[298]She went on to cite growing her family, focusing on her venture capital firm, and spending more time with family as reasons she would be leaving the sport. While she did not set an exact time for her goodbye, she stated that she was not ready to winWimbledon(where shelost in the first round), but would try to win inNew York. She also said that she consultedTiger Woodsin her decision.[298]At her first match since the publication of theVoguearticle, where she lost toBelinda BencicinToronto, tournament organizers interviewed Williams on-court after her match and gave her gifts to remember the city.[299]At her matches at the2022 US Open, which many believed would be her last tournament, tournament directors played a video following her opponents' introduction but before Williams' walk-out. Some saw this as disrespectful to her opponents.[300]Following her first-round match, where Woods,Mike Tyson,Bill Clinton,Ruth Westheimer,Spike Lee,Vera Wang, andEric Adamswere in attendance, the tournament played a video narrated byOprah Winfreyand hadGayle Kingfacilitate the post-match on-court interview.[301][302][303]Following her announcement, many fellow players, includingNaomi OsakaandCoco Gauff, praised Williams and said they would not be playing tennis if not for her.[304]Playing styleWilliams is anaggressive baseliner, whose game is centered around her powerful serve and forceful groundstrokes. Owing to her high-risk playing style, she typically hits a large number of both winners and unforced errors. Williams' greatest asset is her serve, which is considered the greatest in the history of women's tennis. Her serve is known for its fast pace and accurate placement, allowing her to serve numerous aces: at the2013 Australian Open, she served a 128.6 mph (207 km/h) ace in her third round match againstAyumi Morita, which is the third fastest serve recorded in WTA history.[305]Williams possesses an accurate and consistent ball toss, allowing her to serve to any position on the court with minimal differences in the position of the ball in the air; this makes it difficult for opponents to read her service motion and predict the position of her serve, allowing her to dominate a rally from the first stroke.[306]Williams also possesses effective and accurate kick and slice serves, which she deploys as second serves, minimizing double faults, and preventing opponents from scoring free points.[307]Williams is also known for her forceful groundstrokes, which are considered two of the most powerful shots in the history of women's tennis.[308]She hits both her forehand and her backhand in an open stance, allowing her to generate consistently powerful, heavy, and dominating groundstrokes, and to generate sharp, acute angles, which allow her to hit winners from any position on the court.[309]Williams is known for her forehand, which has been described as "devastating".[310]Her forehand is hit with heavy topspin; this allows her to dominate rallies, and she is capable of hitting her forehand both crosscourt and down the line to produce winners.[311]Her two-handed backhand is equally dominant, and has been described as one of the greatest backhands of all time.[312]Williams tends to hit her backhand flatter than her forehand, allowing her to hit her backhand with speed, power, and depth both crosscourt and down the line. Despite playing primarily from the baseline, Williams is an adept net player thanks to her extensive doubles experience, and will frequently choose to finish points at the net, either with deft touch, aggressive drive volleys, or a solid, powerful, and reliable overhead smash.[313]Williams possesses an aggressive return of serve – she neutralizes powerful first serves, and attacks weak second serves. She is widely considered one of the greatest return players of all time.[314]Despite predominantly employing an aggressive game style, she is also an excellent defender, and is capable of counterpunching against aggressive opponents until she creates an opportunity to hit a winner. She is an exceptional athlete, known for her movement, speed, court coverage, agility, flexibility, balance, and footwork. Her on-court intelligence, shot selection, and point construction allow her to execute her gamestyle effectively.[315]She has been praised for her mental strength and competitive spirit, with her being described as one of the toughest opponents to beat on the court;Martina Navratilovadeclared her mental strength "unbelievable",[316]whilst tennis journalistJon Wertheimclaimed that Williams is the toughest player of all time.[317]American tennis playerChristina McHalepraised her composure in high pressure moments, stating that, for Williams, "being clutch is like breathing", and that she "seems to come through every single time in the most pressure-packed situations".[318]She has been noted for her ability to produce extraordinary comebacks, particularly on the Grand Slam level, winning three Slams after saving match points, a feat achieved more often than by any other player in tennis history.[319]Williams bounced back from a set down to win 37 Grand Slam matches; her ability to come back from set and break deficits in Grand Slam matches was described byJohn McEnroeas "a gift", and McEnroe declared that she was "the greatest" competitor in the history of women's tennis.[320]She has also been praised for her ability to serve aces at critical moments. As noted by retired playerLi Nain 2016, "break point down, [there is an] 80% chance [she] serves an ace".[321]Owing to her exceptional serve, powerful groundstrokes, technical mastery, aggressive return of serve, athleticism, and mental strength, Williams has been described as one of the most complete players on tour, and one of the greatest players of all time, irrespective of gender.[322]Williams has stated that her favourite surface is clay, as the slow pace and high bounce afforded aids point construction, although she also excels on faster hard and grass courts.[323]RivalriesSerena vs. VenusMain article:Williams sisters rivalryWilliams played older sisterVenusin 31 professional matches since 1998.[54]Overall, Serena is 19–12 against her sister.[54]Serena played Venus 15 times in Grand Slam singles and 13 times in other tournaments (including 11 finals).[324]They have met in nine Grand Slam tournament finals, with Serena winning seven times.[54]Beginning with the2002 French Open, they played each other in four consecutive Grand Slam finals, which was the first time in the Open Era that the same two players had contested four consecutive finals in Grand Slam singles.[325]Williams vs. HingisMain article:Hingis–S. Williams rivalryWilliams leads the series 7–6.[326]One of Williams's first rivalries was with Martina Hingis, who turned pro less than one year before her (Hingis in October 1994, Williams in 1995). They first played each other at the 1998 Miami Open where Hingis won in three sets. All but one of their matches was played on a hard court with the exception being a contest on clay in Rome 1999, which Hingis won in straight sets. Their last match took place at the 2002 Miami Open with Williams winning in a loss of just four games.[327]Hingis was forced to briefly retire citing ankle injuries.[328]Williams vs. CapriatiWilliams leads the series againstJennifer Capriati10–7.[329]Once considered one of the best rivalries in women's tennis,[330]the competition between Williams and Capriati was stiff with 12 out of 17 meetings going three sets. The rivalry, starting in 1999, began one sided with Capriati winning four of their first five matches. Williams would then go on to win the next eight.[329]Williams and Capriati played with similar styles, both known for using their power and athleticism to gain quick advantages in points.[331][332]Williams vs. HeninMain article:Henin–S. Williams rivalryWilliams leads the series 8–6.Justine Heninand Williams met 14 times, five of which were in tournament finals. In majors they have faced each other seven times with Henin leading 4–3.[333]Opposite personalities and styles of play are often cited as what made their rivalry entertaining.[334][335]In the semifinals of the2003 French Open, when at 4–2, 30–0 on Williams's serve in the third set, Henin raised her hand to indicate she was not ready to receive; Williams then put her serve into the net. The umpire did not see Henin raise her hand, and thus did not allow Williams a first serve. Williams lost the game and would go on to lose the match. Their last match took place in the final of the2010 Australian Openwhere Williams won in three sets to take her 12th major title.[333]Williams vs. AzarenkaWilliams leads the series 18–5. The rivalry began at the 2008 Australian Open, and their most recent match was in the semifinals of the 2020 US Open. Williams holds a 10–1 record in Grand Slams. Azarenka is the only person to ever win four WTA tour level finals against Williams.[336]While their rivalry is heavily favored towards Williams, their matches are known for their fierce competitiveness, and Azarenka is considered the only player to truly challenge Williams following the retirement of Capriati, Henin, and Hingis, with 9 of their matches extending to three sets.[337]Williams vs. SharapovaWilliams leads the series 20–2. The pair first met in the fourth round of the2004 Miami Open, where Williams defeated Sharapova 6–4, 6–3. Their rivalry truly began at the2004 Wimbledon final, where Williams was the two-time defending champion; Sharapova upset her 6–1, 6–4. Williams next lost to Sharapova in the finals of the2004 WTA Tour Championships, 6–4, 2–6, 4–6. Since then, however, Williams dominated the rivalry, winning all of their clashes, with only three of their matches going to three sets. They met 10 times in Grand Slam tournaments, where Williams led 9–1, and they further met in 9 finals, with Williams leading 7–2. Sharapova retired in February 2020, with their final match being in the first round of the2019 US Open; Williams defeated Sharapova 6–1, 6–1 in one hour exactly. Despite the one-sided nature of their rivalry, it is considered one of the most prominent rivalries on the WTA Tour of the 21st century, due to alleged personality clashes, similarly aggressive playing styles, and significant media interest.[338]Match controversiesAccusations of match fixingWhen both of the Williams sisters entered the top ten and started meeting in tournaments, rumors ofmatch fixingstarted to circulate.John McEnroe, while commenting on the 2000 Wimbledon semifinal between the two sisters, said that "Serena may not be allowed to win. Richard [Williams] may have something to say about this."[339]After losing to Venus at the Indian Wells quarterfinals in 2001,Elena Dementievaasserted during a post-match interview that Richard Williams decided the results of matches between the two sisters.[340]Shortly after that, Venus Williams pulled out of her Indian Wells semifinal match against Serena Williams at the last minute, claimingtendinitis; this occurrence garnered much speculation in the press, and some fans demanded their money back.[341][342][343]Indian Wells boycottAt the 2001 Ericsson Open the following week, Richard Williams stated that racist comments were made to him in the stands,[344]and the tournament director refused to offer Williams an apology for how he was treated.[citation needed]As a result, neither sister played the tournament even though it had become a mandatory stop on the WTA tour since 2009. In 2015, Williams decided to end her 14-year boycott and played.[345]2004 US OpenIn herUS Openquarterfinal match againstJennifer Capriati, an incorrect overrule was made by chair umpireMariana Alves; the video review showed that Williams's shot landed in bounds. In the same match, new technology being tested made incorrect line calls late in the third set. Williams argued with the chair over a couple of calls during the match, but was not successful. Capriati won the match, with Serena herself acknowledging that this was primarily due to her 57 unforced errors; nevertheless, she accused Alves of temporary insanity[346]and said that she "felt cheated".[347]In a post-match interview Capriati sharply observed that bad calls had gone against her in the past as well. Alves did not officiate for the remainder of the tournament; this was not punitive, as commonly thought, as she was not scheduled to officiate.[348]The controversy renewed calls for, and was widely given credit for, the adoption of technology such as theMacCAMandHawk-Eyesystems.[349]2009 US OpenIn theUS Opensemifinal round againstKim Clijsters, Williams slammed her racket on the court after losing the first set. She was given a warning, with a potential second violation carrying a one-point penalty. While trailing 4–6, 5–6, 15–30, Williams's second serve was called afoot fault, resulting in two match points for Clijsters. Williams gestured with her racket to the lineswoman who had made the call and yelled at her, with profanities and a threat to shove a tennis ball down the lineswoman's throat.[350]During the subsequent on-court conference between the chair umpire, the lineswoman, US Open officials, and Williams, a television microphone picked up Williams saying to the lineswoman, "I didn't say I would kill you! Are you serious?"[351]The incident resulted in Williams being penalized a point for unsportsmanlike conduct‍—‌necessitated by the earlier warning for racket abuse‍—‌meaning Clijsters won the match 6–4, 7–5. The following day, Williams was issued the maximum permissible on-site fine of $10,000 (plus $500 for racket abuse). After further investigation, the Grand Slam Committee in November 2009 fined her $175,000 in place of suspending her from the 2010 US Open or other Grand Slam events.[352]They also placed her on a two-year probation which provided that if Williams committed another offense at a Grand Slam event in the next two years, she would be suspended from participating in the following US Open. If, however, she committed no offenses within the next two years, her fine would be reduced to $82,500.[352]Williams initially refused to apologize for her outburst, both in her post-match press conference[353]and in an official statement released the following day.[124]She eventually did apologize, stating "I just really wanted to apologize sincerely because I'm a very prideful person, and I'm a very intense person and a very emotional person", and "I wanted to offer my sincere apologies to anyone that I may have offended." She said she was humbled by the experience.[354]2011 US OpenIn the final of the2011 US OpenagainstSamantha Stosur, Williams shouted "Come on!" as the Australian attempted to return aforehandWilliams believed to be a winner. The chair umpireEva Asderakiawarded the point to Stosur based on theITF's deliberate hindrance rule, which states, "If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if involuntary, the point shall be replayed."[355]As the point was 30–40 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur. Williams became angry with the chair umpire and made several gestures and unflattering comments toward her during the next changeover, including telling Asderaki that if the umpire ever saw Serena coming toward her, she should "look the other way".[356]Williams initially gained momentum in the set following the penalty, breaking back in the next game, but eventually flagged and lost the match, 2–6, 3–6. At the end of the match, she declined to offer the customary handshake to Asderaki.[357][358]Williams mentioned the incident in her post-match speech as the tournament runner-up, asserting, "I hit a winner, but I guess it didn't count", but added, "It wouldn't have mattered in the end. Sam played well."[359]A writer forESPNsuggested that Williams could avoid being found to have violated the terms of the "probation" on which she was placed following her 2009 outburst, as she did not appear to have usedprofanityin addressing Asderaki during the match.[360]In the end, Williams was fined $2,000 and was not barred from competing in the2012 US Openbecause "Williams' conduct, while verbally abusive, does not rise to the level of a major offense under the Grand Slam Code of Conduct."[361]2018 US OpenWilliams's2018 US Openended in controversy with Williams falling toNaomi Osakain straight sets following a game penalty in the second set of thefinal. During that second set, she was given a code violation because her coach,Patrick Mouratoglou, gave her coaching hand signals. Williams was upset by the violation, claiming that her coach was simply giving her a thumbs up, and demanded an apology from chair umpireCarlos Ramos. Mouratoglou later admitted that he was coaching.[362]She received a second violation for smashing her racket on the court, which resulted in a point penalty. After her third code violation for verbal abuse against the umpire, Williams was assessed a game penalty.[363][364]Williams said that she believed she was treated unfairly by the umpire because she is a woman.[365]Williams was fined a total of $17,000 including $4,000 for a coaching violation, $3,000 for racket abuse and $10,000 for verbal abuse towards the umpire.[366]Other issuesIn the beginning years of Williams' professional career, hair beads donned by the Williams sisters were the focus of discussion by commentators such as Chris Evert and John McEnroe, with Mary Carillo characterizing their hair as "noisy and disruptive".[367]The beads often broke and scattered across the court. Scholar Nancy E. Spencer said that commentary that dismissed the Williams' cultural hairstyles served to"other"the sisters, particularly in the context of a white dominated sport where their appearance and specifically their physicality is a popular topic for discussion.[367]Following the match controversy at the 2018 US Open final between Williams and Naomi Osaka, the Melbourne newspaper theHerald Sunpublished a cartoon byMark Knightdepicting Williams having a tantrum and breaking her racket while the umpire asks her opponent to "just let her win".[368]The cartoon was widely criticized as racist and sexist, including by Williams's husband, Reddit co-founderAlexis Ohanian, and authorJ. K. Rowling.[369][370]Complaints centered around the portrayal of Williams as an angry black woman with exaggerated large lips, a broad flat nose, and positioned in an ape-like pose, and the portrayal of Williams's opponent, Osaka, who is half-Japanese, half-Haitian, with blonde hair.[371]The editor of the Herald Sun argued the cartoon was unfairly criticized on social media.[372]Knight defended his work, saying that his satire was never about race or gender, but was about putting a spotlight on bad behavior by sporting superstars. In the immediate aftermath of the controversy he suspended his Twitter account to "protect his family and friends".[372]In September 2019, Romanian television host Radu Banciu made the following comments during a live broadcast: "Serena Williams looks exactly like one of those monkeys at the zoo with the red asses."[373]Romania'sNational Council for Combating Discriminationfined Banciu approximately $1,875 for his comments.LegacyWilliams is considered one of the best female tennis players of all time. In 2017,BBC Sportusers picked Williams as the greatest female tennis player of the Open Era. BBC presenter and former French Open Champion,Sue Barker, said "Serena is the greatest because this era is so much more competitive than previous eras. The pace she generates – her serve is without question the greatest ever – combined with her movement and her power, she pushes her opponents constantly on the back foot".[374]In 2018, a Tennis.com panel selected Serena as thegreatest female tennis player in the Open Era.[375]Some commentators, players and sports writers regard Williams as the greatest woman tennis player of all time.[b]In 2018,Federersaid the player who probably had the best case for tennis "Greatest Of All Time", man or woman, was Serena Williams.[377]In 2020, the Tennis Channel ranked Williams as the greatest woman tennis player of all time.[378]In 2022,John McEnroedescribed Williams as an "icon" and the "GOAT of GOATs".[379][380]Alongside her sisterVenus, Williams has been widely credited with increasing diversity within the sport:[381][382][383]It all starts with Venus and Serena. The demonstration effect. The power of seeing two African-American girls with braids in the finals of the biggest tournaments in the world in a predominantly white sport. Just a huge impact that really can't be overstated. That attracted thousands of girls into the sport, not just African-American but all backgrounds and races.

Williams responded by tweeting her displeasure, saying, "@TennysSandgren I don't need or want one. But there is an entire group of people that deserves an apology. I can't look at my daughter and tell her I sat back and was quiet. No! She will know how to stand up for herself and others – through my example." Additionally, she attached an image that read, "Maturity is being able to apologize and admit when you're wrong because you know that your mistakes don't define you".[438]Also in 2016, Serena Williams wrote an open letter in Porter Magazine's "Incredible Women of 2016" to speak out about gender equality and her personal struggles as a woman in tennis.[439]She noted that women's contributions to the sport of tennis are not recognized in the way men's contributions are recognized; she also called out issues of equal pay in tennis. She ended the letter stating that she hoped that her letter would inspire a new generation of women to "push for greatness and follow their dreams with steadfast resilience."[440]Williams received several awards for her activism, namely those directed towards Black communities.

The family included her parents—Oracene Price, a nurse, and Richard Williams, who founded a security service—andVenus Williams, her older sister. Price also had three daughters from a previous marriage. While both parents encouraged Serena and Venus Williams to play tennis, it was Richard Williams who largely taught them the sport, taking the two girls to the public courts in the area. He was known as a strict coach, and the sisters spent long hours practicing. In 1991 the family moved to Florida so that Serena and Venus Williams couldattenda tennis academy. Serena Williams turned professional in 1995, one year after her older sister. Possessing powerful serves and ground strokes and superb athleticism, they soon attracted much attention. Many predicted that Venus would be the first Williams sister to win a Grand Slam singles title, but it was Serena who accomplished the feat, winning the 1999 U.S. Open. At that tournament the sisters won the doubles event, and, over the course of their careers, the two teamed up for 14 Grand Slam doubles titles.Britannica QuizI Am the Greatest (Athlete)Serena Williams and Venus WilliamsSerena WilliamsAt the2000 Olympic Gamesin Sydney,Australia, Serena and Venus Williams won gold medals in the doubles event. After several years of inconsistent play, Serena Williamsassertedherself in 2002 and won theFrench Open,Wimbledon, and theU.S. Open, defeating Venus Williams in the finals of each tournament. At the latter tournament, Serena Williams also garnered attention by wearing a catsuit. Long interested in fashion, Williams became noted for bold outfits that highlighted her strength and challenged traditional—and typically conservative—dress codes. Displaying her trademark tenacity, Williams won theAustralian Openin 2003 and thus completed a career Grand Slam by having won all four of the slam’s component tournaments. Later that year she was also victorious at Wimbledon; both of her Grand Slam wins in 2003 came after she had bested her sister in the finals. In 2005 Williams won the Australian Open again. Beset by injury the following year, she rebounded in 2007 to win her third Australian Open. Serena and Venus Williams won their second doubles tennis gold medal at the2008 Olympic Gamesin Beijing. Later that year Serena Williams won the U.S. Open for a third time. In 2009 she captured her 10th Grand Slam singles title by winning the Australian Open. Later that year she won her third Wimbledon singles title, once again defeating her sister. Williams defended her titles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2010. She subsequently battled various health issues that kept her off the court for almost a year.Serena WilliamsIn 2012 Williams captured her fifth Wimbledon singles title. A month later at theLondon Olympic Games, she won a gold medal in the singles event, becoming the second woman (behindSteffi Graf) to win a career Golden Slam. She also teamed with her sister to win the doubles event. Later that year Williams claimed her 15th Grand Slam singles title with a victory at the U.S. Open. In 2013 she won her second French Open singles championship and fifth U.S. Open singles title. Williams successfully defended her U.S. Open championship in 2014, which gave her 18 career Grand Slam titles, tying her withChris EvertandMartina Navratilovafor the second highest women’s singles total of the open era. The following year she captured her sixth Australian Open. Williams then won the 2015 French Open—her 20th total Grand Slam singles championship. She continued hertorridstreak at Wimbledon, winning a straight-set final to capture her sixth career Wimbledon singles title. Williams again won Wimbledon in 2016, giving her 22 career Grand Slam singles titles, which tied her with Graf for the most Slams in the open era for both women and men. Williams broke Graf’s record at the 2017 Australian Open, where she defeated her sister in the final.Serena Williams and her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr.In April 2017, Williams announced that she was pregnant (she had gotten engaged to Alexis Ohanian, cofounder of the website Reddit, in December 2016) and would miss the remainder of the 2017 season. In September she gave birth to a daughter, and two months later she married Ohanian. Williams returned to tennis in March 2018. She failed to win a tournament that year, though she reached the finals at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. The latter loss proved controversial as Williams was penalized a game after arguing with the chair umpire over a code violation. In 2019 she was again defeated in the finals at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. At the 2020 ASB Classic in Auckland,New Zealand, Williams won her first singles event in some three years.Williams reached the semifinals of the 2021 Australian Open but lost toNaomi Osaka. Later that year she was forced towithdrawfrom both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open because of injuries. After missing the first half of the 2022 season, Williams competed at Wimbledon but was defeated in the first round. She later wasinterviewed forVoguemagazineand revealed that she would be retiring after the upcoming U.S. Open. Williams stated that she was “evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.”Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.Subscribe NowWilliams’s activities outside of tennis include ventures relating to fashion, beauty, and accessories.

With 23 Grand Slam titles, Williams rose from the public courts of Compton, California to shatter records and dominate the field.Serena Jameka Williams was born to parents Richard Williams and Oracene Price on September 26, 1981 in Saginaw, Michigan. Williams is the youngest of Price's five daughters, who include fellow tennis superstar Venus Williams. Richard Williams, a former sharecropper from Louisiana, was determined that daughters Serena and Venus would succeed in life. Seeing opportunity in tennis, he and Oracene taught themselves the game from books and videos so that they could coach their children. Richard moved the family to Compton, California, where Williams began intensive tennis training with her father and older sister around the age of three. The Williams sisters practiced for hours every day on rundown public tennis courts.Williams joined the junior United States Tennis Association tour and by 1991 she ranked first in the 10-and-under division. Richard then moved the family to Palm Beach, Florida, where the sisters trained with coach Rick Macci. Richard kept Williams and her sister from competing in the junior tournaments, hoping to ensure that they would not burn out before turning professional.In 1995, at the age of 14, Williams made her professional debut at a qualifying event in Quebec City. Fellow American Annie Miller defeated her soundly. Williams did not play another professional match until 1997, but by the end of that year she rose to number 99 in the world rankings. In 1998, Williams’s ranking rose to number 20 and she surpassed Monica Seles to become the fastest player to record five victories against Top 10 players.Williams graduated from Driftwood Academy in 1999 and soon after signed a $12 million endorsement deal with Puma. She won her first Grand Slam title that year, when she defeated Martina Hingis 6-3, 7–6 to win the U.S. Open, and rose to number four in the world rankings. Two years later, Williams lost to her sister in the U.S. Open final – it was the first time that sisters played against each other in a Grand Slam final since 1884.The African-American Williams and her sister made an immediate impact in the predominately white tennis world: their strength and athleticism on the court overmatched many opponents and their colorful, fashionable styles garnered media attention. The Williams sisters are credited with ushering in the power era of women’s tennis, characterized by blindingly-fast serves and commanding groundstrokes. They competed together as doubles partners, eventually winning 14 Grand Slam doubles titles. They took gold at the 2000, 2008, and 2012 Olympics and are the winningest doubles tennis team in Olympic history.In 2001, Williams won California’s Indian Wells tournament for the second time. Williams, along with her father and sister who were watching in the stands, claimed spectators hurled racial slurs their way while booing them. Williams later described the racist treatment as traumatizing and she boycotted the tournament until 2015.Williams continued to amass victories and rise in the rankings. In 2002, she won her second, third, and fourth Grand Slam titles at Roland-Garros (the French Open), Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open, respectively. In each of those tournaments, she defeated her sister Venus in the final match. On July 8, 2002 she reached the ranking of number one in the world, a position she held for 57 straight weeks. In 2003, Williams won her first Australian Open, becoming one of only six women in the Open Era (post-1968) to complete a career Grand Slam (in which a player wins all four major championships). Williams actually held all four titles at once, an accomplishment she dubbed “The Serena Slam.”However, 2003 also brought troubles for Williams. She underwent knee surgery in August and in September her older sister, Yetunde Price, was murdered in Los Angeles. The loss of her sister was difficult for Williams. She came back from the knee injury in the 2004 season, but other injuries plagued her for the next three years. She won the Australian Open in 2005 and 2007, but her injuries and losses resulted in her ranking dropping to number 139.In 2008, Williams began her return to championship form by winning the U.S. Open. The following year, she won the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and reclaimed her number one world ranking. Her five-year gap between number one rankings is the longest of any player ever. Williams cited her faith as a Jehovah’s Witness as well as an inspirational trip to West Africa for restoring her competitive spirit. In 2009, she faced fines and probation after an altercation with a referee at the U.S. Open, but the following year Williams added two more Grand Slam titles and finished the season ranked number four.Williams suffered from a blood clot in her lung in 2011, but returned to dominance later that year. In 2012, Williams earned a gold medal for singles’ tennis at the London Olympic Games. The 2013-2015 seasons marked her third, fourth, and fifth number-one seasons, after which she had won her 21stGrand Slam championship and completed her second Serena Slam.In 2017, Williams won the Australian Open. It was her 23rdGrand Slam title, meaning she surpassed Steffi Graf’s record for Grand Slam singles’ titles in the Open Era. A few months later, she revealed she was expecting her first child and had been pregnant when she won the Australian Open. That September, Williams gave birth to her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr., and married Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian shortly after. Williams experienced a difficult childbirth: she had an emergency cesarean section and suffered from another blood clot and other severe complications. By telling her story publicly, Williams contributed to a growing national dialogue about the disproportionately high number of Black women that suffer from pregnancy and postpartum complications.Williams returned to tennis in 2018, ranked number 549. The attention Williams brought to the issue of rankings after giving birth led the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) to take action. The WTA’s new rule allowed players who leave the sport for childbirth or injury to use their previous rankings to enter up to 12 tournaments within three years of their return. Williams, whose career winnings exceed $90 million, also advocates for female tennis players regarding equitable prize money.Outside of tennis, Williams has been busy as well. She realized her fashion design dreams when she released her clothing line (“S by Serena”) in 2018 as well as a jewelry line in 2019. She serves as a UNICEF International Goodwill Ambassador; has opened two secondary schools in Kenya; and sits on the board of the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative. She has her own venture capital firm, Serena Ventures, that invests in technology companies owned or led by women and African Americans.Williams was named the AP Female Athlete of the Decade for her dominance in the 2010s. She continues to inspire tennis hopefuls and the wider public through her hard work and pursuit of excellence on and off the court.Works CitedAllen, JA. “The Williams Sisters and the Rise of the Women's Power Game.” Bleacher Report.

To celebrate the launch ofAway’s latest collaboration with the grand-slam champ, we asked Williams to share the top four places she’s dreaming of returning to once travel is back—and what makes each of them irreplaceable in her eyes.For Serena Williams, the work is never done→Miami: The quintessential city for beachgoers, art lovers, all-night partiers, and sports superstars alike. Photo byZarpe 77.1. Miami, FloridaWhat made you fall in love with Miami?Miami has something for everyone. Between the amazing art scene, the food, the culture, and a wide range of sporting events (let’s go, Miami Dolphins!), you can never run out of things to do. It just has such a beautiful vibrance to it. I’ve made so many amazing memories in Miami, and I cannot wait to make many more.What’s your first (or favorite) memory of Miami?TheS by Serena pop-up shops at Art Baselor my bridal shower at1 Hotel South Beach.What restaurants or meals from Miami do you crave most?NOBU. I love Japanese food, and once you have NOBU, there’s no turning back. I’ve been to a lot of different NOBU locations over the years, but the one in Miami is one of my favorites. It’s part of theEden Roc Hotel, and between the food, views, atmosphere, service, and overall glamour, it’s an experience I always look forward to.[Otherwise,] I don’t necessarily have a go-to restaurant because I’d rather explore as much of the city as possible. You can truly go anywhere in Miami and find a fun atmosphere and delicious food and drinks. That’s part of why I love the city. There’s an adventure around every corner.Where to explore Miami’s cutting-edge art scene year-round→Although she currently lives in Florida, Williams is a California girl through and through. Photo byPhotoholgic.2. San Francisco, CaliforniaWhat made you fall in love with San Francisco?To me, San Francisco feels like a small town. It’s beautiful and big, but when you’re there, you feel like a part of the community. I’ve always been attracted to it, and I envision myself settling down there and just being a mom.What’s your first (or favorite) memory of San Francisco?One day I took a trip to Dolores Park, and while I was out exploring the area with [my husband] Alexis, I saw these two random guys playing tennis. I literally dropped everything to play with them, and I had such a blast doing it. I think they were pretty surprised.What restaurants or meals from San Francisco do you crave most?Mission Chinese. I love Asian cuisine, and Mission’s menu is creative and unique while still having the classics that everyone enjoys. Everything I’ve ordered is delicious. Plus, the atmosphere in the restaurant is perfect for a lowkey date night. It has almost a dive-bar feel with a five-star menu. Plus, they deliver, which is always a perk.[I also love] any Mexican food restaurant or donuts from San Francisco. I know those two sound unrelated, but this city has such a great range of options no matter what you are craving.San Francisco’s most beautiful restaurants→Along with being a tennis champion, Williams is also a polyglot: she speaks English, French, and Italian. Photo byIan Kelsall.3. Paris, FranceWhat made you fall in love with Paris?I lived there for a few years. I learned French and had the opportunity to experience the beautiful European culture.What’s your first (or favorite) memory of Paris?Shopping at Rue Saint-Honoré in Paris. Great street with the best boutiques.What restaurants or meals from Paris do you crave most?APICIUS—it’s gorgeous. From the moment you approach the building, the elegance is obvious. It used to be a chateau and was built in1860. You just feel like royalty there, and I love to bring my friends whenever I can.It’s glamorous, the food is delicious, and you feel like you’ve been teleported into a fairy tale whenever you’re there. Cinderella and Belle would definitely hang out there.And coffee. I’m not sure if it’s the actual coffee or just the overall vibe of being at a cute local cafe, but I love it. I could people-watch for hours at Paris cafes, and having a yummy fresh pastry to go along with it makes it even better.The ultimate guide to Paris’s 10th arrondissement→As the city where she met her lifelong partner, Rome will forever have Williams' heart.

Serena Williams' Go-To Vacations Are All In Her Head These DaysMenu(Living Well With)Serena Williams' Go-To Vacations Are All In Her Head These DaysThe 5-Minute Wellness Habit Serena Williams Does Every Single DaybyAngela MeleroFeb. 2, 2021Although she's been jet-setting around the world as a professional tennis player since she was a teenager, these days,Serena Williams' favorite getawaysare all in her head — literally. "My daughter and I love to use our imaginations to go anywhere we want from the comfort and safety of our backyard," says Williams to TZR via email. "The zoo has become our new favorite place 'to go.'"Yes, if you ever want to join the 39-year-old pro-athlete and 3-year-old Alexis Olympia Ohanian on one of their adventures, just scroll through Williams' Instagram feed. From mommy-and-meDisney Princess dress-up sessionstohigh-energy tennis matches, this dynamic duo is truly a sight to see. In fact, Williams' latest campaign withtravel company Awaywas inspired by some of the make-believe vacations she's taken with her daughter and husband (Alexis Ohanian) this past year. "We had a lot of fun with this idea when doing the photo shoot for this collection," says Williams. "We really playfully recreated some of my favorite cities using backdrops, props, and even a kiddie pool. While stuck at home, it’s been really fun to get creative and figure out new ways to satisfy our wanderlust."That's not to say Williams isn't looking forward to hitting the road again with her family in tow. The new collaboration with Away — the athlete's second with the brand — is inspired by her own family-centric travel needs. "I wanted to create a collection that spoke to traveling as a family, since it's one of the most important things to me," says Williams. "This collection includes a Kid’s Carry-On, a Pet Carrier, as well as a full line of luggage and travel accessories. [...] Like many people, I’ve been dreaming of the world opening back up, and this collection is already inspiring me toplan some new adventureswhen it’s safe."In the meantime, it's imaginary zoo trips, Disney sing-alongs, and baking parties with Olympia for this 23-time Grand Slam  tennis champion.  And she'd have it no other way: "This time has really allowed us to connect and play together, so I am very grateful."Ahead, Williams gives TZR the rundown on what gets — and keeps — her — moving right now.

I also love the Pet Carrier in this collection, especially since I always travel with my dog, Chip.What new concerns or priorities do you have when traveling now that you didn’t have maybe five or six years ago?Over the years, I’ve been able to create a system for packing that keeps me less stressed while traveling, especially when I’m packing for the whole family. I start laying things out at least a week in advance and use Away’s packing cubes to stay organized and keep track of all my ‘must pack’ essentials.Away X Serena WilliamsThe Bigger Carry-On$245See On AwayAway X Serena WilliamsThe Pet Carrier$225See on AwayAway X Serena WilliamsThe Kids' Carry-On$195Away X Serena WilliamsThe Expandable Packing Cubes$55See On AwayHow much are you traveling these days?Very rarely!
