I wish there was a way to get nutrients without sitting down for a meal. As the main staples Elon s diet consisted of hot dogs oranges pasta and green peppers. Because I have a great deal of respect for Elon and his ability to create I wanted to see if I could complete his challenge of living on one dollar a day.To be as accurate as possible I researched the inflation rate from when Elon was 17 years old until now.It turns out one dollar in 1989 would be the equivalent of about 2.20 today. I decided to round up to two dollars a day for this challenge to see if I could do it.My regular diet compared to Elon s dietMy usual routine consists of three meals a day. I usually have a breakfast bar and coffee in the morning.Lunch is made with either chicken or steak for protein complimented with grains and a mixed salad. Dinner also involves animal protein and a couple of vegetable sides.Needless to say mynormal dietis much more than 2 per day so I knew it would be a challenge to restrict my spending by that much. At two dollars per day I would need to feed myself for seven days for 14.00 or less.My breakfast for a weekI am perfectly content eating the same thing every day so I planned my week ahead of time.I bought 18 eggs for 2.00 and ate two each morning 0.29 per morning for seven days .I also purchased a five pound bag of brown rice for 3.38. I split this into seven servings 0.48 per serving and ate one serving for breakfast.The total cost of breakfast for the week 5.38My lunch for a weekFor lunch I made Rotini pasta. I purchased two boxes of Walmart brand Garden Rotini in the 16 ounce box for 1.00 each.I split the 32 ounces into seven servings for lunch 0.28 per day . I also purchased generic 24 ounce pasta sauce for 1.50 and split it over my lunch pasta 0.21 per day .For a side I purchased a three pound bag of mandarin oranges for 3.00 and split them evenly into 14 sides. I used them for lunch and dinner 0.21 per day .The total cost of lunch for the week 4.90My dinner for a weekI went with the eight pack of Bar S jumbo hot dogs for 1.16. I also purchased an eight pack of whole wheat hot dog buns for 0.87.I did cheat here because I did not have enough money for ketchup so I used some I already had in the refrigerator.I ate the mandarin oranges as a dinner side which equaled 0.21 each night.The total cost of dinner for the week 3.50My total cost of food for the week After adding it all up I spent a total of 13.87 on food for the week. I was able to do it for less than my goal of 14.00 but only by 0.13.How Elon Musk s diet made me feelBefore I started the Elon Musk challenge I drank one cup of coffee each day. When I started the diet I could not afford coffee so I was forced to drink only water for the week.This led to serious caffeine withdrawal headaches for the first three days. I was not expecting to have to deal with headaches which were more difficult than I envisioned.Lack of energyBefore going on Elon s diet I ate three large meals a day and was rarely hungry. However after a week on Elon Musk s diet I found I was drained and hungry most of the time.I assume it was mostly due to the large decrease in my caloric intake. My body was accustomed to eating 2 500 calories a day and the Elon Musk diet decreased my calories to around 1 000 1 500.Weight lossOne benefit of this diet was the fact I lost two pounds. Unfortunately it was not a healthy way to lose weight since it felt like I was starving myself.While I was able to complete his diet challenge I found that myhealth suffereddue to eating low quality food and not enough calories.Elon Musk s diet todayElon has come a long way since his diet challenge in 1989. His normal routine today consists of coffee in the morning and a small lunch he can eat in five minutes or less.His dinner choices usually involve one of his favorite dishes which include French cuisine or American barbeque.Elon no longer watches what he eats and onlyexercisesone to two times a week. For a man who is so busy it seems like food still gets in the way of his progress.More DietElon MuskExerciseHow ToMorning RoutineSuccessful HabitsLadders PressMore from LaddersThe simple eye contact trick you should use in every conversation I got a job with Apply4Me Be a good boss to yourself 2023Ladders Inc.ProductsJob SearchLadders RecruiterExpert NetworkHighest Paying JobsHighest Paying CompaniesHighest Paying CareersHighest Paying IndustriesCities StatesRemote JobsHelpCareer AdviceFAQSMember HelpRecruiter HelpContact UsUnsubscribeAbout LaddersCompanyEditorial TeamLadders EstimatesPress MediaPrivacyTerms of UseEditorial PolicyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationSite MapWork at Ladders

What is Elon Musk s Favorite Food No ResultView All ResultNo ResultView All ResultHomeElon MuskWhat is Elon Musk s Favorite Food byBetty Jackson2020 10 06Elon Musk has come a long way since he fed himself on 1 a day and mostly ate oranges and hot dogs. These days he can afford anything he wants to eat. So what would he choose What is Elon Musk s favorite food French food and BBQ. While these are more preparations then particular foods this is his answer when asked the question. The two almost seem at odds with one another as they re kind of at the opposite ends of the preparation stratosphere.While Musk may have given up on oranges and hot dogs one thing he can t give up on is sweets. Many times he s chosen to have aMars bar for breakfast instead of a proper breakfast. As someone who travels around the world for business he has tasted a lot of cuisine.Musk s Eating HabitsElon Musk doesn t really stick to a particular diet. Or really watch what he eats at all. Often times during the day someone will bring him food for lunch and he ll just eat whatever is put in front of him.While he eats Mars bars for breakfast he s not averse to cereal he just prefers it in the middle of the night.Cinnamon Toast Crunchis his favorite to chow down on.How Tall Is Elon Musk Exact Height RevealedDid Elon Musk Grow Up Rich How Did Grimes And Elon Musk Meet In addition to giving up the 1 a day eating diet he s also reduced his caffeine intake previously driving large amounts ofDiet Coke and coffee. He still continues to drink both just a more manageable level of about 3 each a day. Which would still be a lot for some people. Though if I worked as much as Elon Musk did I d probably drink the same amount.Ice cream sundae in a martini glasspic.twitter.com zAVFlOsYkM Elon Musk elonmusk May 13 2020A Family s Lack of InfluenceElon s younger brother Kimbal is almost the complete opposite of him when it comes to food. The brothers have a lot in common when it comes to business as they joined forces to start their first business and have continued to be partners since.Kimbal has less of a visual role in Tesla and SpaceX though sits on the boards of each. He is a professionally trained chef that owns multiple restaurants and eateries. His big focuses are on sustainability and providing access to fresh food to all of America no matter where they are or their circumstance.While not a vegan himself he does have a vegan restaurant and promotes healthy eating. The majority of his fuel comes from vegetables and fish. A stark contrast to his older brother. Elon has helped Kimbal with his initiatives but little brother hasn t been able to influence him to eat a healthier diet.In addition to his brother s healthy eating ways his mother s eating is healthy as well. Supermodel Maye Musk is also a registered dietician and has helped many patients while she was providing for her three children. Again no luck with convincing Elon that perhaps so much junk food isn t good.The Boring Company CandyNot sure if this is actually true or not but Musk talked about it on dates other than April 1st so perhaps there s some validity to it. And thatitis that he s looking tostart a candybrand and or store.I m starting a candy company it s going to be amazing Elon Musk elonmusk May 5 2018He says he s serious and showed a picture of thefirst prototypeon his now deleted Instagram. I wonder what candy created by Elon Musk would taste like. He has said that he would like a cryptocandy but I have no idea what that means or what it would taste like. All I can think of is freeze dried astronaut food.French and BarbequeThough he answered that French and Barbeque are his favorite foods he mostly only talks about junk food so we re not sure if he just gave the answer as it sounded better than ice cream. One thing we know for sure that s not at the top of his list are oranges and hot dogs.AboutCelebrity Name List A Z ContactPrivacy PolicyAdvertise 2020 Black Sands Media All Rights ReservedNo ResultView All ResultHomeAboutCelebrity ListContactAdvertiseOur SitesLuxuryViewerHistoryAnswers 2020 Black Sands Media All Rights Reserved

His success as a serial entrepreneur though follows an eventful childhood in which a young Musk played with homemade rockets coded his own video games and endured hardships both at school and home.Here are eight things you might not know about Musk s youth.1. He went door to door selling candy to rich peopleWhile growing up in Pretoria Musk his brother Kimbal and their cousins traveled around the wealthy parts of the South African capital selling homemade chocolate Easter eggs.The adventurous group traveled door to door selling the sweets for 20 times the cost of making them.VIDEO1 0201 02Elon Musk s brother says this is how you raise entrepreneurial kidsMake It Voices I d make them for 50 cents and charge 10 for an Easter egg and I d always get this question like Why are you charging 10 for this little Easter egg said Kimbalto CNBC Make It in a 2017 interview. And I was like Well you re supporting a young capitalist. And the reality is if you don t buy it from me you re not going to get one and I know you can afford 10. 2. He was bulliedMusk has been open about his difficult childhood discussing it most recently in last Sunday s 60 Minutes interview. While he attended grade school in Pretoria South Africa Musk was not only theyoungest and smallest kid in his class but he was nerdier and muchmore into booksthan manyjocks at school.In Ashlee Vance s 2015 book Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future Musk said gangs of boys at would sometimes hunt him down going so far as to push him down a flight of stairs in one instance and send him to the hospital. I was almost beaten to death he addedon 60 Minutes. The bullying continueduntil he was 15 years old when went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself by doing karate judo and wrestling. By 16 he said he was dishing it out as hard as they d give it to me. 3. His parents thought he was deafMusk was so introspective as a kid that his parents and doctors ordered tests to check if he was deaf. His mother Maye Musk eventually learned this was his way of daydreaming about his inventions. He goes into his brain and then you just see he is in another world. He still does that. Now I just leave him be because I know he is designing a new rocket or something recalled Maye Musk in Vance s book.Though this bothered his peers who could reportedly yell at him and do jumping jacks beside him and he wouldn t notice Musk s pensive moments allowed him to visualize projects he d hope to tackle.4. He made his own explosives and rocketsWhile his parents were away Musk lived mostly under the watch of a housekeeper. According to Musk she was mainly there to make sure he didn t break anything.VIDEO1 5701 57The one trait that Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have in commonThe Definitive Guide to Business She wasn t like watching me. I was off making explosives and reading books and building rockets and doing things that could have gotten me killed said Musk. I m shocked that I have all my fingers. 5. He had a penchant for readingThroughout his childhood books played a crucial role in fueling Musk s ambitions and entertaining him.Said Musk I was raised by books. Books and then my parents. He reportedly read the entire Encyclopedia Britannicaat age nineand would pore over science fiction novels comics and nonfiction books for up to 10 hours a day. Some of themost influential books he readincluded The Lord of the Rings The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and Isaac Asimov s Foundation series.6. He coded his own video game at 12 and got 500 for itIn the early days of computer coding a 12 year old Musk built a Blastar a science fiction inspired space game. Similar to the classic Space Invaders arcade game the objective in Blastar was to destroy an alien spacecraft carrying deadly bombs.Although he s since called it atrivial game Blastar earned Musk an easy 500 after a South African trade publication published its source code.7. He was master at Dungeons DragonsAlong with his cousins Musk loved playing the fantasy role playing game. One time the teens went to Johannesburg for a Dungeons Dragons tournament. That was us being nerd masters supremes Musk told Vance.VIDEO1 2901 29Ex Google exec 3 traits that make Elon Musk an exceptional leader and one major flawThe Definitive Guide to BusinessAccording to his cousin Peter Rive Musk helped their team win the tournament with his incredible imagination and ability to keep people captivated and inspired. 8. He tried opening his own video arcade at 16Along with his younger cousins and Kimbal Muskgot the idea to open an arcadeby their high school according to Vance s book. They got as far as signing a lease setting contracts together filling out forms at the city planning department. But their plans were foiled when the city told them they were too young to get a real estate permit without an adult to sign off.According to Kimbal both his father and uncle flipped out when they brought up their arcade plans.9. He moved to North America as a teenagerOnce Elon reached his teens he moved from his native South Africa tobegin his college studiesin North America. At 17 he first emigrated to see what it takes to live he told Neil DeGrasse Tysonon StarTalk Radio. Musk found that in America it s pretty easy to keep yourself alive. Given that his threshold for existing was pretty low Musk was determined to survive on 1 a day by buying food at the supermarket in bulk. I went more for the hotdogs and oranges you do get really tired of hot dogs and oranges after a while said Musk. mixing things up every now and then with some pasta and green pepper and a big thing of sauce which he said could go pretty far too.

Elon Musk Recommends 12 Books that Changed his LifeSkip to main contentSkip to header right navigationSkip to site footerFarnam StreetMastering the best of what other people have already figured outHeader SearchSearch siteSubmit searchMenuArticlesNewsletterPodcastBooksCoursesSearchSearch siteSubmit searchLog InBecome a MemberTweetEmailLinkedInPrintBook Recommendations Reading Time 3minutesElon Musk Recommends 12 Books that Changed his LifeThe best thing about Elon Musk is that he makes us dream big again. Musk of course is the billionaire and brilliant mind behind Tesla and SpaceX.Charlie Mungerwas asked a question about him at the 2014 Daily Journal Meeting and he replied I think Elon Musk is a genius and I don t use that word lightly. I think he s also one of the boldest men that ever came down the pike.In fact after meeting Musk people tend to walk away with the same reaction He s the smartest guy I ve ever met. Whenever anyone asks him how he learned to build rockets he says I read books. Not only does he read them according to hisinterview with Esquire he devours them. Musk takes us into his personal library and offers some recommendations of his own.In an interview withDesign and Architecture Musk said In terms of sci fi books I think Isaac Asimov is really great. I like theFoundation series probably one of the all time best. Robert Heinlein obviously. I likeThe Moon Is a Harsh Mistressand I likeStranger in a Strange Land although it kind of goes off the rails at the end. He continues There s a good book on structural design calledStructures Or Why Things Don t Fall Down. It is really really good if you want a primer on structural design. Here are some of his other reading recommendations.The Lord of the Ringsby J.R.R. Tolkien. He toldthe New Yorkerthat as an undersized and picked upon smart aleck he turned to reading fantasy and science fiction. The heroes of the books I read The Lord of the Rings and the Foundation series always felt a duty to save the world. Benjamin Franklin An American Lifeby Walter Isaacson. He was an entrepreneur Musk says inan interview. He started from nothing. He was just a runaway kid. In that same interview he also recommendsEinstein His Life and Universe also by Isaacson.Zero to One Notes on Startups or How to Build the Futureby Peter Thiel I ve already said this is required reading for Farnam Streeters. On this book Musk says Peter Thiel has built multiple breakthrough companies and this book shows how. Superintelligence Paths Dangers Strategiesby Nick Bostrom. Worth reading Superintelligence by Bostrom. We need to be super careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes. Musk tweeted. Of course I bought this.Howard Hughes His Life and Madnessby Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele.Recently inan interview with CNN he mentioned having just finished this book. Musk calls it a cautionary tale. The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxyby Douglas Adams. Here is an excerpt froman interviewwhere he explains why this was a key book for him Alison van Diggelen I understand Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy that wonderful book by Douglas Adams that was a key book for you. What was it about that book that fired your imagination Elon Musk I guess when I was around 12 or 15 I had an existential crisis and I was reading various books on trying to figure out the meaning of life and what does it all mean It all seemed quite meaningless and then we happened to have some books by Nietzsche and Schopenhauer in the house which you should not read at age 14 laughter . It is bad it s really negative. So then I read Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy which is quite positive I think and it highlighted an important point which is that a lot of times the question is harder than the answer. And if you can properly phrase the question then the answer is the easy part. So to the degree that we can better understand the universe then we can better know what questions to ask. Then whatever the question is that most approximates what s the meaning of life That s the question we can ultimately get closer to understanding. And so I thought to the degree that we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness and knowledge then that would be a good thing. Finally we get to the rocket science part.Ignition An informal history of liquid rocket propellantsby John D. Clark. There is a good book on rocket stuff called Ignition by John Clark that s a really fun one Musk said inan interview. Becoming a rocket scientist isn t cheap. This book recommendation from Musk will set you back about 3k for a used copy it s alsofree on the web Additional Sources Business Insiderandfavobooks Read NextNext Post Charles Dickens to The Times I Stand Astounded and AppalledOn November 13 1849 a crowd of over 30 000 people gathered outside a prison in South London to witness the public execution of Marie and Discover What You re MissingGet the weekly email full of actionable ideas and insights you can use at work and home.As seen on 2023 Farnam Street Media Inc.

It s said that he read the entire Encyclopedia Britannicaat age nineand would pore through science fiction novels for more than 10 hours a day.When asked how he learned about rockets Musk reportedlysaid I read books. His voracious reading habit was essential to launching his history making career.Here are eight books that shaped the revolutionary entrepreneur 1. Structures Or Why Things Don t Fall Down by J.E. GordonWhen Musk decided he wanted to learn rocket science he studied textbooks on astrophysics and engineering. While reading advanced texts on physics may not be for everyone this book offers a lighter take on the science behind SpaceX. It is really really good if you want a primer on structural design Musksays in an interview with KCRW.2. Benjamin Franklin An American Life by Walter IsaacsonBen Franklin author inventor scientist and diplomat is one of Musk sheroes. You can see how Franklin was an entrepreneur Musk says in an interview with Foundation s Kevin Rose. He was an entrepreneur. He started from nothing. He was just a runaway kid. 3. Einstein His Life and Universe by Walter IsaacsonMusktells Rosehe was influenced by the biography of theoretical physicist Albert Einstein and it s clear why.Some of Einstein s most famous quotes like The important thing is not to stop questioning and Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new speak directly to Musk s vision for his companies.4. Superintelligence Paths Dangers Strategies by Nick BostromThough Musk is a futurist and deeply interested in artificial intelligence he has shared his worries about potential dangers and ethical concerns associated with the technology.Bostrom s book which deals with the potential challenges presented should computational intelligence surpass human intelligence is worth reading Musk tweeted in 2014.5. Merchants of Doubt by Erik M. Conway and Naomi OreskesMusk recommends this argument by two historians who believe that scientists with political and corporate connections have purposefully muddied the facts around many public health issues such as the negative effects of smoking. He posted his recommendation on Twitter in 2013.6. Lord of the Flies by William GoldingThis classic novel on survival competition and greed left its mark on the tech entrepreneur. The heroes of the books I read always felt a duty to save the world he tellsthe New Yorker.7. Zero to One Notes on Startups or How to Build the Future by Peter ThielThe book based on notes from a popular class Thiel taught at Stanford University in 2012 focuses on the need for unique thinking among would be startup founders. Musksaysthat his Paypal co founder s book offers an interesting exploration of the process of building super successful companies.8. The Foundation trilogy by Isaac AsimovIn a 2013 interview withThe Guardian Musk says Asimov s books taught him that civilizations move in cycles a lesson that encouraged the entrepreneur to pursue his radical ambitions. Given that this is the first time in 4.5 billion years where it s been possible for humanity to extend life beyond Earth he says it seems like we d be wise to act while the window was open and not count on the fact it will be open a long time.

It didn t matter what position they were interviewing for he wanted to talk to everyone. According tohis biography many of those who sat across from Musk would be asked his favorite brain teaser interview question You re standing on the surface of the earth. You walk one mile south one mile west and one mile north. You end up exactly where you started. Where are you How to answer Elon Musk s interview questionIf you re scratching your head at this brain teaser you re not alone. Apparently engineers usually solved the problem and guessed the correct answer the North Pole. Following Musk s directions and using the North Pole as the start location you d make a triangle and end up right where you began. Another potential answer could be the South Pole.The good news Musk wasn t too concerned with job candidates giving him the right answer. When interviewers ask brain teaser questions like this one they re looking to gauge the candidate s critical thinking skills and ability to operate under pressure not necessarily for the correct answer. Interviewers use these questions to see if you can think and resolve issues quickly with what data they present TopInteview coach Nick D.says. The answer is often irrelevant. It s the candidate s way of coming to the conclusion that matters. What to do if you don t know the answer to the questionLet s say an interviewer asks you a question like this and you re totally baffled. What do you do First don t panic. Remember interviewers aren t necessarily looking for the correct answer. They just want to get a better idea of the way you process information and solve problems. Second don t try to avoid the question. Don t try to talk around a question or pretend you have some expertise when you don t Nick says. An employer wants to know you are honest and have integrity. If you are insincere or lie bye bye. If you need feel free to ask follow up questions to clarify what the interviewer is asking. This will show them you re curious and give them a glimpse into how you solve problems. Then even if you re not sure about the answer start talking through your thought process. Break the problem down explain your assumptions and map out exactly how you d arrive at your answer whatever it ends up being.Types of brain teaser interview questionsWhen it comes to preparing for brain teasers it helps to understand that these types of questions are typically grouped into two categories process and creative.Elon Musk asked his candidates a process question which is popular for engineering positions. The question likely won t have an obvious answer and the candidate will need to talk it through with a step by step analysis.Here s another example of a process focused brain teaser question There s a school bus parked outside. Approximately how many golf balls would fit inside it Again you probably can t tell the interviewer exactly how many golf balls can fit into a school bus but Nick offered up an example of how you could respond I would calculate or look up the volume of the interior bus space subtract the volume occupied by the seats take the volume of a standard gold ball and divide one into the other to acquire an estimate for the number of golf balls that could fit. There are also creative brain teasers to consider. An example of a creative brain teaser question is If you were an African animal which one would you be and why With this question there really isn t a correct answer. An interviewer simply wants to get to know you better and get a glimpse into the way you think.Nick offered an example of how you could answer that question I would be a male lion as they are instinctive leaders who support their pride. They ensure each member is successful safe and has what they need to survive. They re focused on the growth and well being of the group nevermind they sleep 18 plus hours a day and only wake up to eat and play. How to prepare for brain teaser interview questionsLike your classicbehavioral interview questions the best way to prepare for brain teaser or riddle questions is to practice. You can find lists of these types of interview questions online so take some time to answer a handful of them talking through your thought process asking clarifying questions and explaining exactly how you d arrive at your answer even if you don t know the answer off the top of your head.Also remember to stay calm take a deep breath and don t try to wiggle your way out of the question. The interviewer simply wants to better understand the way you operate and process information so don t shy away from letting them know.Want to practice answering these types of interview questions with a professional interview coach TopInterview s experts can help Connect with a coach today.Recommended Reading What s a Stress Interview And How to Prepare For OneBeware These Interview Questions Are Trickier Than They Appear7 Times an Interview Coach Is Definitely Worth ItRelated Articles How to Prepare for a Software Engineering Job Interview7 Common Interview Questions for an Executive Director and How to Answer Them10 Adaptability Interview Questions and AnswersSearchSearchNeed a prep talk Learn how to crush your interview with confidence.Get started Share this article SearchQuestions We can help.Our team is standing by happy to help answer any questions or address any concerns you may have.

And when the American Society of Mechanical EngineersprofiledElon Musk they noted While Mr. Musk does not have an engineering degree per say he holds degrees in Physics and Economics from the University of Pennsylvania few dispute his assertion in response to his focus on technical details as CEO of Tesla and Space X I m an engineer so what I do is engineering. That s what I m good at. Clearly Musk likes engineering. But do engineers like Musk It appears so.When considering their dream job undergrad engineering students love Elon Musk s high profile companies Tesla Motors and SpaceX. Take a look at the top five ideal employers that engineering students voted for in a recent survey by Universum.Elon Musk s Tesla Motors and SpaceX both ranked in the elite top five dream jobs for engineering students out of 230 companies.It s no wonder Musk has always been vocal about the importance of engineering and his admiration for engineers.So can Elon Musk really attract top engineering talent to Tesla Forbes reported that Universum head of research and insights for the Americas Kevin Troy noted that they engineering students are leaning away from more traditional employers and pursuing careers at companies like Tesla. In addition he explained Space software and engineering companies both new guard engineering companies like Tesla and traditional ones like Boeing remain highly attractive to these students. With Elon Muskdoublinghis forecast for Tesla s vehicle production when he announced this week thatthe 2020 target for Tesla vehicles is closer to a million the need for top talent has never been greater. That said it s remarkable to see so many young engineers enamored with Tesla.What was Universum s research methodology Universum takes a look at the employers by which students on the cusp of joining the workforce are most intrigued. To determine the companies currently providing the most coveted jobs to students at American universities Universum surveyed nearly 72 223 undergraduates at 359 universities in 165 areas of study including 11 544 engineering majors.Students were surveyed over a five month period... identifying companies for which they would most want to work.

So what are the top traits hiring managers need to look for and how do they spot them in a candidate According toElon Musk it s not about what school you went to or your level of education. There s no need even to have a college degree at all or even high school the Tesla CEO said during a2014 interview with Auto Bild.Don t miss The best credit cards for building creditInstead Musk looks for evidence of exceptional ability when it comes to hiring. If there s a track record of exceptional achievement then it s likely that that will continue into the future he said.How Elon Musk spots a liarThe problem is that anyone can say they re the best at what they do but it can be hard and at times impossible to know whether they re telling the truth.Luckily Musk revealed his solution at theWorld Government Summitin 2017. He asks each candidate he interviews the same question Tell me about some of the most difficult problems you worked on and how you solved them. Because the people whoreallysolved the problem know exactly how they solved it he said. They know and can describe the little details. Musk s method hinges on the idea that someone making a false claim will lack the ability to back it up convincingly so he wants to hear them talk about how they worked through a thorny issue step by step.Musk s strategy is effective study findsA study published inthe Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognitionlast year in December uncovered several approaches to spotting liars based on a job interviewing technique that funnily enough backs up the effectiveness of what Musk has been doing for years.One such technique called Asymmetric Information Management AIM is designed to provide an interviewee with a clear means to demonstrate their innocence or guilt to the investigator by providing detailed information. Small details are the lifeblood of forensic investigations and can provide investigators with facts to check and witnesses to question Cody Porter one of the study s authors and a Senior Teaching Fellow at the University of Portsmouth wrote in an article for The Conversation.Specifically she added interviewers should give clear instructions to interviewees that if they provide longer more detailed statements about the event of interest then the investigator will be better able to detect if they are telling the truth or lying. Porter and her team of researchers found that truth tellers typically seek to demonstrate their innocence and commonly provide more detailed information in response to such instructions. In contrast liars wish to conceal their guilt Porter explained. This means they are more likely to strategically withhold information in response to the AIM method. Their assumption here is that providing more information will make it easier for the investigator to detect their lie so instead they provide less information. If you want the job tell the truth and be as detailed as possibleThe study also found that using the AIM method can increase the likelihood of detecting liars by nearly 70 . That s good news for Musk and other hiring managers who adopt this science backed strategy.As Musk said in the interview with Auto Bild what he really wants to know is whether a candidate truly solved the problem they claimed to have solved. And of course you want to make sure if there was some significant accomplishment were they really responsible or was someone else more responsible Musk added. Usually someone who really had to struggle with a problem they really understand the details and they don t forget. After all no one wants to hire someone who is all talk and no action. So if you want the job don t skimp on the details.Tom Popomaronisis a leadership expert and vice president of innovation atMassive Alliance.His work has been featured in Forbes Fast Company Inc. and The Washington Post.

Elon Musk wants to build a city outside Austin. Here s what we know.NewsSportsHookem.comAustin360OpinionAdvertiseObituarieseNewspaperLegalsSubscribeNEWSElon Musk wants to build his own town in Bastrop report saysKara CarlsonAustin American StatesmanElon Musk could be looking to build out his own town in Bastrop County according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.The billionaire who moved to Texas in 2020 and has relocated or expanded a number of his companies into Central Texas has a vision to build out a Texas utopia along the Colorado River in Bastrop County where employees could live and work thereportsaid. It said the billionaire s town has been discussed extensively by executives at the Boring Co. Musk s tunneling and infrastructure company.The town would be built on land near two of Musk s companies in Bastrop County.Mapping Musklandia A guide to Elon Musk related activity in the Austin areaWhy Elon Musk already lives in TexasThe Boring Co. founded in California moved its headquarters to Pflugerville in recent years. The company has been building an 80 000 square foot manufacturing and warehouse facility on a Bastrop County property where it plans to test tunneling equipment and dig as many tunnels as needed for research and development purposes according to state filings. Currently the Boring Co. site is in unincorporated Bastrop County.SpaceX Musk s aerospace company has been building a 43 million facility with more than 500 000 square feet on a neighboring parcel.Musk said he moved to the state to be closer to his two biggest focuses Giga Texas the Tesla manufacturing site in southeastern Travis County and SpaceX s South Texas site.In addition to the Tesla Boring and SpaceX facilities Musk s neurotechnology company Neuralink is constructing an eight building lab and office space in Del Valle.Musk has also moved his private foundation to Austin.More Tesla Boring Company just the start of Elon Musk s influence in Austin analysts sayBoring Co. SpaceX and Tesla employees could live in Snailbrook Texas The Wall Street Journal report cited deed records and people familiar with the plans and said Musk has been meeting with landowners and real estate agents. The Journal also reported that Musk and Boring Co. executives have researched and discussed incorporating a town in Bastrop County.The report said Musk envisions that employees from Boring Co. Tesla and SpaceX could live in new homes with below market rents. It also said the Bastrop site already includes modular homes an outdoor sports area and a gym.Gapped Bass LLC an entity associated with the Boring Co. has been buying up hundreds of acresof properties in Bastrop County. The report said the town would sit on Gapped Bass land. According to the report which cited an advertisement last year Boring Co. employees were able to apply for two or three bedroom houses that they rented starting at about 800 a month. If they leave the job or are fired they would need vacate within 30 days the report said.The plans are also in line with an application for a wastewater permit for the Boring Co. site about which the Statesmanreported last year. The application mentions that the company expects up to 100 employees a day to be on the site and that the site has several warehouses and office buildings 15 on site employee housing units a recreational court and parking. It also said plans include an on site bistro or cafe more employee housing and more parking.Some neighbors have raised concerns about the Boring Co. s Bastrop expansion plans. In recent months banners with a snail the company s mascot have been spotted at the Boring Co. Bastrop site. They say Welcome to snailbrook. Filings in the areafor a Project Amazing also have shown plans to build housing. Plans for the project show more than 100 housing units on 108 acres with streets named for the company including Boring Boulevard and Cutterhead Crossing.The report said there are also plans to build a private residential compound for Musk a distance from town as a separate project citing people familiar with the plans. Musk has said he lives in a tiny home near Brownsville on property owned by SpaceX and has disputed media reports that he is using a wealthy friend s house when in Austin. But the billionaire does spend significant time in Austin. Flight records show that Muskspent more time in Central Texasthan in any other place from 2021 through August 2022.The Journal report said the Bastrop plans could grow even bigger. Boring Co. President Steve Davis has reportedly described plans that would include creating an entire city. The report cited people familiar with the plans and text messages viewed by Journal reporters. The report also said Davis mentioned during a company all hands meeting that there could be a future election for mayor of the city. Under Texas law a town would need at least 201 residents to apply to be incorporated and would need approval from a county judge.Still the Boring Co. has a history of lofty plans but nationally it has just one public tunnel in Las Vegas. In recent years the company has reached out to a number of Central Texas cities and other entities about potential tunneling projects but nothing has materialized.More Elon Musk s Boring Co. has floated idea of building tunnel from Tesla to downtown Austin Snailbrook not Elon Musk s first Texas city ideaIt s also not the first time Musk has floated the idea of a city or town in Texas. In 2021 hetweetedthat he wanted to create the city of Starbase Texas a reference to his South Texas SpaceX operations.The report also said that Musk s former girlfriend Grimes as well as Kanye West and West s architectural designer have been involved in broad discussions about the town citing people familiar with the conversations. But the report said the discussions have not led to concrete plans.More Controversial permit for Elon Musk s Boring Company to dump wastewater heads to public meetingThe report comes as the company seeks a permit to build a wastewater treatment facility on its research and development site in Bastrop County to treat and discharge wastewater related to tunnel boring equipment manufacturing an on site bistro on site housing and sanitary water related to restrooms.Concerns have been raised by members of the community and environmental groups who along with state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt D Austin who formerly represented the Bastrop area where the Boring Co. site is requested a public meeting on the permit. That meeting will be held March 21.If the permit is granted the company would be able to dispose of 142 500 gallons of treated wastewater a day directly into the Colorado River below Lady Bird Lake according to the draft permit issued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

By creating the town Musk would be able to set some of the city s regulations. Last year at an all hands meeting of Boring employees president Steve Davis reportedly talked about holding an election for mayor of the city.The proposed municipality is said to be adjacent to the Boring andSpaceXfacilities that are currently under construction and to already include some modular homes and signs hang from poles reading welcome snailbrook tx est. 2021 Snailbrook is the name of Boring s mascot.Musk reportedly wants to offer rental houses to workers that are well below the local market value. One ad allegedly put the price of a two or three bedroom home at 800 compared to 2 200 a month in nearby Bastrop Texas. There are also plans for a Montessori school in the municipalityTexas law requires an area to have at least 201 residents before it can incorporate. Plans which theJournalshows in its story call for the construction of 110 more homes in the area where Snailbrook is located.Over the past three years entities tied to Musk have bought at least 3 500 acres in the general Austin area. TheJournalsays some reports indicate Musk controls as much as 6 000 acres.Muskfirst came to Texastwo years ago abandoning California and calling it the land of overregulation overlitigation overtaxation. Last month though Teslaannounced plans toexpand its California presence moving its engineering headquarters to the state.Should Musk be building his own city he won t be the only Texas billionaire to own a town. In 2021 Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cubanpurchased the entire town of Mustang Texasfor an undisclosed amount.The city had been for sale since 2017 originally with an asking price of 4 million. It eventually dropped to 2 million but still couldn t find a buyer. Mustang is located about an hour south of Dallas in Navarro County right off of Interstate 45.

The working name isn t Muskville but Snailbrook the mascot of the Boring Company.In meetings with landowners and real estate agents Musk has reportedly described his idea for the estate which he envisions building on thousands of acres of property he purchased on the Colorado River as a utopia so that his employees can live work and play without ever leaving. That pitch soundsawfully familiar. He has tasked his engineers at the Boring Company to research how to incorporate the town within Bastrop County which would allow him to set local regulations and speed up his building plans. Advisers on the project include Musk s ex girlfriend Grimes as well asHitler likerYe who toured the site with his personal architectural designer last year. Two years ago Musk also reportedly discussed the idea of building a town with his brother Kimball to figure out how to set up an off the grid settlement.Elon Musk Is Planning a Company Town in Texas Could set own regulations would have private compound Tesla SpaceX employees would live there Grimes Kanye West involved in discussionshttps t.co 0OjyCPw25Epic.twitter.com Ml3I67CWug Christopher Mims mims March 9 2023A lot of grand Musk projectsnever end up actually happening. And he isn t known fortransparency so it s not surprising that many of the basics of the company town idea like how big a town this might be remain unknown. As it stands Bastrop County which surrounds Musk s land has not received an application from him or any of his associated companies. But over the past three years Musk and his LLCs have purchased at least 3 500 acres of land in the area. Steve Davis Boring Company s president also reportedly told employees last year that the settlement would need to hold elections for mayor a tough race to win for an opponent if Musk enters the race. According to state law a town needs at least 201 residents before it can apply to incorporate.Texas isn t a bad place for a billionaire trying to build a town from scratch what with its lax zoning laws and environmental requirements and lack of corporate income tax or state income tax . Succeeding at building a functioning company town is a tall order consideringeverything else on Musk s plate.

But when there are no rules or regulations there can be unexpected problemsWed 15 Mar 2023 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 16 Mar 2023 01.26 EDTSay what you like about Elon Musk but he certainly keeps himself busy. Most people would have their hands full running Twitter into the ground fathering multiple children publiclymockingformeremployees testing brain chips in pigs sucking upbillions in government subsidies building cars and trying to go to Mars. Musk on the other hand is juggling all that while also building a town in Texas to house his serfs and sycophants.The new community is called Snailbrook in reference to the mascot for Musk s Boring Company and according to reports in theWall Street Journal Musk has described it as a Texas utopia where his employees can live and work.Muskrelocatedto Texas from California in 2020 and slammed his former home as the land of sort ofoverregulation overlitigation overtaxation . Not content with Texas s more lax regulations and lack of income tax it seems suspiciously as if he s trying to build his own town so he can have even more freedom to do whatever he likes such as applying to dump millions ofgallons of wastewater on its land near the Colorado River without boring old government regulations slowing him down. Musk reportedly asked Steve Adler who served as the mayor of Austin Texas until earlier this year for assurances that his projects wouldn t run into bureaucracy. What he wanted from the city was speed Alder told the Wall Street Journal.Musk isn t the first libertarian to try to build his own regulation free utopia. Heard of theFree Town Project In the mid 2000s a group of libertarian activists decided to turn a small New Hampshire town called Grafton into anAyn Rand inspiredparadise. No rules no regulations just vibes. AsMatthew Hongoltz Hetlingwrites in his book about the experiment hundreds of weirdos descended on Grafton and started stripping away all public services. Everything fell apart and hungry bears began invading the town. The libertarians started fighting each other the bears and an angry llama called Hurricane. Long story short the experiment was not a success.Let s see if Snailbrook fares any better. The good news for Musk is that Texas doesn t have many bears.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistTopicsElon MuskOpinioncommentReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedThe Guardian viewColumnistsLettersOpinion videosCartoonsNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top 2023Guardian News Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But this week before the planned launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket the entrepreneur gave members of the website Reddita small peekinto his brain.Musk had asked his Twitter followers to focus their questions on Tuesday s rocket launch which his companyended up abortingafter a malfunction. And many of the queries on Reddit s Ask me Anything forum were about the Falcon 9 and the mechanics of its launch and landing.Why was the latest SpaceX launch delayed 03 47But Musk talked about other aspects of his life as well including his favorite video games and drinks. He even sent around aYouTube cat video. Here are seven things people learned about him this week He likes to shower.Asked what daily habit has the largest positive impact on his life Musk quipped Showering. How he learns.Musk is deeply involved in the development of electric cars and space exploration. He s also the chairman of solar leasing company SolarCity SCTY as well as a co founder of PayPal. His level of knowledge runs deep and one Reddit user asked him how he learned so much so fast.He answered that most people are able to learn a lot more than they think. They sell themselves short without trying he added. Musk also gave some advice on how to learn more. View knowledge as a semantic tree he said. Make sure you understand the trunk and big branches or the fundamental principles before moving on to the leaves or the details.Elon Musk on his family history01 29He doesn t sleep much.Musk said he sleeps an average of about six hours a night. He s even measured this on his phone. Not exactly the seven to nine hours that doctors generally recommend for adults.His favorite teacher.Musk said the best teacher he ever had was his elementary school principal who began teaching math after the regular math teacher quit. The principal decided to accelerate the syllabus by a year and we had to work like the house was on fire Musk said. If the students worked hard the teacher told stories of his time as a soldier in World War II. Everybody did the work he added.He s not interested in politics.When asked if he would ever consider becoming a politician Musk had a one word answer Unlikely. Indeed it s hard to imagine how a place like Congress would be appealing to someone who thinks about rocket ships and electric cars all day.His favorite foods and drink.He likes French food and barbecue. His preferred alcohol is whiskey.His favorite video games.Musk said he likes first person shooter games that also tell a story such as Bioshock Fallout or Mass Effect. He s also a big fan of Warcraft but it s unclear if he meant the original Warcraft games or the online World of Warcraft. How does Musk have time for video games One Reddit user was suspicious. He s probably hiding time travel from us. That would not be a surprise.Kim PetersonKim Peterson is a financial journalist covering business and the economy.

Andrew Harrer Bloomberg Comment on this storyCommentGiftArticleShareEven tech billionaires occasionally get tripped up by the rules. In the case of Tesla chief executive Elon Musk he may need to rethink the name of his new baby boy X A 12.Musk announced Monday that he and his girlfriend singer Grimes had welcomed a baby son and given it a name that he broke down how to correctly pronounceduring an interviewwith podcast host Joe Rogan this week. He identified the second character as ash saying it was pronounced X Ash A 12.Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.ArrowRightBut California where Musk lives allows only the 26 English letters of the alphabet to be used on birth certificates along with a limited list of special characters including apostrophes hyphens and periods. That means no numbers or symbols.It s unclear if Musk will need to change the baby s name or if the couple may have used a completely different name on the legal birth certificate. Already Twitter is blowing up with theories on whether Musk is playing games by announcing the name.AdvertisementTesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.It s not the first time a tech founder billionaire s ability to think big and buck the rules has landed them in conflict with local state and even federal regulations. It s part of the culture of Silicon Valley to move fast and break things an early Facebook motto that has become embedded in the way many start ups and their founders think.Elon Musk mobilizes tech elites behind reopening societyApple visionary Steve Jobs avoided having a license plate on the back of his Mercedes taking advantage of a now closed loophole but it required him to replace the car every six months. Facebook s Mark Zuckerbergtried to secure exclusive rights to landhe had bought in Hawaii an expensive move prompting backlash from residents that forced him to backtrack. And Sun Microsystems co founder and billionaire Vinod Khosla tried to close access to a popular California public beach after he bought a large parcel of land that included the only access road prompting a lawsuitfrom the state.AdvertisementMusk himself has previously landed in hot water for his brash behavior. The Securities and Exchange Commissionfined him and Teslaeach 20 million after he tweeted that he could take his company private for 420 a share. And a British cave explorer sued for defamation after Muskreferred to him as a pedo guy in a tweet a lawsuit the tech billionaire ultimately won.Recently he has beenpushing for an endto shelter in place orders during the coronavirus pandemic. Now he will bump up against California rules on names.X A 12 Musk Elon Musk elonmusk May 5 2020During the podcast interview Musk gave Grimes credit for thinking up most of the name but he said the A 12 was his contribution a nod to the Archangel 12 plane. The Lockheed A 12 was a precursor to the SR 71 which Musk called the coolest plane ever. Grimes also gave an interpretation of the name on Twitter writing that X is the unknown variable is her elven spelling meaning love or artificial intelligence and A 12 is indeed the Archangel 12. X the unknown variable my elven spelling of Ai love or Artificial intelligence A 12 precursor to SR 17 our favorite aircraft . No weapons no defenses just speed. Great in battle but non violent A Archangel my favorite song metal rat Grimes Grimezsz May 6 2020But the name has also prompted theories on Twitter namely that the name is pronounced Kyle. The reasoning X is the Greek letter Chi which has a K sound makes an ai sound and A 12 refers to L or the 12th letter of the alphabet.View Tweet on TwitterCommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleElon Musk and TwitterHAND CURATEDHow Elon Musk knocked Tesla s Full Self Driving off courseMarch 19 2023How Elon Musk knocked Tesla s Full Self Driving off courseMarch 19 2023At Elon Musk s brittle Twitter tweaks trigger massive outagesMarch 6 2023At Elon Musk s brittle Twitter tweaks trigger massive outagesMarch 6 2023Musk meets with GOP tech critics and Biden aides during D.C. visitJanuary 27 2023Musk meets with GOP tech critics and Biden aides during D.C. visitJanuary 27 2023View 3 more storiesView moreLoading...TOP STORIESThe DownloadStay up to date on the news from Silicon Valley and how to take back control of your data and devices.You can get better sleep with wearables.

His success as a serial entrepreneur though follows an eventful childhood in which a young Musk played with homemade rockets coded his own video games and endured hardships both at school and home.Here are eight things you might not know about Musk s youth.1. He went door to door selling candy to rich peopleWhile growing up in Pretoria Musk his brother Kimbal and their cousins traveled around the wealthy parts of the South African capital selling homemade chocolate Easter eggs.The adventurous group traveled door to door selling the sweets for 20 times the cost of making them.VIDEO1 0201 02Elon Musk s brother says this is how you raise entrepreneurial kidsMake It Voices I d make them for 50 cents and charge 10 for an Easter egg and I d always get this question like Why are you charging 10 for this little Easter egg said Kimbalto CNBC Make It in a 2017 interview. And I was like Well you re supporting a young capitalist. And the reality is if you don t buy it from me you re not going to get one and I know you can afford 10. 2. He was bulliedMusk has been open about his difficult childhood discussing it most recently in last Sunday s 60 Minutes interview. While he attended grade school in Pretoria South Africa Musk was not only theyoungest and smallest kid in his class but he was nerdier and muchmore into booksthan manyjocks at school.In Ashlee Vance s 2015 book Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future Musk said gangs of boys at would sometimes hunt him down going so far as to push him down a flight of stairs in one instance and send him to the hospital. I was almost beaten to death he addedon 60 Minutes. The bullying continueduntil he was 15 years old when went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself by doing karate judo and wrestling. By 16 he said he was dishing it out as hard as they d give it to me. 3. His parents thought he was deafMusk was so introspective as a kid that his parents and doctors ordered tests to check if he was deaf. His mother Maye Musk eventually learned this was his way of daydreaming about his inventions. He goes into his brain and then you just see he is in another world. He still does that. Now I just leave him be because I know he is designing a new rocket or something recalled Maye Musk in Vance s book.Though this bothered his peers who could reportedly yell at him and do jumping jacks beside him and he wouldn t notice Musk s pensive moments allowed him to visualize projects he d hope to tackle.4. He made his own explosives and rocketsWhile his parents were away Musk lived mostly under the watch of a housekeeper. According to Musk she was mainly there to make sure he didn t break anything.VIDEO1 5701 57The one trait that Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have in commonThe Definitive Guide to Business She wasn t like watching me. I was off making explosives and reading books and building rockets and doing things that could have gotten me killed said Musk. I m shocked that I have all my fingers. 5. He had a penchant for readingThroughout his childhood books played a crucial role in fueling Musk s ambitions and entertaining him.Said Musk I was raised by books. Books and then my parents. He reportedly read the entire Encyclopedia Britannicaat age nineand would pore over science fiction novels comics and nonfiction books for up to 10 hours a day. Some of themost influential books he readincluded The Lord of the Rings The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and Isaac Asimov s Foundation series.6. He coded his own video game at 12 and got 500 for itIn the early days of computer coding a 12 year old Musk built a Blastar a science fiction inspired space game. Similar to the classic Space Invaders arcade game the objective in Blastar was to destroy an alien spacecraft carrying deadly bombs.Although he s since called it atrivial game Blastar earned Musk an easy 500 after a South African trade publication published its source code.7. He was master at Dungeons DragonsAlong with his cousins Musk loved playing the fantasy role playing game. One time the teens went to Johannesburg for a Dungeons Dragons tournament. That was us being nerd masters supremes Musk told Vance.VIDEO1 2901 29Ex Google exec 3 traits that make Elon Musk an exceptional leader and one major flawThe Definitive Guide to BusinessAccording to his cousin Peter Rive Musk helped their team win the tournament with his incredible imagination and ability to keep people captivated and inspired. 8. He tried opening his own video arcade at 16Along with his younger cousins and Kimbal Muskgot the idea to open an arcadeby their high school according to Vance s book. They got as far as signing a lease setting contracts together filling out forms at the city planning department. But their plans were foiled when the city told them they were too young to get a real estate permit without an adult to sign off.According to Kimbal both his father and uncle flipped out when they brought up their arcade plans.9. He moved to North America as a teenagerOnce Elon reached his teens he moved from his native South Africa tobegin his college studiesin North America. At 17 he first emigrated to see what it takes to live he told Neil DeGrasse Tysonon StarTalk Radio. Musk found that in America it s pretty easy to keep yourself alive. Given that his threshold for existing was pretty low Musk was determined to survive on 1 a day by buying food at the supermarket in bulk. I went more for the hotdogs and oranges you do get really tired of hot dogs and oranges after a while said Musk. mixing things up every now and then with some pasta and green pepper and a big thing of sauce which he said could go pretty far too.

In this excerpt from his latest book Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future Ecco Ashlee Vance chronicles the engineer and entrepreneur s global jump.Musk s great escape to Canada was not well thought out.He knew of a great uncle in Montreal hopped on a flight and hoped for the best. Upon landing in June 1988 Musk found a pay phone and tried to use directory assistance to find his uncle. When that didn t work he called his mother collect. She had bad news. Maye had sent a letter to the uncle before Musk left and received a reply while her son was in transit. The uncle had gone to Minnesota meaning Musk had nowhere to stay. Bags in hand Musk headed for a youth hostel.After spending a few days in Montreal exploring the city Musk tried to come up with a long term plan. Maye had family scattered all across Canada and Musk began reaching out to them. He bought a countrywide bus ticket that let him hop on and off as he pleased for one hundred dollars and opted to head to Saskatchewan the former home of his grandfather. After a 1 900 mile bus ride he ended up in Swift Current a town of fifteen thousand people. Musk called a second cousin out of the blue from the bus station and hitched a ride to his house.Musk spent the next year working a series of odd jobs around Canada. He tended vegetables and shoveled out grain bins at a cousin s farm located in the tiny town of Waldeck. Musk celebrated his eighteenth birthday there sharing a cake with the family he d just met and a few strangers from the neighborhood. After that he learned to cut logs with a chain saw in Vancouver British Columbia. The hardest job Musk took came after a visit to the unemployment office. He inquired about the job with the best wage which turned out to be a gig cleaning the boiler room of a lumber mill for eighteen dollars an hour. You have to put on this hazmat suit and then shimmy through this little tunnel that you can barely fit in Musk said. Then you have a shovel and you take the sand and goop and other residue which is still steaming hot and you have to shovel it through the same hole you came through. There is no escape. Someone else on the other side has to shovel it into a wheelbarrow. If you stay in there for more than thirty minutes you get too hot and die. Thirty people started out at the beginning of the week. By the third day five people were left. At the end of the week it was just Musk and two other men doing the work.As Musk made his way around Canada his brother sister and mother were figuring out how to get there as well. When Kimbal Musk and Elon eventually reunited in Canada their headstrong playful natures bloomed. Elon ended up enrolling at Queen s University in Kingston Ontario in 1989. He picked Queen s over the University of Waterloo because he felt there were more good looking women at Queen s. Outside of his studies Elon would read the newspaper alongside Kimbal and the two of them would identify interesting people they would like to meet. They then took turns cold calling these people to ask if they were available to have lunch. Among the harassed was the head of marketing for the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team a business writer for the Globe and Mail and a top executive at the Bank of Nova Scotia Peter Nicholson. Nicholson remembered the boys call well. I was not in the habit of getting out of the blue requests he said. I was perfectly prepared to have lunch with a couple of kids that had that kind of gumption. It took six months to get on Nicholson s calendar but sure enough the Musk brothers made a threehour train ride and showed up on time. The second sentence out of his mouth was I think a lot about electric cars. Nicholson s first exposure to the Musk brothers left him with an impression many would share. Both presented themselves well and were polite. Elon though clearly came off as the geekier more awkward counterpoint to the charismatic personable Kimbal. I became more impressed and fascinated as I talked to them Nicholson said. They were so determined. Nicholson ended up offering Elon a summer internship at the bank and became his trusted advisor.Not long after their initial meeting Elon invited Peter Nicholson s daughter Christie to his birthday party. Christie showed up at Maye s Toronto apartment with a jar of homemade lemon curd in hand and was greeted by Elon and about fifteen other people. Elon had never met Christie before but he went right up to her and led her to a couch. Then I believe the second sentence out of his mouth was I think a lot about electric cars Christie said. And then he turned to me and said Do you think about electric cars The conversation left Christie who is now a science writer with the distinct impression that Musk was handsome affable and a tremendous nerd. For whatever reason I was so struck by that moment on the sofa she said. You could tell that this person was very different. He captivated me in that way. With her angular features and blond hair Christie fit Musk s type and the two stayed in touch during Musk s time in Canada. They never really dated but Christie found Musk interesting enough to have lengthy conversations with him on the phone. One night he told me If there was a way that I could not eat so I could work more I would not eat. I wish there was a way to get nutrients without sitting down for a meal. The enormity of his work ethic at that age and his intensity jumped out. It seemed like one of the more unusual things I had ever heard. Media Platforms Design TeamCollege suited Musk.He worked on being less of a know it all while also finding a group of people who respected his intellectual abilities. The university students were less inclined to laugh off or deride his opinionated takes on energy space and whatever else was captivating him at the moment. Musk had found people who responded to his ambition rather than mocking it and he fed on this environment.Navaid Farooq a Canadian who grew up in Geneva ended up in Musk s freshman year dormitory in the fall of 1990. Both men were placed in the international section where a Canadian student would get paired with a student from overseas. Musk sort of broke the system since he technically counted as a Canadian but knew almost nothing about his surroundings. I had a roommate from Hong Kong and he was a really nice guy Musk said. He religiously attended every lecture which was helpful since I went to the least number of classes possible. For a time Musk sold computer parts and full PCs in the dorm to make some extra cash. I could build something to suit their needs like a tricked out gaming machine or a simple word processor that cost less than what they could get in a store Musk said. Or if their computer didn t boot properly or had a virus I d fix it. I could pretty much solve any problem. Farooq and Musk bonded over their backgrounds living abroad and a shared interest in strategy board games. I don t think he makes friends easily but he is very loyal to those he has Farooq said. When the video game Civilization was released the college chums spent hours building their empire much to the dismay of Farooq s girlfriend who was forgotten in another room. Elon could lose himself for hours on end Farooq said. The students also relished their loner lifestyles. We are the kinds of people that can be by ourselves at a party and not feel awkward Farooq said. We can think to ourselves and not feel socially weird about it. Musk was more ambitious in college than he d been in high school. He studied business competed in public speaking contests and began to display the brand of intensity and competitiveness that marks his behavior today. After one economics exam Musk Farooq and some other students in class came back to the dorms and began comparing notes to try to ascertain how well they did on the test. It soon became clear that Musk had a firmer grasp on the material than anyone else. This was a group of fairly high achievers and Elon stood way outside of the bell curve Farooq said. Musk s intensity has continued to be a constant in their long relationship. When Elon gets into something he develops just this different level of interest in it than other people. That is what differentiates Elon from the rest of humanity. In 1992 having spent two years at Queen s Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania on a scholarship. Musk saw the Ivy League school as possibly opening some additional doors and went off in pursuit of dual degrees first an economics degree from the Wharton School and then a bachelor s degree in physics. Justine stayed at Queen s pursuing her dream of becoming a writer and maintained a long distance relationship with Musk. Now and again she would visit him and the two would sometimes head off to New York for a romantic weekend. It was a full out unlicensed speakeasy Musk blossomed even more at Penn and really started to feel comfortable while hanging out with his fellow physics students. At Penn he met people that thought like him Maye said. There were some nerds there. He so enjoyed them. I remember going for lunch with them and they were talking physics things. They were saying A plus B equals pi squared or whatever. They would laugh out loud. It was cool to see him so happy. Once again however Musk did not make many friends among the broader school body. It s difficult to find former students who remember him being there at all. But he did make one very close friend named Adeo Ressi who would go on to be a Silicon Valley entrepreneur in his own right and is to this day as tight with Elon as anyone.Ressi is a lanky guy well over six feet tall and possesses an eccentric air. He was the artistic colorful foil to the studious more buttoned up Musk. Both of the young men were transfer students and ended up being placed in the funky freshman dorm. The lackluster social scene did not live up to Ressi s expectations and he talked Musk into renting a large house off campus. They got the ten bedroom home relatively cheap since it was a frat house that had gone unrented. During the week Musk and Ressi would study but as the weekend approached Ressi in particular would transform the house into a nightclub. He covered the windows with trash bags to make it pitch black inside and decorated the walls with bright paints and whatever objects he could find. It was a full out unlicensed speakeasy Ressi said. We would have as many as five hundred people. We would charge five dollars and it would be pretty much all you could drink beer and Jell O shots and other things. Come Friday night the ground around the house would shake from the intensity of the bass being pumped out by Ressi s speakers. Maye visited one of the parties and discovered that Ressi had hammered objects into the walls and lacquered them with glowin the dark paint. She ended up working the door as the coat check money taker and grabbed a pair of scissors for protection as the cash piled up in a shoe box.A second house had fourteen rooms. Musk Ressi and one other person lived there. They fashioned tables by laying plywood on top of used kegs and came up with other makeshift furniture ideas. Musk returned home one day to find that Ressi had nailed his desk to the wall and then painted it in Day Glo colors. Musk retaliated by pulling his desk down painting it black and studying. I m like Dude that s installation art in our party house said Ressi. Remind Musk of this incident and he ll respond matter of factly It was a desk. Musk will have the occasional vodka and Diet Coke but he s not a big drinker and does not really care for the taste of alcohol. Somebody had to stay sober during these parties Musk said. I was paying my own way through college and could make an entire month s rent in one night. Adeo was in charge of doing cool shit around the house and I would run the party. As Ressi put it Elon was the most straight laced dude you have ever met. He never drank. He never did anything. Zero. Literally nothing. The only time Ressi had to step in and moderate Musk s behavior came during video game binges that could go on for days.Musk s longtime interest in solar power and in finding other new ways to harness energy expanded at Penn.In December 1994 he had to come up with a business plan for one of his classes and ended up writing a paper titled The Importance of Being Solar. The document started with a bit of Musk s wry sense of humor. At the top of the page he wrote The sun will come out tomorrow. . . . Little Orphan Annie on the subject of renewable energy. The paper went on to predict a rise in solar power technology based on materials improvements and the construction of large scale solar plants. Musk delved deeply into how solar cells work and the various compounds that can make them more efficient. He concluded the paper with a drawing of the power station of the future. It depicted a pair of giant solar arrays in space each four kilometers in width sending their juice down to Earth via microwave beams to a receiving antenna with a seven kilometer diameter. Musk received a 98 on what his professor deemed a very interesting and well written paper. A second paper talked about taking research documents and books and electronically scanning them performing optical character recognition and putting all of the information in a single database much like a mix between today s Google Books and Google Scholar. And a third paper dwelled on another of Musk s favorite topics ultracapacitors. In the forty four page document Musk is plainly jubilant over the idea of a new form of energy storage that would suit his future pursuits with cars planes and rockets. Pointing to the latest research coming out of a lab in Silicon Valley he wrote The end result represents the first new means of storing significant amounts of electrical energy since the development of the battery and fuel cell. Furthermore because the Ultracapacitor retains the basic properties of a capacitor it can deliver its energy over one hundred times faster than a battery of equivalent weight and be recharged just as quickly. Musk received a 97 for this effort and praise for a very thorough analysis with excellent financials I told... my ex wife about these ideas. It probably sounded like super crazy talk. The remarks from the professor were spot on. Musk s clear concise writing is the work of a logician moving from one point to the next with precision. What truly stood out though was Musk s ability to master difficult physics concepts in the midst of actual business plans. Even then he showed an unusual knack for being able to perceive a path from a scientific advance to a for profit enterprise.As Musk began to think more seriously about what he would do after college he briefly considered getting into the videogame business. He d been obsessed with video games since his childhood and had held a gaming internship. But he came to see them as not quite grand enough a pursuit. I really like computer games but then if I made really great computer games how much effect would that have on the world he said. It wouldn t have a big effect. Even though I have an intrinsic love of video games I couldn t bring myself to do that as a career. In interviews Musk often makes sure that people know he had some truly big ideas on his mind during this period of his life. As he tells it he would daydream at Queen s and Penn and usually end up with the same conclusion he viewed the Internet renewable energy and space as the three areas that would undergo significant change in the years to come and as the markets where he could make a big impact. He vowed to pursue projects in all three. I told all my ex girlfriends and my ex wife about these ideas he said. It probably sounded like super crazy talk. Musk s insistence on explaining the early origins of his passion for electric cars solar energy and rockets can come off as insecure. It feels as if Musk is trying to shape his life story in a forced way. But for Musk the distinction between stumbling into something and having intent is important. Musk has long wanted the world to know that he s different from the run of the mill entrepreneur in Silicon Valley. He wasn t just sniffing out trends and he wasn t consumed by the idea of getting rich. He s been in pursuit of a master plan all along. I really was thinking about this stuff in college he said. It is not some invented story after the fact. I don t want to seem like a Johnny come lately or that I m chasing a fad or just being opportunistic. I m not an investor. I like to make technologies real that I think are important for the future and useful in some sort of way.

He religiously attended every lecture which was helpful since I went to the least number of classes possible. For a time Musk sold computer parts and full PCs in the dorm to make some extra cash. I could build something to suit their needs like a tricked out gaming machine or a simple word processor that cost less than what they could get in a store Musk said. Or if their computer didn t boot properly or had a virus I d fix it. I could pretty much solve any problem. Farooq and Musk bonded over their backgrounds living abroad and a shared interest in strategy board games. I don t think he makes friends easily but he is very loyal to those he has Farooq said. When the video game Civilization was released the college chums spent hours building their empire much to the dismay of Farooq s girlfriend who was forgotten in another room. Elon could lose himself for hours on end Farooq said. The students also relished their loner lifestyles. We are the kinds of people that can be by ourselves at a party and not feel awkward Farooq said. We can think to ourselves and not feel socially weird about it. Musk was more ambitious in college than he d been in high school. He studied business competed in public speaking contests and began to display the brand of intensity and competitiveness that marks his behavior today. After one economics exam Musk Farooq and some other students in class came back to the dorms and began comparing notes to try to ascertain how well they did on the test. It soon became clear that Musk had a firmer grasp on the material than anyone else. This was a group of fairly high achievers and Elon stood way outside of the bell curve Farooq said. Musk s intensity has continued to be a constant in their long relationship. When Elon gets into something he develops just this different level of interest in it than other people. That is what differentiates Elon from the rest of humanity. In 1992 having spent two years at Queen s Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania on a scholarship. Musk saw the Ivy League school as possibly opening some additional doors and went off in pursuit of dual degrees first an economics degree from the Wharton School and then a bachelor s degree in physics. Justine stayed at Queen s pursuing her dream of becoming a writer and maintained a long distance relationship with Musk. Now and again she would visit him and the two would sometimes head off to New York for a romantic weekend. It was a full out unlicensed speakeasy Musk blossomed even more at Penn and really started to feel comfortable while hanging out with his fellow physics students. At Penn he met people that thought like him Maye said. There were some nerds there. He so enjoyed them. I remember going for lunch with them and they were talking physics things. They were saying A plus B equals pi squared or whatever. They would laugh out loud. It was cool to see him so happy. Once again however Musk did not make many friends among the broader school body. It s difficult to find former students who remember him being there at all. But he did make one very close friend named Adeo Ressi who would go on to be a Silicon Valley entrepreneur in his own right and is to this day as tight with Elon as anyone.Ressi is a lanky guy well over six feet tall and possesses an eccentric air. He was the artistic colorful foil to the studious more buttoned up Musk. Both of the young men were transfer students and ended up being placed in the funky freshman dorm. The lackluster social scene did not live up to Ressi s expectations and he talked Musk into renting a large house off campus. They got the ten bedroom home relatively cheap since it was a frat house that had gone unrented. During the week Musk and Ressi would study but as the weekend approached Ressi in particular would transform the house into a nightclub. He covered the windows with trash bags to make it pitch black inside and decorated the walls with bright paints and whatever objects he could find. It was a full out unlicensed speakeasy Ressi said. We would have as many as five hundred people. We would charge five dollars and it would be pretty much all you could drink beer and Jell O shots and other things. Come Friday night the ground around the house would shake from the intensity of the bass being pumped out by Ressi s speakers. Maye visited one of the parties and discovered that Ressi had hammered objects into the walls and lacquered them with glowin the dark paint. She ended up working the door as the coat check money taker and grabbed a pair of scissors for protection as the cash piled up in a shoe box.A second house had fourteen rooms. Musk Ressi and one other person lived there. They fashioned tables by laying plywood on top of used kegs and came up with other makeshift furniture ideas. Musk returned home one day to find that Ressi had nailed his desk to the wall and then painted it in Day Glo colors. Musk retaliated by pulling his desk down painting it black and studying. I m like Dude that s installation art in our party house said Ressi. Remind Musk of this incident and he ll respond matter of factly It was a desk. Musk will have the occasional vodka and Diet Coke but he s not a big drinker and does not really care for the taste of alcohol. Somebody had to stay sober during these parties Musk said. I was paying my own way through college and could make an entire month s rent in one night. Adeo was in charge of doing cool shit around the house and I would run the party. As Ressi put it Elon was the most straight laced dude you have ever met. He never drank. He never did anything. Zero. Literally nothing. The only time Ressi had to step in and moderate Musk s behavior came during video game binges that could go on for days.Musk s longtime interest in solar power and in finding other new ways to harness energy expanded at Penn.In December 1994 he had to come up with a business plan for one of his classes and ended up writing a paper titled The Importance of Being Solar. The document started with a bit of Musk s wry sense of humor. At the top of the page he wrote The sun will come out tomorrow. . . . Little Orphan Annie on the subject of renewable energy. The paper went on to predict a rise in solar power technology based on materials improvements and the construction of large scale solar plants. Musk delved deeply into how solar cells work and the various compounds that can make them more efficient. He concluded the paper with a drawing of the power station of the future. It depicted a pair of giant solar arrays in space each four kilometers in width sending their juice down to Earth via microwave beams to a receiving antenna with a seven kilometer diameter. Musk received a 98 on what his professor deemed a very interesting and well written paper. A second paper talked about taking research documents and books and electronically scanning them performing optical character recognition and putting all of the information in a single database much like a mix between today s Google Books and Google Scholar. And a third paper dwelled on another of Musk s favorite topics ultracapacitors. In the forty four page document Musk is plainly jubilant over the idea of a new form of energy storage that would suit his future pursuits with cars planes and rockets. Pointing to the latest research coming out of a lab in Silicon Valley he wrote The end result represents the first new means of storing significant amounts of electrical energy since the development of the battery and fuel cell. Furthermore because the Ultracapacitor retains the basic properties of a capacitor it can deliver its energy over one hundred times faster than a battery of equivalent weight and be recharged just as quickly. Musk received a 97 for this effort and praise for a very thorough analysis with excellent financials I told... my ex wife about these ideas. It probably sounded like super crazy talk. The remarks from the professor were spot on. Musk s clear concise writing is the work of a logician moving from one point to the next with precision. What truly stood out though was Musk s ability to master difficult physics concepts in the midst of actual business plans. Even then he showed an unusual knack for being able to perceive a path from a scientific advance to a for profit enterprise.As Musk began to think more seriously about what he would do after college he briefly considered getting into the videogame business. He d been obsessed with video games since his childhood and had held a gaming internship. But he came to see them as not quite grand enough a pursuit. I really like computer games but then if I made really great computer games how much effect would that have on the world he said. It wouldn t have a big effect. Even though I have an intrinsic love of video games I couldn t bring myself to do that as a career. In interviews Musk often makes sure that people know he had some truly big ideas on his mind during this period of his life. As he tells it he would daydream at Queen s and Penn and usually end up with the same conclusion he viewed the Internet renewable energy and space as the three areas that would undergo significant change in the years to come and as the markets where he could make a big impact. He vowed to pursue projects in all three. I told all my ex girlfriends and my ex wife about these ideas he said. It probably sounded like super crazy talk. Musk s insistence on explaining the early origins of his passion for electric cars solar energy and rockets can come off as insecure. It feels as if Musk is trying to shape his life story in a forced way. But for Musk the distinction between stumbling into something and having intent is important. Musk has long wanted the world to know that he s different from the run of the mill entrepreneur in Silicon Valley. He wasn t just sniffing out trends and he wasn t consumed by the idea of getting rich. He s been in pursuit of a master plan all along. I really was thinking about this stuff in college he said. It is not some invented story after the fact. I don t want to seem like a Johnny come lately or that I m chasing a fad or just being opportunistic. I m not an investor. I like to make technologies real that I think are important for the future and useful in some sort of way.

TSLA and the private space company SpaceX. Musk wasan early investorin several tech companies and in October 2022 he completed a deal to take Twitter Inc. private.His success and personal style have given rise to comparisons to other colorful tycoons from U.S. history includingSteve Jobs Howard Hughes andHenry Ford. He was named therichest person in the worldwith an estimated net worth of 212 billion as of October 2022.Musk first achieved that distinction in 2021 surpassing Amazon.com Inc. AMZN founder Jeff Bezos.Let s look briefly at the life of the man who has scaled the pinnacle of the business world.Key TakeawaysElon Musk is the charismatic chief executive officer CEO of electric car maker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX.Following a contested process Musk completed a deal to buy Twitter in October 2022 becoming the owner of the social media company.Born and raised in South Africa Musk spent time in Canada before moving to the United States.Educated at the University of Pennsylvania in physics Musk started getting his feet wet as a serial tech entrepreneur with early successes like Zip2 and X.com which merged with a company that became PayPal.Musk has behaved eccentrically from time to time. He has said he has Asperger s syndrome.Bailey Mariner InvestopediaEarly Life and EducationElon Reeve Musk was born in 1971 in Pretoria South Africa the oldest of three children. His father was a South African engineer and his mother was a Canadian model and nutritionist.After his parents divorced in 1980 Musk lived primarily with his father. He would later dub his father a terrible human being...almost every evil thing you could possibly think of he has done. I had a terrible upbringing. I had a lot of adversity growing up. One thing I worry about with my kids is they don t face enough adversity Musk would later say.Bullied as a ChildMusk attended the private English speaking Waterkloof House Preparatory School he started a year early and later graduated from Pretoria Boys High School. A self described bookworm he made few friends in those places. They got my best expletive friend to lure me out of hiding so they could beat me up. And that expletive hurt Musk said. For some reason they decided that I was it and they were going to go after me nonstop. That s what made growing up difficult. For a number of years there was no respite. You get chased around by gangs at school who tried to beat the expletive out of me and then I d come home and it would just be awful there as well. Early AccomplishmentsTechnology became an escape for Musk. At 10 he became acquainted with programming using a Commodore VIC 20 an early and relatively inexpensive home computer. Before long Musk had become proficient enough to create Blastar a video game in the style of Space Invaders. He sold the BASIC code for the game to a PC magazine for 500.In one telling incident from his childhood Musk and his brother planned to open a video game arcade near their school. Their parents nixed the plan.Musk s College YearsAt 17 Musk moved to Canada. He would later obtain Canadian citizenship through his mother.After emigrating to Canada Musk enrolled at Queen s University in Kingston Ontario. It was there that he met Justine Wilson an aspiring writer. They would marry and have five sons together twins and triplets before divorcing in 2008.Entering the U.S.After two years at Queen s University Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania. He took on two majors but his time there wasn t all work and no play. With a fellow student he bought a 10 bedroom fraternity house which they used as an ad hoc nightclub.Musk graduated with a bachelor of science degree in physics in addition to a bachelor of arts in economics from theWharton School.The two majors foreshadowed Musk s career but it was physics that left the deepest impression. Physics is a good framework for thinking he would say later. Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there. Notable AccomplishmentsMusk was 24 years old when he moved to California to pursue a Ph.D. in applied physics at Stanford University. But with the internet exploding and Silicon Valley booming Musk had entrepreneurial visions dancing in his head. He left the Ph.D. program after just two days.X.comIn 1995 with 15 000 and his younger brother Kimbal at his side Musk started Zip2 a web software company that would help newspapers develop online city guides.In 1999 Zip2 was acquired by Compaq Computer Corp. for 341 million.Musk used his Zip2 buyout money to create X.com afintechventure before that term was in wide circulation.X.com merged with a money transfer firm called Confinity and the resulting company came to be known as PayPal.Peter Thiel ousted Musk as PayPal CEO before eBay EBAY bought the payments company for 1.5 billion but Musk still profited from the buyout via his 11.7 PayPal stake. My proceeds from PayPal after tax were about 180 million Musk said in a 2018 interview. 100 million of that went into SpaceX 70 million into Tesla and 10 million into SolarCity. And I literally had to borrow money for rent. In 2017 Musk purchased the X.com domain name back from PayPal citing its sentimental value.TeslaMusk became involved with the electric cars venture as an early investor in 2004 ultimately contributing about 6.3 million to begin with and joined the team including engineer Martin Eberhard to help run a company then known as Tesla Motors. Following a series of disagreements Eberhard was ousted in 2007 and an interim CEO was hired until Musk assumed control as CEO and product architect. Under his watch Tesla has become the world s most valuable automaker.In addition to producing electric vehicles Tesla maintains a robust presence in the solar energy space thanks to its acquisition of SolarCity.The company currently produces two rechargeable solar batteries. The smaller Powerwall was developed for home backup power and off the grid use while the larger Powerpack is intended for commercial or electric utility grid use.SpaceXMusk used most of the proceeds from his PayPal stake to found Space Exploration Technologies Corp. the rocket s developer commonly known as SpaceX. By his own account Musk spent 100 millionto found SpaceX in 2002.Under Musk s leadership SpaceX landed several high profile contracts with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA and the U.S. Air Force to design space launch rockets.Musk has publicized plans to send an astronaut to Mars by 2025 in a collaborative effort with NASA.TwitterA frequent poster on the messaging network Musk disclosed a 9.2 stake in Twitter in April 2022.Twitter responded by offering Musk a seat on the board which he accepted before declining days later.Musk then sent abear hugletter to Twitter s board proposing to buy the company at 54.20 per share.Twitter s board adopted apoison pillprovision to discourage Musk from accumulating an even larger stake but they ultimately accepted Musk s offer after he disclosed 46.5 billion in committed financing for the deal in a securities filing.In July 2022 Muskattempted to cancel the deal arguing that Twitter had failed to provide certain information regarding fake accounts. The companysued Muskto require him to complete the deal.After months of legal wrangling the billionaire s plan to buy the social media platform came to fruition and Musk took control of Twitter on Oct. 28 2022.Personal EccentricitiesOn Sept. 7 2018 Musk smoked cannabis during a filmed interview for a podcast.Just a month earlier Musk posted an infamous tweet claiming he was considering taking Tesla private and had secured the needed funding.Musk subsequently settled a U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission SEC complaint alleging he knowingly misled investors with the tweet by paying a 20 million fine along with the same penalty for Tesla and agreeing to let Tesla s lawyers approve tweets with material corporate information before posting.In March 2022 Musk filed a court motion to overturn the consent decree stemming from that case.In April 2022 during a live TED Talk Musk called the SEC regulators on the case bastards. During his May 8 2021 appearance on the TV showSaturday Night Live Musk revealed that he has Asperger s syndrome an autism spectrum disorder. I m actually making history tonight as the first person with Asperger s to hostSNL. Or at least the first to admit it he said. How does the neurodevelopment condition manifest itself I don t always have a lot of intonation or variation in how I speak which I m told makes for great comedy Musk explained.Is Elon Musk Married Elon Musk has been divorced three times twice from his second wife Talulah Riley.From 2018 to 2022 he had been in a relationship with Canadian singer songwriter Claire Elise Boucher professionally known as Grimes with whom he had a son in 2020 and a daughter in 2022.

Subject Of A Fictional Movie Character A Weird Relevance In Exactly The Current Moment Director SaysbyChris Katje Benzinga Staff WriterDecember 27 2022 2 58 PM 3 min readZinger Key PointsA fictional character in Glass Onion A Knives Out Mystery may be inspired by Elon Musk.Musk was also used as inspiration for a character in Don t Look Up. A 2022 movie debuted on streaming platformNetflix IncNFLXthat may have usedTesla IncTSLACEOElon Muskas inspiration for a character. Here s what investors fans of Musk and movie lovers should know.What Happened The Netflix movie Glass Onion A Knives Out Mystery featured a character that might resemble Musk and be related to his acquisition ofsocial media platform Twitter.The character Miles Bron is a technology billionaire who has interests in space exploration and automotives two sectors Musk had disrupted in real life. Played byEdward Nortonin the movie Bron was portrayed as someone who stole ideas and took credit for items he wasn t behind.Movie directorRian Johnsonrecently shared withWiredthat Musk might have been an inspiration for the character.Johnson told Wired he wrote the screenplay during COVID 19 lockdowns prior to Musk announcing plans to purchase Twitter. The movie director joked he didn t know about this ahead of time but viewers could see parallels between the behavior of the tech billionaires both fictional and in real life. It s so weird. It s very bizarre. I hope there isn t some secret marketing department at Netflix that s funding this Twitter takeover Johnson said.The character of Miles Bron took its characterization from Musk and also other tech billionaires according to Johnson. There s a lot of general stuff about that sort of species of tech billionaire that went directly into it. But obviously it has almost a weird relevance in exactly the current moment. The interviewer joked the next Knives Out movie could be about the downfall of Twitter. Downfall of Twitter. Didn t I just do that Johnson jokingly replied.Related Link Access To The World s Richest Man Biographer Shares Preview Of Highly Anticipated Biography Of Elon MuskWhy It s Important Musk is the CEO of Tesla but his role as co founder of the companyhas been controversial. Discussion in the movie of ideas and companies that the entrepreneur took credit for could have parallels with how some viewed Musk in real life. Glass Onion A Knives Out Mystery played in U.S. movie theatersAMC Entertainment Holdings IncAMC Cinemark Holdings Inc.CNKandRegalfor one week to become the first streaming movie to debut at all three theater chains.The movie was added to Netflix on Dec. 23 and now available for all subscribers of the streaming platform.News of a movie character being based loosely on tech billionaires such as Musk followed the Netflix hit Don t Look Up which alsodrew inspiration fromsome big names.The character Peter Isherwell is played by actorMark Rylance who noted he studied Musk Steve Jobs Mark ZuckerbergandJeff Bezosfor his physical appearance and portrayal. I looked at all those fellas. Maybe I should have gone down that more Californian high tech thing. But I went for something slightly different. I did read Elon Musk s book about half of it Rylance said.Musk was a major spark for the character and Rylance said people such as the Tesla CEO have high minded ideas and could look dangerous. I certainly thought a lot about that mindset of men and technology being the greatest thing in the universe that nothing else is a higher force and anything that nature throws at us we ll deal with it. You get this impression with Elon Musk. They think they re going to save humanity. I think they re dangerous. While Musk had been an inspiration for several fictional movie characters he could find himself the subject of a future movie himself.

 Once My Album The Kindness Of The High Prince He Gives Us Fast Trains Comes Out People Will Understand What I See In Elon Musk 5 Questions With Grimes ClickHolePress Enter to skip to contentSearchSearch ClickHoleopen menuBackLatestNewsPop CultureLifestyleQuizzesClickVenturesVideoKidHoleEmail ClubStore5 Questions Once My Album The Kindness Of The High Prince He Gives Us Fast Trains Comes Out People Will Understand What I See In Elon Musk 5 Questions With GrimesJune 26 2018A self taught musician and visual artist Grimes has spent almost a decade capturing fans hearts with her eclectic experimental sound. After recent issues with her original record label 4AD Grimes has continued to make music collaborating with artists like Janelle Mon e and working on a fifth yet to be titled studio album. We sat down with the beloved alternative artist to ask about her experience in the music industry her visual art and her high profile relationship with billionaire Elon Musk.1. You ve been critical of the male dominated pop music production system. Can you give us your thoughts on that Absolutely. Given the current skewed industry ratio all you hear on the radio are pop songs about sex money and beautiful women. I m tired of that I want to hear more songs about hair braiding bed sheet thread counts and flushing sanitary napkins down toilets even though you know you re not supposed to.2. Along with being a musician you re also a very accomplished visual artist and you ve done the cover design on each one of your albums. Do you find that being involved in the visual design of an album is important in achieving the aesthetic you want Not really. I mainly do my own design work because I know that if I don t my friend who studied graphic design in college will offer to do it and he s fucking terrible. Whenever I m coming out with a new album I have to tell him shit like I wouldn t let Picasso himself design my album art because only I know what I want it to look like but the truth is that I m just trying to let him down easy because he always picks the stupidest looking script fonts and has pretty much no idea how to cut things out in Photoshop. I d love to get another artist to contribute artwork for my albums but it would hurt my friend s feelings too much so I just design them myself.3. A lot of people have been critical of you an indie artist who frequently touts leftist stances dating Elon Musk a billionaire with a reputation for mistreating workers and busting unions. What is your response to that criticism I don t want to speak too much on that because I ve always liked to let my music do the talking for me but I will say that once my new album The Kindness Of The High Prince He Gives Us Fast Trains is released people will better understand where I m coming from. Once my critics hear the songs I m working on like An Unholy Union Find Your Own Bootstraps and You Don t Need A Bathroom Break When You Got A Bedpan I think they ll see that Elon s actually a really great guy who s doing important work.4. On a personal level are there any other downsides to dating a very famous tech billionaire It s not too bad. The only thing that sucks is when Elon holds me up in the air onstage at a tech conference claims that I m the new Tesla model Girlfriend and launches into a PowerPoint presentation about all my specs and features. Other than that it s pretty much like any other relationship.5. Your given name is Claire Elise Boucher. How did you come up with the stage name Grimes Grimes is a combination of Grieg which is the name of a Norwegian composer whose music was my favorite thing to listen to growing up and Sorry but our theater s no outside food policy extends even to your bag of fresh limes which was my least favorite thing to hear growing up. My art deals with joy as well as sorrow and I thought my name should be a reflection of that.Elon MuskEntertainmentGrimesMusicWowMore posts in5 Questions I Only Did A Rap For President Obama Because He Promised To Name Nevada After Me 5 Questions With Lin Manuel Miranda I Only Did A Rap For President Obama Because He Promised To Name Nevada After Me 5 Questions With Lin Manuel Miranda In Office I Only Ate 7 Almonds A Day.

Grimes s real name is Claire Boucher and she answers to Grimes or Claire or even better c as in the speed of light. But ever since she began dating the richest man in all of human civilization and especially since she had a child with him in May 2020 a boy they call X A 12 which she pronounces X A.I. Archangel or X for short she s had to learn to make peace with much of the world erasing her identity as one of the past decade s most fearless adventurous solo artists and coming to know her first and foremost as Elon Musk s girlfriend.For a person who has spent her entire life flinging herself at the world and making art out of the combustions her new existence has required some adjusting. Discretion does not come naturally to her. Last year someone posted a seven minute mash up on YouTube titled Grimes oversharing in interviews compilation. She has no filter what is in her mind comes out her mouth says Liv Boeree a former World Series of Poker star and trained astrophysicist whom Grimes met through Musk and fell madly in friendship with after a marathon chat about artificial intelligence. I find it so refreshing and exhilarating but obviously it causes her trouble. Once upon a time this was part of Grimes s charm but now an errant remark could follow her kid for life or crater Tesla s stock or tip off people about where she lives. Doxers and stalkers and paparazzi are nothing new for her she s a female pop star in 2022 but these are people trying to outmaneuver the guy who runs TeslaandSpaceX and founded the Boring Company and Neuralink . They track his private jet and post its location on Twitter. They swarm his factories with drones. Once they find him they find her soon enough and then they find X. We move and move and move she ll tell me later because people keep finding where we live. Grimes opens the front door wearing a double layered cream and black shirt made by a Korean designer friend s label with the wordalgorithmstitched in red on the collar and cuffs. She invites me in with a cheerful hello then apologizes for the spartan conditions. She s only just moved into this house which belongs to friends. X is with his father until tomorrow so the house is dim and silent.We settle into a cozy nook off the entryway the one room she s had time to Grimes up with some anime inspired decor she purchased during a wee hours Ambien fueled spree on Etsy. For the next four hours as she and I split a six pack of some local craft beer and get slowly buzzed because we re both lightweights Princess Mononoke glowers at me from a thin blanket behind her on the couch. Covering the floor is an enormousDeath Noterug based on a gory 2006 2007 Japanese anime TV series about a teenager who can dictate the time and manner of anyone s death by writing it down in a book. It s on Netflix. Death Noteis the chief inspiration for Grimes s recent single Shinigami Eyes as well as the video costarring her pal Jennie from Blackpink. I like making friends with demons Grimes chants in her demon baby singing voice. You need special eyes to see em. Grimes is an invigorating hang. Time flies around her in nonlinear fashion. Art and ideas are her power source and her energy is infectious. She speakssofast in a unique Esperanto of academic theory Silicon Valley 3.0 futurism and club kid slang. At one point she hops up to show me her new tattoo a series of milky white slashes on her upper torso meant to look like alien scars. Yet for someone who might be from another planet she s remarkably down to earth. For someone who s so excited about A.I. she sure does love the company of people.Clothing byLouis Vuitton sleeve byUrstadt.Swan rings byEgonlab.Throughout hair by Garren makeup by Kabuki manicure by Mei Kawajiri set design by Stefan Beckman.PHOTOGRAPHS BY STEVEN KLEIN. STYLED BY PATTI WILSON.About 15 minutes after we sit down to discuss her new music a space opera due this spring ish tentatively calledBook 1 I hear what sounds vaguely like a lone cry from an infant upstairs. I think I notice Grimes wince but I say nothing and move on. Could be anything.Another few minutes pass. Just as I m about to bring up one ofBook 1 s highlights a soon to be ubiquitous banger called Sci Fi that she cowrote with The Weeknd and his longtime producer Illangelo I hear it again. This time it s multiple cries and it s unmistakable. I ve got two kids. That s a baby. And I can tell by the frozen look on my host s face that she heard it too. So I brace myself to ask the strangest question of my career Do you have another baby in your life Grimes Her body clenches and she looks away. I m not at liberty to speak on these things she begins and then all in a tumble she says Whatever is going on with family stuff I just feel like kids need to stay out of it and X is just out there. I mean I think E is really seeing him as a prot g and bringing him to everything and stuff. X is out there. His situation is like that. But yeah I don t know. She s rattled and I m mortified by even accidentally making a woman a new mother no less feel exposed and vulnerable. I suggest we pause for a moment to discuss the surreal professional ethics at play which are that I can t pretend I don t know she s got a secret baby with the world s wealthiest man hiding upstairs. Especially when she invited me here. It s a calming period that breaks with a sitcom punch line full blown infant screams upstairs followed by the voice of a woman pleadingSHH.Now we both start laughing.Did she really think I wasn t going to hear a baby Grimes just shakes her head. She s a little colicky too. She laughs again and buries her face in her hands. I don t know. I don t know what I was thinking. Congratulations to Grimes and Elon Musk on the birth of their second child together It s a girl You probably have some questions.When Grimes waspregnant with X in 2020 she had a clear sense of the boy he d turn out to be. I just had a vibe she says. I was like I feel like he s going to be a peaceful giant. She was right.Grimes meanwhile used to get called waifish so often in profiles that she railed against it in a viral 2013 Tumblr post. The last month of her pregnancy with X she couldn t walk. He was pressing on my nerves so I kept collapsing she says. I took a few steps and collapsed. It was kind of scary because you don t want to fall a lot when you re eight months pregnant. So I would just crawl to the bathroom and crawl back or whatever. At one point during the pregnancy she thought she was dying. Like I hemorrhaged. It was scary. She and Musk wanted more kids but she feared serious complications.Last fall though Musk appeared to confirm rumors that they d split up. Grimes and I are I d say probably semi separated he toldTime which named him its 2021 Person of the Year. He chalked this up to busy careers in distant cities. He was spending more time in Texas where SpaceX operates its Starbase complex and Tesla is opening a new Gigafactory. Grimes was bunkered in Los Angeles with X and working onBook 1.Around the time of her daughter s birth in December though she relocated full time to Austin and that s where I m meeting her on a sleepy neighborhood cul de sac 15 minutes from downtown less than an hour by private jet from Starbase and a short drive from the Tesla factory.Close followers of Grimes on social media may recall that she was definitely not pregnant during the latter months of 2021. She and Musk used a surrogate this time which in combination with the pandemic enabled them to keep their daughter a secret right up until Y shared the news just now on her own.That s what they call her by the way Y. She s got a full name but this doesn t seem like the moment to ask for it. If today s excitement turns out to be how the world learns that X has a little sister well at least Grimes did it her way.Coat byLuis de Javier gown byVersace shoes bySaint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello headpiece byKeko Hainswheeler rings byAshenlightandLory Sun Artistry.PHOTOGRAPHS BY STEVEN KLEIN. STYLED BY PATTI WILSON.So wait are Grimesand Musk still together Yes. No. What do you mean by together There s no real word for it she begins. I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend but we re very fluid. We live in separate houses. We re best friends. We see each other all the time . We just have our own thing going on and I don t expect other people to understand it. What matters I offer is that they re happy. So are they Yeah she says. This is the best it s ever been.... We just need to be free. They plan to have more children too. We ve always wanted at least three or four. Grimes was a musical autodidact who went viral in 2010 with some of the very first songs she made on GarageBand then spent a decade creating every single note in a male dominated industry no matter how much unrequested help men kept offering. She connected with Musk through Twitter in 2018 which is how he discovered they d made the same pun about a dark theory of A.I. authorized torture called Roko s basilisk. He tweeted Rococo basilisk years earlier she d made a music video featuring a character called Rococo Basilisk. While the world was huddled indoors Tesla took off like a BFR that s an inside joke for the SpaceX junkies in the house sending Musk s net worth into the stratosphere and he seemed to delight in provoking his trolls. For Grimes the dent to her reputation has been real. Overnight a chunk of her core constituency the internet turned on her. She was no longer a revolutionary. She was Marie Antoinette.Grimes s song Kill v. Maim is the perfect crash course on her music just your garden variety pop disquisition on the inexorable pull towardbrutality and chaos.Decades from now it ll still sound like a revolution. I feel really trapped between two worlds Grimes tells me. I used to be so far left that I went through a period of living without currency living outside. This was during and after college at McGill University in Montreal. Once she and a boyfriend ran afoul of the police in Minnesota as they tried to sail a houseboat they d built out of actual junk down the Mississippi River. The police impounded the boat and sent them on their way. During her first shows as Grimes she d sleep in a tent when she couldn t afford a hotel. She s 34 now though with a job and two kids. I mean when people say I m a class traitor that is not an inaccurate description she admits. I was deeply from the far left and I converted to being essentially a capitalist Democrat. A lot of people are understandably upset. We re approaching hour three of talking and beer three. Y is sound asleep upstairs. But at the same time I can physically observe her brain cells sayingscrew it. Like bro wouldn t even get a new mattress. This was back when they were both living in Los Angeles. Her side of the mattress had a hole in it. When she raised the issue he suggested they replace his mattress with the one at her house. The mattresses are fine now. Still Bro doesnotlive like a billionaire. Bro lives at times below the poverty line. To the point where I was like can wenotlive in a very insecure 40 000 house Where the neighbors like film us and there s no security and I m eating peanut butter for eight days in a row She is well aware that many see Musk as some embodiment of luxurious excess and Grimes is here to tell you she fuckin wishes.This home in Austin could be any house in any upscale neighborhood. It s got a gorgeous view of the Colorado River in the back and a tiny pool that she has no plans to use because she s not a big fan of sun. It s a nice house. It s no Versailles. I m not super into amenities she says. But um I need nutrition and stuff. Grimes often describesher music as post internet because the entire history of sound is just a click away from Nine Inch Nails to Hildegard von Bingen s 12th century chanting and Stravinsky to Mariah Carey s daunting octaves ready for her to pluck bend shape and morph. If you fall into the category of people who d never heard of her until she met Musk 2015 s Kill V. Maim one of the biggest hits off her fourth album Art Angels is the perfect four minute crash course. It s a pulsing menacing dance punk rager told from the perspective of Michael Corleone inThe Godfather Part II only in the Grimes remix he s a genderfluid vampire wrestling with a moral conundrum. Just your garden variety pop disquisition on the nature of man and the inexorable pull toward brutality and chaos. Kill V. Maim has been streamed 72 million times on Spotify alone. Decades from now it ll still sound like a revolution.Book 1remains a work in progress but the 15 songs Grimes has got so far represent her most audacious work yet each song its own planet of sound crisp California pop club shakers arena anthems ethereal requiems fairycore. The album takes place in the distant future at a stage of technological advancement when you can upload your consciousness into a robotic body and essentially live forever as a Cymek in the parlance of science fiction aficionados. I feel like Jeff Bezos is gonna be a Cymek says Grimes. Her space opera s antihero is a Cymek she calls the dark king the world s greatest engineer whom Grimes featured in the video for her recent single Player of Games. By the time our story begins he s pushing 10 000.Grimes is still hammering out the plot but one key thread is a kind of cyberpunk spin onSwan Lake.There s a white swan an exaggerated version of Grimes the dark king s dream girl a simulated courtesan who grows weary of being a muse and there s a black swan an A.I. menace who wreaks havoc in the simulation except in Grimes s feminist reboot the swans ditch the Cymek fall in love and fight for each other instead. From there it gets kind of complicated. Despite all my rage I am still just a doll in a cage she sings paying homage to Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins heroes of her wilding teens.Clothing and headpiece byAziz Rebar sleeve byUrstadt .Swan rings byAshenlightandEgonlab.PHOTOGRAPHS BY STEVEN KLEIN. STYLED BY PATTI WILSON.Book 1is Grimes sMellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness with a hint ofLemonade and it was partly inspired by a theory of Musk s that she s a simulation. We keep having this conversation where E s like Are you real Or are we living in my memory and you re like a synthesized companion that was created to be my companion here If this sounds like he s asking her if she s a virtual pleasure bot that s not entirely what he means. Anyway she says she s never felt entirely real herself The degree to which I feel engineered to have been this like perfect companion is crazy. Does she mean the perfect companion forhimspecifically Yes. Even just studying astrophysics and neuroscience. And it s really annoying because people think I m an airhead who went to art school. She actually wanted to but it was too expensive. A conversation with Grimes can be like staring at a Tokyo subway map when you don t speak Japanese. She s always using scientific terms and alluding to heady concepts then checking with me to make sure I know what they mean because usually I do not. If there s an airhead in this room it s not her. Do you know what a protopia is No. A state of gradual progress toward utopia. Effective altruism I mean I know what those words mean. Using data analysis to maximize resource deployment to help others. The Overton window I thought so but I looked it up while she was in the bathroom and I was wrong. The spectrum of accepted discourse and achievable ideas. What about neuroplasticity Now I m worried she just thinks I m stupid.Grimes was raised as a strict Catholic which she struggled with though she loved the spectacle of church. The Old Testament was like an ultraviolent blockbuster. Biblical manga. She spent year one of the pandemic taking care of X and plunging down a rabbit hole of Homer Herodotus theAnglo Saxon Chronicle the Icelandic sagas. An idea began to form a space opera about the galaxy altering events unfolding before her eyes in which she has become an unwitting participant. A love story about some epic stuff. The future of civilization. Simulated protopia. The dawn of creative A.I. Terraforming Mars. Here was a golden opportunity to pry open that Overton window Grimes style. The idea of the female Herodotus she says almost doesn t exist. Grimes isn t just the narrator though. She s also a principal character and over the course of written history her archetype the lover the siren the mistress hasn t been treated with much respect.Book 1alludes to Athena Calypso Persephone the black swan Anne Boleyn courtesans concubines geishas. These weren t just hot girls she says. They were the smartest girls some of the most educated women of their time. They painted sang designed their own clothing. They were the Grimeses of their day.And then they got written into history as some rich guy s sidepiece. I ate my cake I lost my head Villain of the internet Grimes sings on a Police inflected track fromBook 1called Marie Antoinette 2077. I m super inspired by the way women get pulled into orbits in this manner she tells me. There s this weird dismissal of them. These are some of the most interesting characters in history to me and they re so demeaned . I feel like the most radical thing I could do right now is just become Marie Antoinette. She considers it for a second. Infamy is kind of fun. Grimes says Musk often wonders if she s a simulation. E s like Are you real Or are we living in my memory and you re like asynthesized companion She quickly adds that she doesn t want this to become all about Musk. She says it often during our conversations and she s referring to this article but she could just as easily be referring to her life. The culture took sides on Grimes from the moment the couple appeared at the Met gala in 2018 their incongruous outfits her looking like an interstellar Elvira him wearing a prim white jacket became an instant mismatch meme. Her Instagram mentions turned into a cesspool. She d go on social media and defend herself. Guess how that went. It killed me at first she says now. I spent 10 years fucking producing writing engineering every single fucking thing on my own. And I fucking proved myself. Her friends are still furious on her behalf more for the erasing than the hating. It frustrates me because she sasbrilliant as him says Boeree. When I see her referred to as the significant other of another person it s like Oh come on. Over the years Grimes has slyly rebelled. She let the paparazzi catch her in aDune inspired bodysuit and leggings while ostentatiously readingThe Communist Manifesto.She lampooned her cyber nymph persona by posting her self care regimen on Instagram. I spend 2 4 hours in my deprivation tank this allows me to astro glide to other dimensions past present and future. About half of the pop culture galaxy thought she was serious. Until the day she dies on Mars legitimate media outlets will be reporting that she had experimental surgery to remove blue light from her visual spectrum.In other words rebellion didn t work.Grimes also started to feel unexpectedly conflicted about her role in this theater. For one thing shelikedbeing Musk s girlfriend. She knows she s going to get slaughtered for saying this but Personally I don t think manic pixie dream girl is an insult. I exactly identify with all of those terms. I understand it s supposed to be a critique of certain things but then I challenge that critique. She began to reject what she calls this misplaced idea of feminism of like I need to be my own thing I need to be separate. She has kids with Musk. Separate is off the table for good. There is no way to extricate myself she says now. So she did what artists do She turned her gilded cage into source material.According to herlittle brother Mac the Bouchers childhood in Vancouver was likeStranger Thingsminus the Demogorgon. Kids in nearly every house on the street. Secret clubs in the basement. Bikes. Vancouver is also a port city though with lots of crime and pretty much every drug that enters Canada. By high school they had more or less graduated fromStranger ThingstoEuphoria. I was like a mix of Jules and Rue Grimes says referring to theEuphoriacharacters played by Hunter Schafer and Zendaya respectively. That sounds about right says Mac.In other words she was a hyper smart thrill seeking gender exploring time bomb whose hobbies included rejecting capitalism partying too hard and dancing until sunrise though Mac notes she was also an overachieving straight A student politically radical and deeply involved with what was then called the Gay Straight Alliance. She tried LSD for the first time when she was 13 and has lost multiple friends to opiate overdoses. She would pay for drugs by doing homework for Taiwanese loan sharks. Mac who is two years younger got involved in sports instead and he sounds almost amazed thathewas the younger sibling. She was always doing what he calls dumb Claire shit. He asks if she told me about the houseboat. Yes she did. That was one of the first adult choices she made. TheEuphoriaphase was less about defiance Grimes says and more about DNA particularly that of her grandfather on her father s side whom she describes as crazy and jarringly unwoke. My grandpa is hard as fuck she says. He grew up in poverty. Super antiestablishment. Teach yourself. Don t rely on other people to teach you anything. She says he taught her how to shoot guns when she was six. Grimes s parents divorced when she was around 11 and her mother married a man with two sons bringing her brother count to four. Her grandpa nursed her competitive fire.You gonna let your brothers defeat you Being outnumbered by the boys has never phased her since. She says he taught her to drive a standard transmission by instructing her to reverse the car to the edge of a cliff. If she lets the car roll backward she says recalling it now we re literally going to die. She won t be forcing teenage X to pop a clutch or die trying. He ll be in a self driving Tesla presumably. And anyway she won t have to thrust X and Y into brutal tests of their mettle. Just being the children of Grimes and Elon Musk will be enough of a barrage and the shields never seem to hold. It s going to be hard for them she says in a different way. Grimes s grandfather is still alive and still lives like a hermit in remote British Columbia. Once he gave her some professional feedback You really need to sex it up. You should be more like Miley Cyrus. He was like Your career is going to be way better if you start showing more skin she recalls. I was like Grandpa. Dress byLouis Vuitton rings byAshenlightandVitaly.PHOTOGRAPHS BY STEVEN KLEIN. STYLED BY PATTI WILSON.Grimes s first recordwas aDune inspired concept album calledGeidi Primes a reference to the militaristic planet ruled in the recent movie by an enormous Stellan Skarsg rd. She dubbed herself Grimes because MySpace allowed her to associate herself with three musical genres and she liked the name grime then a nascent British music scene. Her father read Frank Herbert s book to her when she was four. She loved it. At one Met gala she cornered Sting who starred in David Lynch s much derided adaptation and freaked him out with a heavy dose ofDunefangirling.For years Grimes harbored a dream of directing her own adaptation ofDune with the more problematic colonialist elements scrubbed out but when she heard about Denis Villeneuve s two part blockbuster she fangirled all over again and signed on to help with the rollout originally scheduled for November 2020. I was basically an influencer. And then she adds she got canceled fromDunebecause of theCommunist Manifestothing. She was crestfallen but she understood. There are things that are deeply not woke in theDuneuniverse she says so the studio had to be extra cautious and she was far from indispensable.When she finally saw the movie she realized to her astonishment that this story she d adored since she was far too young for it that she knew almost by heart that inspired her first album this story was now her story. Specifically Lady Jessica s story. This goes by fast onscreen but Jessica played by Rebecca Ferguson is not a wife but a concubine. Grimes saw herself in Jessica and she saw X in Jessica s son Paul Atreides Timoth e Chalamet . Paul is more than a duke s son. He s a chosen one tasked with becoming a great leader. When I see X she says like I just know X is going to have to go through all this really fucked up shit that sort of mirrors Paul type stuff. Watching it wrecked her. I was just crying my eyes out the whole movie. She knows this might sound absurd. Grandiose. She wishes it felt that way to her too. I feel like there s very few people in the world who could have similar sentiments about their son than Claire with X Mac says when I relay this to him. I ask if it s surreal to watch his sister live this life. Yes he says laughing. But I m also not really surprised Because she somehow always gets into the most insane possible scenarios. By the summerof 2019 Grimes was in the early days of her romance with Musk and getting canceled online for it and she was also finishingMiss Anthropocene her long long awaited follow up toArt Angels all while her longtime manager and closest daily confidant was dying of cancer. Her life she says has always been level 10 chaos. This was level 11. She d been making everything by herself for a decade and she was sick of it.She needed to figure out a new way to be an artist which meant figuring out a new way to make money being an artist. I hate touring and I hate selling merch she told her new manager Daouda Leonard during their first FaceTime call. He laughs at the memory. If you know anything about being a manager in the music industry. At this point most managers would have hung up. Instead he said Cool you re going to tour in the metaverse and you re gonna sell digital assets digital goods. Okay. Problem solved. They got to work creating an avatar of her body dubbed WarNymph and in February 2021 Grimes became among the first musicians to sell an NFT collection of digital artwork some with accompanying music. Mac s idea. She generated 6 million from that one drop more than she s ever made from any of her albums. They engineered a deepfake of her voice that she plans to release with other IP inside metaverse experiences and gaming platforms like The Sandbox a sort of open source creative experiment. Look at fan fic she says. So much inventive stuff is happening there if you know where to look. She has similar plans for an A.I. girl group she s designing named NPC which is gamer speak for nonplayer character. She puts the A.I. girl group out into the world you go make something with it. Personally I don t think manic pixie dream girl is an insult. I exactly identify with all of those terms. I understand it s supposed to be a critique of certain things but thenI challenge that critique. The NFT project was so lucrative that if it had happened two weeks earlier Grimes says she might not have signed her first major label deal with Columbia Records. No shots at Columbia she adds they ve been great but she only did it to pay for the ambitious videos she had in mind. The one for Shinigami Eyes a futuristic dance pop phantasmagoria was among the first music videos filmed on an extended reality xR stage similar to what was used to makeTheMandalorian.Of course signing with a major label was considered yet another betrayal by the Grimes purists but where they see a sellout she sees creative liberation. You sign with a label any label of any size for money which you can either put into your pocket or plow back into the mission.The foot trafficis heavier the next afternoon when I return to Grimes s house including little X. He arrives about 30 minutes after his mom and I have settled back into the anime nook and as he charges through the door she leaps to her feet with a delighted yelp. He says a friendly hi to me and later makes a bid for her laptop so he can watchMy Neighbor Totoro Miyazaki s classic with the giant Catbus.In solidarity with all the new moms out there Grimes is wearing the same outfit as yesterday. She hasn t touched her makeup. Respect. While she gets X on his way for a playdate I take in the view of the Colorado River from the living room. I look down and see a neat pile of picture books and at the bottom Time s Person of the Year issue with X s father on the cover. The room is dominated by a massive red couch shaped like a giant Tootsie Roll and it looks amazingly comfortable but the kids have done a number on it possibly both numbers so Grimes sits cross legged on the floor instead and we discuss the Elephant of the Year in the room. We live in this society right now where people expect everyone to behave right and talk right she begins. You have these manifestations of genius but then you want them to behave normally but the reason they re like that is because they re so disconnected from correct behavior. Humans are beautiful and toxic in equal supply she says. Like we fuck up. We re all gonna do bad things in our life. We re all gonna do stupid things. She s talking about Musk but once again she could be talking about herself. They re both such deeply original thinkers says Liv Boeree whom Grimes drafted to costar as her black swan in the video for aBook 1track called 100 Tragedy. The lines blur with them about whether it s even art versus engineering or science because really we re talking about creating something that does not exist.

STYLED BY PATTI WILSON.From the moment they stepped out at the Met gala every PR mess Musk created calling an explorer who helped in the Thailand cave rescue a pedo guy tweeting that pronouns suck which elicited a pained now deleted reply from Grimes referring to Elizabeth Warren as Senator Karen has turned into a referendum on Grimes. When you hate me think it fixes you to break me she sings onBook 1. I ll never fight you back because everything you hate is everything I love. Grimes can get far more wound up on Musk s behalf than her own but one thing that really pisses her off is how many people think that she surrendered her agency to him. They took her silence for complicity rather than how she viewed her silence which was not submitting to their sexist horseshit. Why should she have to respond to every scandalous thing he says You don t think he drives her crazy too sometimes Have you ever been in a relationship Again she doesn t want this to become all about Musk but she wishes his progressive haters would show some respect for the work for actually accomplishingtheirgoals. He s done more than any other private citizen to wean the planet off fossil fuels. He helped protect internet service in Ukraine by making his Starlink satellite terminals available. And Grimes is baffled that so many people view his Mars ambition as some billionaire s boondoggle rather than the essence of being human and maybe just maybe the key to our survival. The Mars project is hard she says. There s no income for it. There s no way for it to make money. You can t make money after all without customers. It s for the benefit of humanity and it s dangerous and it s expensive and people are like He s hoarding money No he s spending everything on R D. She knows she can sound too admiring and she knows it ll get her mocked. Screw it. Bro might say a lot of stupid shit she says finally but he does the right thing. In the daysafter I return home from Austin I settle into a new morning routine Wake up check my phone and read the texts that Grimes sent the night before at around 2 a.m. She s as nocturnal as ever. I would literally die for a time machine but especially for like pre civ type stuff she writes during an exchange about the earliest known tattoos. Like man it must have been HARD. The aesthetics of that time r just like next level like haha they had insanely good style. She sends a photo she found online. Like this girl looks like she s dressed in Yeezy. She gives me fun assignments then checks to see if I ve done them. Did u read the omegas short story at the beginning of life 3.0 by Max tegmark yet I did. Mind blown emoji. One morning I wake to a text about Musk. Hahaha e says he ll do an interview with you surprisingly. A week later shortly before midnight on a Friday Grimes calls from Musk s Tesla and puts them on speakerphone. It s date night. They ve got a sitter for X and Y and they re going to the movies an early cut of dailies by a director friend. We ve got 12 minutes to talk. Musk is in the driver s seat letting the car do the driving and Grimes is refreshing his memory about the chorus to Player of Games which dropped in December and is more or less about him If I loved him any less I d make him stay but he has to be the best player of games. Musk agrees thatliving separatelyis wise I just don t like things to bemessy and anime. I wouldn t say Ihaveto be the best player of games Musk says. He thinks the guy in the song sounds somewhat overwrought. Grimes concedes a bit of dramatic license but it rhymes well. He does like strategy games an awful lot though and she asks for permission to share that he has the top score on a popular civilization building game called The Battle of Polytopia which Musk describes as a much more complex version of chess. He s even bested Polytopia s creator Felix Ekenstam. I literally beat him at his own game Musk says. He s also lost a bunch to Ekenstam too. Grimes and Musk agree that living separately is wise. They re just too different on the basic stuff. He likes things reasonably neat. She likes to be able to see everything she owns all at once. He likes quality design clean aesthetics. She likesDeath Noterugs from Etsy. You did have that cool vintage JapaneseMetropolisposter for a bit Grimes points out. That was yours. Oh yeah she says. True. As the Tesla beeps and begins to park itself Musk sums up his position I just don t like things to be messy and anime. When Player of Games first dropped Grimes s fans assumed it was about her rumored split from Musk when in fact they were welcoming their second child and spending the holidays together as a family. The idea for the song came to her during a conversation with friends two years ago while she was three or four months pregnant with X when Musk casually mentioned that he planned to depart for Mars in 10 years. She froze. I was like Uhhh . She remembers laughing nervously. I said Could we make it 20 It wasn t new information Musk says in the car lightly protesting when I bring this up. I ve been saying since before she was pregnant that I was going to Mars. Sure she replies but I didn t know you were going like this soon. She is still trying to convince Musk to stick around longer but either way she came out of it with a killer song for her space opera. Player of Games isn t about their breakup. It s about going into space sort of . For most parents even 20 years from now would be too soon. Not for Grimes. The thing is I fuckin live and die by the mission. I believe in the mission. She d used that phrase often the mission and gradually I realized it was a proper noun. UppercaseM.When I asked what she meant by it she replied without hesitation Sustainable energy multiplanetary species. The preservation of consciousness. Last March Grimes wrote on Instagram that she was ready to die with the red dirt of Mars beneath my feet. Now she talks as though it s a fait accompli. I will probably go when I m like 65 or so she tells me the same way you might say it s always been your dream to visit the Galapagos. Hard to reach probably out of your price range but doable in theory.Skirt belt headpiece bracelet and flag byGareth Pugh sleeves byUrstadt .Swan lip cuff byGregory Kara rings bySho Konishi.Throughout hair products byR Co Bleu makeup products byChanel nail enamel byDior Vernis.PHOTOGRAPHS BY STEVEN KLEIN. STYLED BY PATTI WILSON.She tells me she s worried she came off ranty and cynical the previous day when in reality she s closer to a pure idealist. This extends to A.I. she says. Why is everyone so gloomy about our cybernetic future What if A.I.likeshumanity What if it winds up being all of our creative best and none of our violent worst What wouldthatlook like I suggest later via text that her proverbial glass is 60 percent full and she replies Im glass 90 full. Martian travel she argues is just another Overton window conversation. Airplanes have existed for just over a century. The space program was fighting for survival a decade ago. And yetMichael Strahan an ex NFL star turned morning show fixture went to space last December. She snorts at the idea though of Mars as space tourism for the 0.1 percent There s not gonna be any makeup or Postmates. It s definitely gonna suck. And definitely early death for sure. Either way she s volunteering. I d rather die trying to do something impossible and maybe failing she says than just keep releasing cute pop songs. In the meantime Grimes gets to turn the whole experience into art and her kids get a digital age version of Jedi training. When Musk and Grimes first met he was Tony Stark and she was his kooky Pepper Potts. Now their domestic life is more like the Incredibles. Her role with X she says is handling his creative stuff. She s ready to start him on Ableton Live the digital audio software and she s taken him to his first rave though he left at 11 30 p.m.Grimes has grown semi comfortable with Musk treating X like his little captain of industry but she says things will be different with their daughter. Quick story In 2016 when my own daughter was six I took her to her first concert Grimes opening for Florence the Machine at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The next night before the show the FBI warned Grimes that a stalker known to them was believed to have bought a ticket and could be in the audience. This was just days after Christina Grimmie a singer who rose to fame onThe Voice was murdered after a show by a deranged fan. Grimes played half her set that night through panic attacks then walked off.Suffice to say the public won t be seeing much of her daughter. The best situation here she says is me training the girl and him Musk training the boy. Y s face maybe off limits to the outside world but since date night with Musk Grimes has been mulling whether to share her daughter s full name. She knows it ll surface eventually and also she s proud of it. It s fire she texts on Sunday night. Screw it she decides. She ll do it her way. Her full name she writes is Exa Dark Sider l Musk. Exa is a reference to the supercomputing term exaFLOPS the ability to perform 1 quintillion floating point operations per second . Dark meanwhile is the unknown. People fear it but truly it s the absence of photons. Dark matter is the beautiful mystery of our universe. She texts me a voice memo with the pronunciation of Sider l sigh deer ee el which she calls a more elven spelling ofsidereal the true time of the universe star time deep space time not our relative earth time. It s also a nod to her favoriteLord of the Ringscharacter the powerful Galadriel who chooses to abdicate the ring. From the Archive Elon Musk s Future ShockArrowGrimes is prepared for Y to dislike her name or get tired of it Grimes got tired of Claire a long time ago and if she ever decides to change it her mother will be first in line to help her choose a new one. She s already got dozens of ideas. She might even change it herself before this article comes out. In addition to Y she and Musk occasionally call her Sailor Mars a nod to theSailor Moonmanga series. Exa Dark Sider l was actually something of a compromise and she worries it s a little boring. I was fighting for Odysseus Musk she writes. A girl named Odysseus is my dream. We speak oncemore by phone on the eve of Lunar New Year and discuss Mars again. I apologize to her for the cheesiness of what I m about to ask When you imagine your future life on Mars is Elon there Is he with you Are you doing it together Hopefully she says then goes quiet for a few moments. She hasn t considered this before. Wow. Wow. Because yeah you re right he ll probably go and then I ll come later. Wow. Mars would still be a brutal place to live it d still suck but at least E andcwould be together smashing that Overton window to bits. And if X and Y want to join their parents they would have a free ticket waiting for them. The rocket ships would depart in synchrony with the narrow window every two years when Earth s orbit is the shortest distance from the red planet tens of millions of miles away. Grimes can see it in her mind s eye now them together on Mars one big happy thermonuclear family. Maybe it really is all just a simulation but it still makes her smile.TAILORS LUCY FALCK AND ALEXANDER KOUTNY. PRODUCED ON LOCATION BY THAT ONE PRODUCTION.

It s very difficult to start companies and quite painful Musk oncetolda group of students visiting SpaceX. Being an entrepreneur whose life goal is to save the human race and rocket it to Mars sounds painful indeed. It s not going to optimize your leisure time. No not when you run your own company let alone three. There s no time to unwind and lick your wounds.But hey if you work glass eating hard make the best of it and whistle while you work. Musk does.

He shared this odd batch of surprising licks on Los Angeles public radio station KCRW a few years back when heguest DJed. But first a warning Two of them aren t exactly safe for work well not maybe not unless you work at SpaceX Tesla or SolarCity. Fly Me to the Moon Frank SinatraWhy it inspires Musk in his own words I like the sense of possibility and it s really inspiring. And I d really like to fly to the moon. You know obviously I own a space company I m going to tend to like something that involves flying to the moon. You hear this song and it sounds like it s really going to happen. Related 7 Takeaways in the Success of Elon Musk for Young Entrepreneurs Always Look on the Bright Side of Life Monty PythonWhy it inspires Musk in his own words It s from the Monty Python film Life of Brianand obviously it s a pretty funny song because the characters are being crucified at the time. But I think it is a good reminder not to get focused on the negative things in life. And my personal philosophy is I d rather be optimistic and wrong rather than pessimistic and right. America F ck Yeah Team America World PoliceWhy it inspires Musk in his own words That is from the movie Team America. I m a big fan ofSouth Park. The shows that I watch South Park Daily ShowandColbert Report those are sort of my main three ones they just capture a little bit of essence of America in both a good and a bad way.

It s an incredibly beautiful song sung really beautifully so I think that s why it makes me feel that way about the world.

I don t even realize I m whistling it. I just go into auto whistle and this one comes up more than any other so I must like it at a subconscious level but I m not entirely sure why. I could guess. It s sort of a positive song. I mean who doesn t like Santa Claus I guess it s good to have him come to town. Oh and one more for the list while we re at it.

Andrew Harrer Bloomberg Comment on this storyCommentGiftArticleShareEven tech billionaires occasionally get tripped up by the rules. In the case of Tesla chief executive Elon Musk he may need to rethink the name of his new baby boy X A 12.Musk announced Monday that he and his girlfriend singer Grimes had welcomed a baby son and given it a name that he broke down how to correctly pronounceduring an interviewwith podcast host Joe Rogan this week. He identified the second character as ash saying it was pronounced X Ash A 12.Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter.ArrowRightBut California where Musk lives allows only the 26 English letters of the alphabet to be used on birth certificates along with a limited list of special characters including apostrophes hyphens and periods. That means no numbers or symbols.It s unclear if Musk will need to change the baby s name or if the couple may have used a completely different name on the legal birth certificate. Already Twitter is blowing up with theories on whether Musk is playing games by announcing the name.AdvertisementTesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.It s not the first time a tech founder billionaire s ability to think big and buck the rules has landed them in conflict with local state and even federal regulations. It s part of the culture of Silicon Valley to move fast and break things an early Facebook motto that has become embedded in the way many start ups and their founders think.Elon Musk mobilizes tech elites behind reopening societyApple visionary Steve Jobs avoided having a license plate on the back of his Mercedes taking advantage of a now closed loophole but it required him to replace the car every six months. Facebook s Mark Zuckerbergtried to secure exclusive rights to landhe had bought in Hawaii an expensive move prompting backlash from residents that forced him to backtrack. And Sun Microsystems co founder and billionaire Vinod Khosla tried to close access to a popular California public beach after he bought a large parcel of land that included the only access road prompting a lawsuitfrom the state.AdvertisementMusk himself has previously landed in hot water for his brash behavior. The Securities and Exchange Commissionfined him and Teslaeach 20 million after he tweeted that he could take his company private for 420 a share. And a British cave explorer sued for defamation after Muskreferred to him as a pedo guy in a tweet a lawsuit the tech billionaire ultimately won.Recently he has beenpushing for an endto shelter in place orders during the coronavirus pandemic. Now he will bump up against California rules on names.X A 12 Musk Elon Musk elonmusk May 5 2020During the podcast interview Musk gave Grimes credit for thinking up most of the name but he said the A 12 was his contribution a nod to the Archangel 12 plane. The Lockheed A 12 was a precursor to the SR 71 which Musk called the coolest plane ever. Grimes also gave an interpretation of the name on Twitter writing that X is the unknown variable is her elven spelling meaning love or artificial intelligence and A 12 is indeed the Archangel 12. X the unknown variable my elven spelling of Ai love or Artificial intelligence A 12 precursor to SR 17 our favorite aircraft . No weapons no defenses just speed. Great in battle but non violent A Archangel my favorite song metal rat Grimes Grimezsz May 6 2020But the name has also prompted theories on Twitter namely that the name is pronounced Kyle. The reasoning X is the Greek letter Chi which has a K sound makes an ai sound and A 12 refers to L or the 12th letter of the alphabet.View Tweet on TwitterCommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleElon Musk and TwitterHAND CURATEDHow Elon Musk knocked Tesla s Full Self Driving off courseMarch 19 2023How Elon Musk knocked Tesla s Full Self Driving off courseMarch 19 2023At Elon Musk s brittle Twitter tweaks trigger massive outagesMarch 6 2023At Elon Musk s brittle Twitter tweaks trigger massive outagesMarch 6 2023Musk meets with GOP tech critics and Biden aides during D.C. visitJanuary 27 2023Musk meets with GOP tech critics and Biden aides during D.C. visitJanuary 27 2023View 3 more storiesView moreLoading...TOP STORIESThe DownloadStay up to date on the news from Silicon Valley and how to take back control of your data and devices.How to file your taxes without selling your soulJudge denies Elizabeth Holmes s appeal to stay out of prisonFBI says public phone chargers may put your data at risk What to knowRefreshTry a different topicSign inorcreate a free accountto save your preferencesCompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile AppsNewsletters AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints PermissionsPost StoreBooks E BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives Subscribers Only Today s PaperPublic NoticesContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com 1996 2023 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com 1996 2023 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices

The new CEO of Twitter is amazing Musk wrote. So much better than the other guy. A pair of follow up tweets showed Floki wearing a pair of glasses while climbing across his executive s desk and pawing through a spread of Twitter paperwork. He s great with numbers Musk wrote in one tweet adding And has style in another.The humorous tweets come as Musk told the World Government Summit conference in Dubai that a new CEO should be running Twitter and that he was likely to have one in place by the end of 2023.Speaking to the summit by video call Musk said it had been a rollercoaster since he took the reins at Twitter last year. I m guessing probably towards the end of this year should be good timing to find someone else to run the company he told the World Government Summit conference in Dubai via video. I need to stabilize the organization and make sure it s in a healthy place and that the product roadmap is clearly laid out... I think it should be in a stable position around the end of this year. Musk paid 44 billion for his favorite social media platform and exiting day to day operations would allow him to deflect criticism that he is neglecting his other ventures especially car company Tesla which has seen its share price plummet since he took over Twitter.Forbes estimates Musk s wealth at just under 200 billion. The Forbes analysis ranks Musk as the second wealthiest person on Earth just behind French luxury brand magnate Bernard Arnault.Tech billionaire Elon Musk tells the World Government Summit in Dubai that a new CEO might be running Twitter by the end of 2023 after a rollercoaster since he took full ownership of the online platform in OctoberUAE Minister of Cabinet Affairs Mohammad al Gergawi L on stage speaks with Elon Musk attending the World Government Summit virtually in Dubai on February 15 2023Elon Musk sits between Rupert and Elisabeth Murdoch as they watch the Kansas City Chiefs play the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII from a box in State Farm Stadium in Glendale Arizona U.S. February 12 2023Musk has given few clues to what type of leader he is looking for.On December 21 when he first announced he planned to step down as CEO he said only that he would limit his own duties to software and server engineering once someone foolish enough had taken his place.Since Musk took full ownership of Twitter on October 27 the platform has undergone a series of rapid changes with its CEO courting high praise and harsh criticism in equal measure. It has been a rollercoaster Musk told the Dubai conference.Last week thousands of Twitter users reported problems using the platform as the social network allowed paying users to post tweets as long as 4 000 characters.US tech media reported that Musk put out word to Twitter staff to put aside work on new features to focus on troubleshooting.Despite the difficulties the Twitter boss encouraged more communication. As a forum for communication it s great. And I would just encourage more communication... to sort of speak in an authentic voice. Sometimes people will have someone else be their sort of Twitter manager or something like that. People should just do their own tweets... I think that s the way to do it. Elon Musk talks virtually during the World Government Summit in Dubai United Arab Emirates Wednesday Feb. 15 2023A sign at Twitter headquarters is shown in San Francisco Dec. 8 2022Musk 51 made his wealth initially on the finance website PayPal then created the spacecraft company SpaceX and invested in the electric car company Tesla.He donated shares worth 1.95 billion in Tesla now the world s most valuable car maker to charity last year a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC showed on Tuesday.Musk donated about 11.6 million shares between August and December last year according to the filing which did not say which organization or organizations were the recipients.The Tesla CEO signed the Giving Pledge in 2012 a commitment by some billionaires to give at least half their wealth to philanthropy in their lifetime or upon their death.In 2001 he set up the Musk Foundation offering grants for the development of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity among other causes according to its website.In recent months however more attention has been focused on the chaos surrounding his 44 billion purchase of Twitter and the Ukrainian military s use of Musk s Starlink satellites for their communications.At today s conference in Dubai Musk offered a wide ranging 35 minute discussion that touched on his fears about artificial intelligence the collapse of civilization and the possibility of space aliens.But questions about Twitter kept coming back up as Musk described both Tesla and SpaceX as able to function without his direct day to day involvement. Twitter is still somewhat a startup in reverse he said. There s work required here to get Twitter to sort of a stable position and to really build the engine of software engineering. Musk also sought to portray his takeover of San Francisco based Twitter as a cultural correction. I think that the general idea is just to reflect the values of the people as opposed to imposing the values of essentially San Francisco and Berkeley which are so somewhat of a niche ideology as compared to the rest of the world he said. And you know Twitter was I think doing a little too much to impose a niche. Musk 51 made his wealth initially on the finance website PayPal then created the spacecraft company SpaceX and invested in the electric car company TeslaTesla CEO Elon Musk is pictured opening a new Tesla Gigafactory in Germany March 2022SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrives on the red carpet for the Axel Springer Awards ceremony in Berlin on December 1 2020Musk s takeover at Twitter has seen mass firings and other cost cutting measures as he tries to maximize profits at the company.However some of Musk s decisions have conflicted with the reasons that journalists governments and others rely on Twitter as an information sharing platform.Musk on Wednesday described the need for users to rely on Twitter for trusted information from verified accounts. However a confused rollout to a paid verified account system saw some impersonate famous companies leading to a further withdrawal of needed advertising cash to the site.But Musk also has become a thought leader for some as well albeit an oracle that is trying to get six hours of sleep a night despite the challenges at Twitter.Musk described his children as being programmed by Reddit and YouTube. He warned that artificial intelligence should be regulated very carefully describing it as akin to the promise of nuclear power but the danger of atomic bombs.He also cautioned against having a single civilization or too much cooperation on Earth saying it could collapse a society that s like a tiny candle in a vast darkness. And asked about the existence of aliens Musk had a firm response. The crazy thing is I ve seen no evidence of alien technology or alien life whatsoever. And I think I d know because of SpaceX he said. I don t think anybody knows more about space you know than me.

Rachel AbelaElon Musknever fails to give people something to talk about. More recently he pitched an offer to purchase the microblogging social media platform Twitter for 43 billion.The self proclaimed free speech absolutist wanted to purchase the website to promote independence and freedom of speech while hopefully removingcensorshipon legal need to be talked about topics like cannabis.Musk worth 259 billion according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index has presented his slight fondness for marijuana on several occasions. Whether he s being serious or playing around with followers in a cheeky whimsical way Musk has chosen to use the number 420 in oddly different ventures.According toThe Street we first saw the Tesla founder bring 420 to the masses when he tweeted a few years ago that he s considering taking Tesla private at 420. Photo courtesy of TeslaWhen he pitched his offer to purchase Twitter for 43 billion that would add up to 54.20 per share with emphasis on the last three digits. It s almost like with every purchase investment or news worthy announcement. The SpaceX founder looks to poke fun at the seriousness of each endeavor.He s done so by adding a nerdy meme a reference to 420 cannabis culture or simply just letting everyone know that he has a sense of humor.The Street points out that420 might be Elon s lucky number considering it s popped up in two pivotal transactions but he hasn t shared any reasons for why he chose this number even though some believe Musk might dabble in weed here and there.A few years ago the entrepreneurial enigma appeared on Joe Rogan s podcast The Joe Rogan Experience where he was given Rogan s blunt and encouraged to hit it considering its legal status in California.Photo courtesy of Joe Rogan Show YouTubeAperplexed Musk gazed at the smokey blunt and when Rogan asked Do people get upset if you do certain things like smoking marijuana Musk leaned in for a hefty draw.He didn t inhale the blunt but the scene brought another iconic meme to life that he s shared quite a bit since then.Suppose the Tesla and SpaceX founder goes through with purchasing the microblogging website Twitter. In that case we can only hope he ll remove barriers for cannabis companies to promote products and lifestyle choices without censorship.The cannabis industry has seen its fair share of censorship.

The older I get the harder it is to stay lean that s for sure the Tesla CEO said on a recentepisodeof The Joe Rogan Experience podcast.In the interview the 48 year old billionaire added that he likes eating tasty food and wishes he could do without exercise. Here s what else Musk said he does He lifts weights but doesn t love the treadmillMusk said he s been living in Boca Chica Village Texas while he works on SpaceX s next generation rocket Starship which is designed to go to Mars and the moon.Besides working I don t have much to do Musk told Rogan presumably before X A 12 his son with Claire Boucher aka Grimes was born on Monday . So he told Rogan he s had more time to exercise even though he s not a fan. To be totally frank I wouldn t exercise at all if I could Musk said. I prefer not to exercise. While Musk has a personal trainer he admitted that it s been a while since they worked out together. Instead he said he lifts some weights on his own.Many successful people likeMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadellaand evenWhite House advisor and immunologist Anthony Fauci swear by running for mental clarity and stress relief. But Musk said he doesn t love running. When Musk does go for a run on the treadmill he likes to watch TV. Maybe watch a show that you know if there s a compelling show that like pulls you in he said.In terms of Musk s other active interests he told Rogan who is a martial artist that he s dabbled in Taekwondo karate judo and Brazilian jiu jitsu.Musk added that he sent his kids to jiu jitsu from the age of 6. In addition to the new baby Musk has five sons with his first wife Justine Musk twins Griffin and Xavier 16 plus triplets Damian Saxon and Kai 14. Tasty food over healthy foodMusk s unconventional approach to food raised eyebrows in the past. If there was a way that I could not eat so I could work more I would not eat he said in the 2015 book Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future by Ashlee Vance.There was a period in his college years when he purposefullyonly spent 1 CAD on food a day eating foods like hot dogs peppers oranges and pasta.Nowadays he has a different view. Food s great Musk said on the podcast. I d rather eat tasty food and live a shorter life he said. Don t tell his mother Maye Musk who had along career as a registered dietitian. Musk however is still mindful of weight gain and its effects on other factors such as the strength of your immune system. Being overweight is a big deal he said.A tip for better sleepSome billionaires likeBill Gates and Jeff Bezos rely on seven or eight hours of sleep a night to stay productive and focused.Musk on the other hand sometimes works80 to 90 hours a week which doesn t leave much time for shut eye. In a 2018New York Times interview he said that it s often a choice of no sleep or Ambien referring to the sleep medication.Still Musk shared a useful bit of advice with regards to sleep quality. Eating before you go to bed is a real bad idea and actually negatively affects your sleep he said on the podcast. Indeed eating before bedcan cause heartburnbecause your food isn t able to properly digest. This sensation can also impact the quality of sleep you re able to get so you wake up more tired. Musk said that he avoids alcohol and food at least two to three hours before bed. Your quality of sleep will improve and your general health will improve a lot he said. It s a big deal.

Remote work is no longer allowed unless you have a specific exception. Managers will send the exception lists to me for review and approval Musk wrote.He added that the new policy first reported by Bloomberg would be effective from Thursday for a minimum of 40 hours a week.The news comes as the company continues to shed staff. Musk fired about half of the company s 7 500 strong workforce last Friday having bought it for 44bn 38.7bn the previous week and the chief information security officer Lea Kissner confirmed on Thursday she had left Twitter in the latest high profile departure.Musk said Twitter had been hit by a pause in spending from advertisers that had caused a massive drop in revenue . Twitter makes most of its more than 5bn in annual revenue from advertising.The company has begun rolling outTwitterBlue its new subscription service in the UK. Users who pay 6.99 a month get a blue tick next to their username as well as early access to forthcoming features such as bookmark folders and the ability to change the colour of the app icon. Musk is hoping that Twitter Blue will reduce the company s reliance on advertising.Despite the chief executive s promise last week that the international pricing of Blue would be adjusted proportionate to purchasing power parity an economic measure of exchange rates that takes into account the cost of living in various countries Musk seems to have given ground to Apple. The subscription service is billed through Apple s in app purchases which locked Twitter into charging 6.99 in the UK to match the 7.99 in the US.Musk tried to reassure advertisers about his plans for the company in a meeting on Twitter s audio chat feature Spaces on Wednesday.Big brands including General Motors United Airlines the cereal maker General Mills and othershave paused buying ads on Twitteras they watch whether Musk s past comments that he is a free speech absolutist will lead to a rise in hate speech and divisive content on the platform.Brands on Wednesday s call included Deutsche Bank Chevron Nissan Air Canada and Audi which has paused Twitter ads. The American outdoor equipment retailer REI also attended and said after the call that its ads were still paused according to Associated Press.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day we ll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningPrivacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

He said it would be advisory and not a command council .The mass layoffs have raised concern about the company s ability to maintain security on the platform and comply with government regulations. Those fears were compounded this week by the departure of three top security officials at the company includingKissner the chief privacy officer Damien Kieran and the chief compliance officer Marianne Fogarty.In their absence employees are being encouraged to self certify the platform is running in compliance with privacy laws according to a reportfrom the Verge on Thursday. Breaking these laws could result in billions of dollars in fines. This comes after Twitter reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in May over privacy issues under which it is required to perform privacy reviews before making changes to its products. The report suggested Musk had already bypassed its standard data governance processes relating to changes and an internal lawyer told workers to seek whistleblower protection if you feel uncomfortable about anything you re being asked to do according to the Verge.Kari Paul contributed reportingTopicsTwitterWorking from homeElon MuskTechnology sectornewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyMusk admits BBC among least biased in row over Twitter government funded media tag2d agoTwitter makes unexplained logo change to Dogecoin cryptocurrency image4 Apr 2023Row between Twitter and Substack ends with uneasy truce13h agoTwitter to no longer only promote paid for accounts after backlash29 Mar 2023Twitter to promote only paying users tweets Elon Musk announces28 Mar 2023Twitter takes legal action after source code leaked online27 Mar 2023Elon Musk memo suggests Twitter worth less than half of what he paid for it26 Mar 2023Rise in Twitter outages since Musk takeover hints at more systemic problems8 Mar 2023Twitter down for more than an hour around world1 Mar 2023Elon Musk fires additional 200 people at Twitter report says27 Feb 2023Most viewedMost viewedUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight to voteNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top 2023Guardian News Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In fact his unhealthy habits were bad enough to recently garner worry and criticism from his father Errol Musk.In an August 2022interview the 79 year old took a swipe at his son s physical appearance in recent photos that showed the SpaceX founder in an unflattering shirtless pose on a yacht in Mykonos. The Elder Musk coolly suggested his son take diet pills to cut weight.Shirtless Elon Musk vacations in Mykonos on luxury yachthttps t.co xH4luUMTgrpic.twitter.com j4N21y5wWT Page Six PageSix July 18 2022Lately Musk has been making space in his routine for some new healthy habits likeintermittent fasting and we re here for it.Here everything we know about how the wealthiest man in the world eats works out sleeps approaches mental health and his stance on prescription drugs.He Does Intermittent FastingJust weeks after those unfortunate photos surfaced the billionaire net worth 250.5 billion has the ultimate clap back losing 20 pounds.How Intermittent fasting.On advice of a good friend I ve been fasting periodically feel healthier Elon Musk elonmusk August 28 2022Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating.

Cutting the weight always comes at a cost even Kate Moss regrets saying nothing tastes as good as skinny feels. According toInsider Semaglutide is changing people s tastes and making them hate their favorite foods. Plus Ozempic faceisn t cute.Luckily Semaglutide is not the only diabetes drug with health benefits.Metforminis also used off label to treat obesity cancer and heart disease.

Researchers atBoston University School of Medicinefound that people who consume diet soda daily arethree times more likelyto suffer from a stroke or dementia within the next ten years. Plus aspartame the artificial sweetener found in most diet sodas has been linked to migraines irritable mood anxiety and insomnia 7 .Ironically researchers in China founda bit of coffee might actually do Musk some good.

If there was a way I could not eat so I could work more I would not eat says Musk in the 2015 bookTesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.There was a period in his college years where Musk survived on just 1 per day. My threshold for existing was pretty low he said on theStarTalkpodcast. You get really tired of hot dogs and oranges after a while. No kidding.Recently Musk s been eating more. Food s great he told Joe Rogan in 2020 onan episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. However his diet still has little to do with his health. I d rather eat tasty food and live a shorter life the 51 year old admits.One study suggests men of Musk s age still have a few years to turn things around. The study found that swapping a bad Western diet for a healthier one by age 60 can add up to eight years to your life 8 .Cleaning up your diet isn t rocket science.

Add on some of thebest foods for menlike lean protein whole grains colorful fruits and vegetables legumes and seeds and you have a recipe for success.Healthy eatingThe Best Foods Every Man Should EatThese Anti Aging Foods Can Add Years to Your LifeHe s Not VegetarianMusk used to be an herbivore but he switched up his eating habits circa 2013. I tried being a vegetarian but I don t really think we re designed to be vegetarians he toldThe Guardian. Some of my best friends are vegetarians even vegans which is tricky when you re trying to go out for dinner. Aside from struggles at the dinner table Musk shared with fans in 2019 that he still believes in the ethical treatment of animals but he s focused his climate change efforts elsewhere. A vegan vegetarian diet helps a little but isn t critical Musk says.I support people choosing whatever diet makes them happy but it s true that everyone going vegan still wouldn t stop climate change. Moving billions of tons of hydrocarbons from deep underground into the atmosphere oceans is fundamentally the issue. Elon Musk elonmusk December 30 2019Should you consider going meatless Eating a plant based diet has been shown to reduce saturated fats and boost fiber 9 .But it s not all good news. A 2019 study compared 137 plant based products with their meat counterparts and found that only four percent of those plant based alternatives were lower in sodium with sodium content ranging from 500mg per 100 grams up to a staggering 1 200mg 10 .Plus meat is one of the best sources of protein iron andvitamin B12 which can boost your energy and mood. By cutting meat out getting those nutrients isn t impossible but more challenging.Plant Based DietVitamin B12 Lifts Your Energy and Mood. Here s How to Get More of It.Kevin Hart Bets on Veganism With His New Plant Based Fast Food ChainHe s Trying to Workout More But Hates It To be totally frank I wouldn t exercise at all if I could he toldJoe Roganin 2020.When he does work out Musk likes to lift weights. He also shared with Rogan that he doesn t love running but when he musters up the energy to run on the treadmill he likes to watch TV.By exercising more regularly he could boost his lifespan and reduce his risk of chronic disease 11 . But Musk admits it s been increasingly difficult to stay in shape with age. The older I get the harder it is to stay lean that s for sure he told Rogan.More recently he s expressed more interest in getting in shape. I gotta workout out and be in better shape Musk told theFull Sendpodcast just one day after his father s condemning interview surfaced.He even shared how he plans to do it. I m going to switch from immediately looking at my phone first thing in the morning to working out for at least 20 minutes he says.If Musk does work out in the morning many studies suggest it may help him cut the weight more than afternoon workouts 12 especially if he works out before breakfast 13 . However the efforts of said plan remain to be seen.GET FITIf You re a Human You Need a Functional Fitness RoutineThe Best Time of Day to Exercise According to Your BodyHe Doesn t SleepElon Musk is tired. He has long waded deeply into the weeds of his companies. In 2018 he admitted his120 hour work weeksoften drove him tosleep on the Tesla factory floor. Musk revealed his schedule left him exhausted shocking nutty and like he d burnt out a bunch of neurons .In recent years Musk pared down his work schedule to a more sustainable 80 to 90 hours.But since recently taking ownership of Twitter in late October 2022 his workload is back to 120 hours per week.These days you can find him sleeping at Twitter headquarters in San Francisco where he s also provided beds for employees. I go to sleep wake up work go to sleep wake up work do that seven days a week says Musk. I ll do that for a while no choice but I think once Twitter is set on the right path it is a much easier thing to manage than SpaceX or Tesla. He usually gets about six hours of sleep going to bed at 3 a.m. and getting up around 9 or 9 30 a.m. well below the recommended eight hours.When he is in the mood for sleep Musk admitted he s fairly nocturnal anyways and turns to Ambien a common sleep medication for help. It s often a choice of no sleep or Ambien he confessed to theNew York Timesin 2018.Sleep requirements can vary among people experts recommend seven to nine hours of sleep for optimal health. Research suggests that after a good night s sleep you may feel less anxious and more confident 14 .One study found that men who slept less than five hours a night for one week had significantly lower levels of testosterone than when they had a full night s rest a 10 15 decrease in testosterone production on average 15 . Too little sleep has also been linked to depression 16 .SLEEP BETTERNot Getting Enough Sleep Could Have This Terrible Side EffectThese Science Backed Strategies Will Help You Fall Asleep FastHis Back HurtsNo thanks to his inane sleeping hours Musk struggles with back and neck pain. I m sorry for squirming around. I have quite severe back pain Musk recently told a lawyer during a trial in San Francisco.He traces his pain to a birthday party that was thrown years ago which was attended by a sumo wrestler. Musk who studied karate judo and Brazilian jiu jitsu in his youth took to the ring. He managed according to him to throw his 350 pound opponent resulting in an injury to his spine.Managed to throw him but it cost me smashing my c5 c6 disc 8 years of mega back pain Finally fixed with c5 c6 disc fusion. Elon Musk elonmusk March 21 2022The billionaire has also battled intense neck pain. In response to rumors circulating in 2020 about a new scar on his neck Musk confirmed he had two surgeries the first a failure to address his neck pain.Peep Musk s neck scar which can be seen in photos circa 2020 post surgery.He Has Asperger sWhether Musk s genius strikes you with intrigue or fear there s undeniable curiosity behind the inner workings of his brain.In recent years Musk has opened up. He first publicly disclosed in May 2021 that he has Asperger s syndrome when he appeared onSaturday Night Live.To the delight of fans in his May 2022TED Talk Musk gave more insight into how he learned to work with his Asperger s instead of against it.Growing up social cues were not intuitive so I was very bookish Musk recalls. Others could intuitively understand what was meant by something. I would take something very literally as if the words that were spoken were exactly what they meant. Despite communication struggles Musk s intense specialized interest in science and technology was amplified by his hyper focused mind a common trait among people with autism. My obsession with truth is why I studied physics he says because physics attempts to understand the truth of the universe. He Not Afraid of DeathIn an interview withAxel Springerin March 2022 Musk said he would like to maintain his health for a longer period of time but I am not afraid of dying he said. I think it would come as a relief. Health isn t the only concern Musk has about old age. I don t think we should try to have people live for a really long time he says. That would cause asphyxiation of society because the truth is most people don t change their minds. They just die. So if they don t die we will be stuck with old ideas and society wouldn t advance. LIVE LONGERThis Diabetes Drug Might Help Us All Live LongerScientists Are Working on Drugs that Kill Zombie Cells to Help You Live to 200He Hates Some Drugs and Loves Others Musk isn t a doctor and has zero medical credentials. Yet he s not shy about railing against Adderall amongst other medications in yet another infamous Twitter rant.Adderall is an anger amplifier. Avoid at all costs. Elon Musk elonmusk April 29 2022In other tweets he complainedWellbutrin is worse than Adderall shared afriend had bad experiences with Ritalin and suggestedpsychedelic drugs and ketamine as better treatmentsfor mental health struggles.All the drugs Musk warns against are prescription medications well established in medical practice. But psychedelics and ketamine are still in early stages of testing.According to theUS Food and Drug Administration Adderall treats ADHD and helps individuals who lack of attention to detail make careless mistakes or lack sustained attention. Ritalin is another common ADHD drug theFDA sayscan reduce impulsivity. Wellbutrin can help treat symptoms of depression.As far as Musk s drugs of choice there is some emerging science to back up his claims. One recent study examined the effects of microdosing the psychedelic psilocybin on 953 people. It found improvements in mood mental health and psychomotor ability physical movements related to cognitive processing 17 but more research is needed.According toHarvard two types of ketamine are used to treat depression. Ketamine infusion was approved as an anesthetic by the FDA years ago and is now used off label to treat depression.

I wish there was a way to get nutrients without sitting down for a meal. As the main staples Elon s diet consisted of hot dogs oranges pasta and green peppers. Because I have a great deal of respect for Elon and his ability to create I wanted to see if I could complete his challenge of living on one dollar a day.To be as accurate as possible I researched the inflation rate from when Elon was 17 years old until now.It turns out one dollar in 1989 would be the equivalent of about 2.20 today. I decided to round up to two dollars a day for this challenge to see if I could do it.My regular diet compared to Elon s dietMy usual routine consists of three meals a day. I usually have a breakfast bar and coffee in the morning.Lunch is made with either chicken or steak for protein complimented with grains and a mixed salad. Dinner also involves animal protein and a couple of vegetable sides.Needless to say mynormal dietis much more than 2 per day so I knew it would be a challenge to restrict my spending by that much. At two dollars per day I would need to feed myself for seven days for 14.00 or less.My breakfast for a weekI am perfectly content eating the same thing every day so I planned my week ahead of time.I bought 18 eggs for 2.00 and ate two each morning 0.29 per morning for seven days .I also purchased a five pound bag of brown rice for 3.38. I split this into seven servings 0.48 per serving and ate one serving for breakfast.The total cost of breakfast for the week 5.38My lunch for a weekFor lunch I made Rotini pasta. I purchased two boxes of Walmart brand Garden Rotini in the 16 ounce box for 1.00 each.I split the 32 ounces into seven servings for lunch 0.28 per day . I also purchased generic 24 ounce pasta sauce for 1.50 and split it over my lunch pasta 0.21 per day .For a side I purchased a three pound bag of mandarin oranges for 3.00 and split them evenly into 14 sides. I used them for lunch and dinner 0.21 per day .The total cost of lunch for the week 4.90My dinner for a weekI went with the eight pack of Bar S jumbo hot dogs for 1.16. I also purchased an eight pack of whole wheat hot dog buns for 0.87.I did cheat here because I did not have enough money for ketchup so I used some I already had in the refrigerator.I ate the mandarin oranges as a dinner side which equaled 0.21 each night.The total cost of dinner for the week 3.50My total cost of food for the week After adding it all up I spent a total of 13.87 on food for the week. I was able to do it for less than my goal of 14.00 but only by 0.13.How Elon Musk s diet made me feelBefore I started the Elon Musk challenge I drank one cup of coffee each day. When I started the diet I could not afford coffee so I was forced to drink only water for the week.This led to serious caffeine withdrawal headaches for the first three days. I was not expecting to have to deal with headaches which were more difficult than I envisioned.Lack of energyBefore going on Elon s diet I ate three large meals a day and was rarely hungry. However after a week on Elon Musk s diet I found I was drained and hungry most of the time.I assume it was mostly due to the large decrease in my caloric intake. My body was accustomed to eating 2 500 calories a day and the Elon Musk diet decreased my calories to around 1 000 1 500.Weight lossOne benefit of this diet was the fact I lost two pounds. Unfortunately it was not a healthy way to lose weight since it felt like I was starving myself.While I was able to complete his diet challenge I found that myhealth suffereddue to eating low quality food and not enough calories.Elon Musk s diet todayElon has come a long way since his diet challenge in 1989. His normal routine today consists of coffee in the morning and a small lunch he can eat in five minutes or less.His dinner choices usually involve one of his favorite dishes which include French cuisine or American barbeque.Elon no longer watches what he eats and onlyexercisesone to two times a week. For a man who is so busy it seems like food still gets in the way of his progress.More DietElon MuskExerciseHow ToMorning RoutineSuccessful HabitsLadders PressMore from LaddersI did 8 rounds of interviews and still didn t get the jobThis is what work will look like in 2030 and it isn t pretty I d give it a 10 out 10 2023Ladders Inc.ProductsJob SearchLadders RecruiterExpert NetworkHighest Paying JobsHighest Paying CompaniesHighest Paying CareersHighest Paying IndustriesCities StatesRemote JobsHelpCareer AdviceFAQSMember HelpRecruiter HelpContact UsUnsubscribeAbout LaddersCompanyEditorial TeamLadders EstimatesPress MediaPrivacyTerms of UseEditorial PolicyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationSite MapWork at Ladders
