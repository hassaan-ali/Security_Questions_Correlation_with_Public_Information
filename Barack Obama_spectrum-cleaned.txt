But biographer Janny Scott argues that those descriptions don't do justice to the president's mother — a complex, intellectual woman who led an "unconventional" life.NPRsubscribetoFresh AirpodcastNPR OneApple PodcastsSpotifyGoogle PodcastsAmazon MusicRSS linkAuthor InterviewsThe 'Singular Woman' Who Raised Barack ObamaFacebookFlipboardEmailMay 3, 201111:41 AM ETHeard onFresh AirThe 'Singular Woman' Who Raised Barack ObamaListen·34:1234:12Toggle more optionsDownloadEmbedEmbed<iframe src="https://www.npr.org/player/embed/135840068/135950317" width="100%" height="290" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" title="NPR embedded audio player">TranscriptA Singular Woman: The Untold Story of Barack Obama's MotherBy Janny ScottHardcover, 384 pagesRiverhead HardcoverList price: $26.95Read An ExcerptIn 1990, Barack Obama became the first African-American president of theHarvard Law Review.
A year later, he was approached by a literary agent, who asked if he would be interested in writing an autobiography about his life.Obama said yes, and in 1995, his bookDreams from My Fatherwas published.
As the title suggests, it focused mainly on the relationship he had with his father, Barack Obama Sr.
When articles about the book started coming out, they referred to his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, as simply "a white anthropologist from Kansas.
But the characterizations of Obama's mother — first as "a white anthropologist from Kansas" and then as "a single mother on food stamps" and "the woman who died of cancer while fighting with her insurance company at the end of her life" — don't encompass who she was, the unconventional life she led or the influence she had on the future president of the United States, says writer Janny Scott.Scott's biography of Obama's mother,A Singular Woman, traces Dunham's life and the relationship she had with her son, whose rise in the political world came largely after her death in 1995.
But he has said he largely thanks his mother for the values that led him to the work he now does.
He credits her with impressing upon him the importance upon one's duty to others — perhaps that the best thing that one can do is to give opportunities for others," Scott tellsFresh Air's Terry Gross.
And her work in many ways foreshadows his.
There was a period in 1979 where she was working in what her boss described to me as 'community development in Java.'
That's five years before he becomes a community development person in Chicago.

It was in Hawaii that she met a Kenyan student named Barack Obama.
Three months pregnant with their child, she married him in 1961.
Obama Sr. stayed in school in Hawaii, and Dunham returned to Seattle with her newborn baby, Barack.
She returned to Honolulu in 1963; she and Obama divorced in 1964.
In 1966, Dunham married Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian man studying in Honolulu on a student visa.Obama was largely raised in Hawaii for the first six years of his life, but in 1967, he moved to Indonesia with his mother to join Soetoro, who worked as a surveyor for the Indonesian government and then a consultant for Mobil.
Dunham taught English, worked in rural development and consulted on microfinance projects.
Obama attended local schools in Jakarta.
He also, at her insistence, took English correspondence classes and regularly woke up before dawn to go over his English language skills.
She believed that he deserved the kind of opportunities that she had had [like] the opportunity to a great university," Scott says.
And she believed that he would never get that if he didn't have a strong English-language education.
So at a certain point, she decided she wasn't serving his interests well by keeping him in Indonesia and in Indonesia schools.
Four years later, Obama moved back to Hawaii to live with his grandparents while his mother stayed in Indonesia with her second husband and daughter Maya Soetoro-Ng.
It was a complicated decision — and one that most people don't give her credit for, Scott says:"She was juggling a number of things: She wanted her son to get a good English-language education, which wasn't available to her in Indonesia.
She had an Indonesian daughter and an Indonesian husband at the time.
She needed to be able to work to pay for the education she wanted for her son and her daughter.
In order to work, she was going to need some kind of advanced degree.
So she was juggling a lot of things."
In 1972, Scott says, Dunham rejoined her son in Hawaii and stayed there during his middle school years.
She returned to Indonesia to do anthropological field work shortly after he entered high school.Enlarge this imageJanny Scott was a reporter forThe New York Timesfrom 1994 to 2008.Nina Subin/G.P.

PutnamObama decided not to return to Indonesia with his mother.
In 1985, she wrote a list of her long-range goals, which included "finish[ing] her dissertation, making a salary of 60K, los[ing] weight ... and having constructive dialogue with Barry" — a nickname used for the junior Barack Obama.Scott says she doesn't know of any problems between Obama and his mother, but there were some indications that his mother felt some sadness about the physical distance between them.
At different moments in her life she is upset, and at one point, in his senior year of high school in Hawaii, she goes back just to be with him because she realizes it's the last year of his childhood," she says.
Later, one friend describes her as wistful about his decision to move to Chicago and root himself in Chicago and emphasize the sort-of black part of himself.
So I think there was a theme — and this is just snippets of little things I've stumbled upon — that she had a kind of longing for a closer relationship with him.
Interview HighlightsOn her thoughts about articles written about Obama after he was elected president of theHarvard Law Review" 'His mother is a white woman from Kansas,' [or] 'His mother is an anthropologist,' or 'His mother is an anthropologist working in international development,' and that would be about it.
There were] long descriptions of his father's family history.
She went back to Indonesia during that period and confided to a friend how distraught and upset she was to be reduced to one sentence.
On interviewing President Obama for the book"I asked him about the [implication left] by his book that his mother was sort of a naive idealist — something that comes through in the way he talks and sometimes in the way other family members talk about her.
But that's not at all the description that I get from people who knew her as a colleague — close friends of hers.
No one has ever described her in that way to me.
Obama] said that he did think of her as a bit that way, but he didn't think of it as a pejorative.
He described those qualities as a source of her strength in many ways.
On the "birther" movement"The birther movement began during the campaign, when I was actually writing a series of biographical pieces forThe New York Timeson then-Senator Obama.
And then it kind of faded out a bit.
So during the period when I was doing the research, it wasn't something I was thinking a whole lot about ... and then was resuscitated by Donald Trump.
In the beginning, particularly because of speaking to so many people about President Obama's mother's life, and of course that covered his birth, I really had no question as to where he was born.
He was born in Hawaii.
When it became more and more pressing in recent months, I went back and looked at everything I had ever gathered on that subject.
... And it seemed so clear.
So I came to the conclusion that many people have come to — that this is a classic conspiracy theory, and it feeds on information that may well be to the contrary but is all taken to be evidence of the conspiracy.

 BARACK OBAMA, MARCH 18, 2008The photograph showed the son, but my eye gravitated toward the mother.
That first glimpse was surprising — the stout, pale-skinned woman in sturdy sandals, standing squarely a half­step ahead of the lithe, darker-skinned figure to her left.
His elas­tic-band body bespoke discipline, even asceticism.
Her form was well padded, territory ceded long ago to the pleasures of appetite and the forces of anatomical destiny.
He had the studied casualness of a catalog model, in khakis, at home in the viewfinder.
She met the camera head-on, dressed in hand-loomed textile dyed the color of indigo, a silver earring half hidden in the cascading curtain of her dark hair.
She carried her chin a few degrees higher than most.
His right hand rested on her shoulder, lightly.
The photograph, taken on a Manhattan rooftop in August 1987 and e-mailed to me twenty years later, was a revelation and a puzzle.
The man was Barack Obama at age twenty-six, the community organizer from Chicago on a visit to New York.
The woman was Stanley Ann Dunham, his mother.
It was impossible not to be struck forcefully by the similarities, and the dissimilarities, between them.
It was impossible not to question, in that moment, the stereotype to which she had been expediently reduced: the white woman from Kansas.The president's mother has served as any of a number of useful oversimplifications.
In the capsule version of Obama's life story, she is the white mother from Kansas coupled alliteratively with the black father from Kenya.
She is corn-fed, white-bread, whatever Kenya is not.
In Dreams from My Father, the memoir that helped power Obama's political ascent, she is the shy, small-town girl who falls head over heels for the brilliant, charismatic African who steals the show.
In the next chapter, she is the naive idealist, the innocent abroad.
In Obama's presidential campaign, she was the struggling single mother, the food stamp recipient, the victim of a health-care system gone awry, pleading with her insurance company for cover­age as her life slipped away.
And in the fevered imaginings of supermarket tabloids and the Internet, she is the atheist, the Marx­ist, the flower child, the mother who "abandoned" her son or duped the state of Hawaii into issuing a birth certificate for her Kenyan­born baby, on the off chance that he might want to be president someday.The earthy figure in the photograph did not fit any of those.
A few months after receiving the photo, I wrote an article for The New York Times about Dunham.
It was one in a series of bio­graphical articles on then Senator Obama that the Times published during the presidential campaign.
It was long for a newspaper but short for a life, yet people who read it were seized by her story and, some said, moved to tears.
As a result of the article, I was offered a chance to write a book on Dunham, and I spent two and a half years following her trail.
I drove across the Flint Hills of Kansas to the former oil boomtowns where her parents grew up during the Depression.
I spent many weeks in Hawaii, where she became pregnant at seventeen, married at eighteen, divorced and remar­ried at twenty-two.
I traveled twice to Indonesia, where she brought her son, at six, and from whence she sent him back, alone, at age ten, to her parents in Hawaii.
I visited dusty villages in Java where, as a young anthropologist, she did fieldwork for her Ph.D. disserta­tion on peasant blacksmithing.
I met with bankers in glass towers in Jakarta where, nearly two decades before Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank shared the Nobel Peace Prize for their work with microcredit, Dunham worked on the largest self-sustaining commercial microfinance program in the world.
I combed through tattered field notebooks, boxes of personal and professional papers, letters to friends, photo albums, the archives of the Ford Founda­tion in Midtown Manhattan, and the thousand-page thesis that took Dunham fifteen years to complete.
I interviewed nearly two hundred colleagues, friends, professors, employers, acquaintances, and relatives, including her two children.
Without their generosity, I could not have written this book.To describe Dunham as a white woman from Kansas is about as illuminating as describing her son as a politician who likes golf.
Intentionally or not, the label obscures an extraordinary story—of a girl with a boy's name who grew up in the years before the civil rights movement, the women's movement, the Vietnam War, and the Pill; who married an African at a time when nearly two dozen states still had laws against interracial marriage; who, at age twenty­-four, moved to Jakarta with her son in the waning days of an anti-communist bloodbath in which hundreds of thousands of Indonesians are believed to have been slaughtered; who lived more than half of her adult life in a place barely known to most Ameri­cans, in an ancient and complex culture, in a country with the larg­est Muslim population in the world; who spent years working in villages where an unmarried, Western woman was a rarity; who immersed herself in the study of a sacred craft long practiced ex­clusively by men; who, as a working and mostly single mother, brought up two biracial children; who adored her children and believed her son in particular had the potential to be great; who raised him to be, as he has put it jokingly, a combination of Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, and Harry Belafonte, then died at fifty-two, never knowing who or what he would become.
Had she lived, Dunham would have been sixty-six years old on January 20, 2009, when Barack Obama was sworn in as the forty­fourth president of the United States.FromA Singular Woman: The Untold Story of Barack Obama's MotherbyJanny Scott.

Photograph: Rex FeaturesBarack ObamaThis article is more than14 years oldObama to take the oath of office using his middle nameThis article is more than 14 years oldElana Schorin WashingtonWed 10 Dec 2008 11.36 ESTBarack Obama today confirmed that he will take the presidential oath of office using his middle name, Hussein, a choice depicted as routine but likely to be viewed as an olive branch by majority-Muslim nations.Obama's oath-taking plan comes after a campaign season that saw his full name used in a pejorative capacity by several allies of his rival, John McCain.
The president-elect described taking the oath with his full name as a run-of-the-mill decision not intended to be significant.
I think the tradition is that they use all three names" to swear in new presidents, Obama told the Los Angeles Times, "and I will follow the tradition, not trying to make a statement one way or the other.
I'll do what everybody else does.
Yet several recent American presidents, including Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, omitted their middle name when taking the oath.The past controversy roused by Republicans over his middle name lent a confident undertone to Obama's choice, as did his renewed vow to deliver a speech in a majority-Muslim nation.
Speculation has centred on Indonesia, where Obama spent four years of his childhood, as the likely site of his future visit.
How we structure that is something that I will determine with my national security team in the coming weeks and months," Obama told the Times.
But I think we've got a unique opportunity to reboot America's image around the world and also in the Muslim world in particular.
Obama also addressed some of the more prosaic details of his transition to the presidency in the interview.
He said he would keep his home in the Hyde Park neighbourhood of Chicago as a refuge during his term, calling it his "Kennebunkport", a riff on the elite Maine town where the Bush family vacations.The president-elect also addressed yesterday's shocking arrest of Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who faces charges of bribery for allegedly seeking to sell off Obama's Senate seat.Obama reiterated a statement he released yesterday, telling the LA Times that "I have not discussed the Senate seat with the governor at any time", but declined to address local reports that his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, helped blow the whistle on Blagojevich.Asked if he knew of any recent conversations between Emanuel and the disgraced governor, Obama replied: "Let me stop you there, because it's an ongoing investigation.
I think it would be inappropriate for me to remark on the situation beyond the facts that I know.

58]Economics careerObama first worked as a government economist for an oil company in Kenya.
59]In 1965, Obama published a paper entitled "Problems Facing Our Socialism" in theEast Africa Journal,harshly criticizing the blueprint for national planning, "African Socialismand Its Applicability to Planning in Kenya", developed byTom Mboya's Ministry of Economic Planning and Development.
Obama considered the document to be not adequately socialist and African.
60][61]Obama served as an economist in the Kenyan Ministry of Transport.
Later he was promoted to senior economist in the Kenyan Ministry of Finance.
62]In 1970, Obama was in a serious automobile accident, and was hospitalized for nearly a year.
In December 1971, he traveled to Hawaii for a month.
63]There he visited with his ex-wife Ann Dunham and American son Barack II, who was nearly 10.
The visit was the last time the boy saw his father.
37]During his trip, Obama took his son to his firstjazzconcert, a performance by the pianistDave Brubeck.
64]His son recalled Obama giving him his first basketball:I only remember my father for one month my whole life, when I was 10.
And it wasn't until much later in life that I realized, like, he gave me my first basketball and it was shortly thereafter that I became this basketball fanatic.
And he took me to my first jazz concert and it was sort of shortly thereafter that I became really interested in jazz and music.
So what it makes you realize how much of an impact [even if it's only a month] that they have on you.
But I think probably the most important thing was his absence I think contributed to me really wanting to be a good dad, you know?
Because I think not having him there made me say to myself, "You know what?
I want to make sure my girls feel like they've got somebody they can rely on.
65]Final years and deathGraveof Barack Obama Sr. in home ofSarah Onyango Obamain villageNyang'oma KogeloinSiaya County,Kenya, 19 August 2016According to Barack II's memoir, Obama's continuing conflict withKenyan presidentJomo Kenyattadestroyed his career.
66]He came under suspicion afterTom Mboyawas assassinated in 1969, as he had been a protege of the ruler.
Kenyatta fired Obama, who wasblacklistedin Kenya and found it impossible to get work.
By the time Obama visited his son in Hawaii in 1971, he had a bad leg from the 1970 accident.
67]Obama later lost both legs in a second serious automobile accident, and subsequently lost his job.
His life deteriorated as he struggled with poverty and drinking.
During his final decade, he never recovered his former social or economic standing.
His friend Philip Ochieng, a journalist of the Kenya newspaperDaily Nation,has described Obama's difficult personality and drinking problems.
In 1982, Obama had a relationship with Jael Otinyo and with her fathered his last son, namedGeorge Obama.
George was raised by his mother, who later remarried; his stepfather cared for him as well.
23]Six months after George's birth, Obama died in a car crash inNairobi.
He was interred in his native village ofNyang'oma Kogelo,Siaya District.
14][21]His funeral was attended by ministersRobert Ouko,Peter Oloo-Aringo, and other prominent political figures.

4][7][8]The Honolulu Advertiserand theHonolulu Star-Bulletinannounced the birth.
9]Soon after their son's birth, while Obama's father continued his education at the University of Hawaii, Ann Dunham took the infant toSeattle, Washington, where she took classes at theUniversity of Washingtonfrom September 1961 to June 1962.
She and her son lived in an apartment in theCapitol Hillneighborhood.

Obama was enrolled as "Barry Soetoro" (no.
1), and was wrongly recorded as an Indonesian citizen (no.
3) and a Muslim (no.
4).
21]In 1967, Obama and his mother moved toJakartato rejoin his stepfather.
The family initially lived in a newly built neighborhood in the Menteng Dalamadministrative villageof theTebetsubdistrictinSouth Jakartafor two and a half years, while Soetoro worked on a topographic survey for the Indonesian government.
22][23]From January 1968 to December 1969, Obama's mother taught English and served as an assistant director of the U.S. government-subsidized Indonesia-America Friendship Institute,[24]while Obama attended theIndonesian-languageSanto Fransiskus Asisi(St. Francis of Assisi)Catholic Schoolaround the corner from their house for 1st, 2nd, and part of 3rd grade.
22]Obama's mother met atransgenderperson named Evie (who was known as Trudi at the time), at a cocktail party in 1969.
Dunham was so impressed by Evie's beef steak and fried rice that she offered her a job in the family home.
It did not take long before Evie was also caretaker for  then eight-year-old "Barry", as Obama was often referred to as then, and his baby sister Maya.
As a caretaker, she also spent time playing with Obama and bringing him to and from school, which she continued to do for about two years.
25]In 1970, Soetoro took a new job at higher pay inUnion Oil Company's government relations office.
4][22][26][27][28][29]From January 1970 to August 1972, Obama's mother taught English and was a department head and a director of the Institute of Management Education and Development.
24]Obama attended the Indonesian-language government-runBesuki School, one-and-half miles east in the exclusiveMenteng administrative village, for part of 3rd grade and for 4th grade.

30]In the summer of 1970, Obama returned to Hawaii for an extended visit with his maternal grandparents,StanleyandMadelyn Dunham.
His mother had also arranged an interview for possible admission to thePunahou Schoolin Honolulu, one of the top private schools in the city.
31]On August 15, 1970, Dunham and Soetoro celebrated the birth of their daughter,Maya Kassandra Soetoro.
32]Return to Hawaii[edit]In mid-1971, Obama moved back to Hawaii to live with his grandparents and attendPunahou Schoolstarting in fifth grade.
33][34]In December 1971, Obama was visited for a month by his father, Barack Obama Sr., from Kenya.
It was the last time Obama would see his father.
This was followed by his mother visiting her son and parents in Honolulu from late 1971 to January 1972.In 1972, Dunham returned to Hawaii, bringing along the young Maya, Obama's half-sister.
Dunham started graduate study in anthropology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
From sixth grade through eighth grade at Punahou, Obama lived with his mother and Maya.
35][36]Obama's mother completed her coursework at the University of Hawaii for an M.A.
in anthropology in December 1974.
37]After three years in Hawaii, she and Maya returned to Jakarta in August 1975,[38]where Dunham completed her contract with the Institute of Management Education and Development and started anthropological fieldwork.
39]Obama chose to stay with his grandparents in Honolulu to continue his studies at Punahou School for his high school years.
8][40]In his memoir Obama describes his experiences growing up in his mother'smiddle classfamily.
His knowledge about his African father, who returned once for a brief visit in 1971, came mainly through family stories and photographs.
41]Of his early childhood, Obama writes: "That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind.
5]The book describes his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of hismultiracialheritage.
42]He wrote that he usedalcohol,marijuana, andcocaineduring his teenage years to "push questions of who I was out of my mind".
43]Obama was also a member of the "choom gang", a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.
44][45]Obama has said that it was a serious mistake.
At the Saddleback Civil Presidential Forum, Barack Obama identified his high-school drug use as his greatest moral failure.
46]Obama has stated he has not used any illegal drugs since he was a teenager.
47]Some of his fellow students attending Punahou School later told theHonolulu Star-Bulletinthat Obama was mature for his age as a high school student and that he sometimes attended parties and other events in order to associate withAfrican Americancollege students and military service people.
Reflecting later on his formative years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: "The opportunity that Hawaii offered—to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect—became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.

49]On February 18, 1981, he made his first public speech, calling for Occidental'sdivestmentfrom South Africa.
49]In the summer of 1981, Obama traveled to Jakarta to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of Occidental College friends inHyderabad (India)andKarachi (Pakistan)for three weeks.
49]He then transferred toColumbia UniversityinNew York City, where he majored inpolitical sciencewith a speciality ininternational relations[50][51]and inEnglish literature.
52]Obama lived off campus in a modest rented apartment at 142 West 109th Street.
53][54]He graduated with aB.A.from Columbia in 1983, then worked atBusiness International CorporationandNew York Public Interest Research Group.
55][56]Early career in Chicago[edit]After four years living in New York, Obama moved to Chicago to work as acommunity organizer.
He worked for three years from June 1985 to May 1988 as director of theDeveloping Communities Project(DCP), a church-based community organization originally comprising eightCatholicparishes in Greater Roseland (Roseland,West Pullman, andRiverdale) on Chicago's farSouth Side.
55][57][58]During his three years as the DCP's director, its staff grew from 1 to 13 and its annual budget grew from $70,000 to $400,000, with accomplishments including helping set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization inAltgeld Gardens.
59]Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for theGamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.
60]In the summer of 1988, he traveled for the first time to Europe for three weeks then to Kenya for five weeks where he met many ofhis paternal relativesfor the first time.
61]Law School[edit]Langdell Hall, home of theHarvard Law SchoollibraryObama enteredHarvard Law Schoolin late 1988.
In an interview withEbonyin 1990, he stated that he saw a degree in law as a vehicle to facilitate better community organization and activism: "The idea was not only to get people to learn how to hope and dream about different possibilities, but to know how the tax structure affects what kind of housing gets built where.
62]At the end of his first year he was selected as an editor of theHarvard Law Reviewbased on his grades and a writing competition.
63]In February 1990, his second year at Harvard, he was elected president of the law review, a full-time volunteer position functioning as editor-in-chief and supervising the law review's staff of 80 editors.
64]Obama's election as the first black president of the law review was widely reported and followed by several long, detailed profiles.
64]He got himself elected by convincing a crucial swing bloc of conservatives that he would protect their interests if they supported him.
Building up that trust was done with the same kind of long listening sessions he had used in the poor neighborhoods of South Side, Chicago.Richard Epstein, who later taught at the University of Chicago Law School when Obama later taught there, said Obama was elected editor "because people on the other side believed he would give them a fair shake.
58][65]While in law school he worked as an associate at the law firmSidley & Austinin 1989, where he met his future wife,Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, and whereNewton N. Minowwas a managing partner.
Minow later would introduce Obama to some of Chicago's top business leaders.
58]In the summer of 1990 he worked atHopkins & Sutter.
66]Also during his law school years, Obama spent eight days in Los Angeles taking a national training course on Alinsky methods of organizing.
58]He graduated with aJ.D.magna cum laudefrom Harvard in 1991 and returned to Chicago.
63]Settling down in Chicago[edit]The publicity from his election as the first African American president of theHarvard Law Reviewled to a contract and advance to write a book about race relations.
67]In an effort to recruit him to their faculty, theUniversity of Chicago Law Schoolprovided Obama with a fellowship and an office to work on his book.
67]He originally planned to finish the book in one year, but it took much longer as the book evolved into a personal memoir.
In order to work without interruptions, Obama and his wife, Michelle, traveled toBaliwhere he wrote for several months.
The manuscript was finally published asDreams from My Fatherin mid-1995.
67]He married Michelle in 1992[68]and settled down with her inHyde Park, a liberal, integrated, middle-class Chicago neighborhood with a history of electing reform-minded politicians independent of the Daley political machine.
69]The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998; their second, Natasha (known as Sasha), in 2001.
70]One effect of the marriage was to bring Obama closer to other politically influential Chicagoans.
One of Michelle's best friends wasJesse Jackson's daughter,Santita Jackson, later the godmother of the Obamas' first child.
Michelle herself had worked as an aide to MayorRichard M. Daley.
Marty Nesbitt, a young, successful black businessman (who played basketball with Michelle's brother,Craig Robinson), became Obama's best friend and introduced him to other African-American business people.
Before the marriage, according to Craig, Obama talked about his political ambitions, even saying that he might run for president someday.
58]Project Vote[edit]Obama directed IllinoisProject Votefrom April to October 1992, a voter registration drive, officially nonpartisan, that helpedCarol Moseley Braunbecome the first black woman ever elected to the Senate.
58]He headed up a staff of 10 and 700 volunteers that achieved its goal of 400,000 registered African Americans in the state, leadingCrain's Chicago Businessto name Obama to its 1993 list of "40 under Forty" powers to be.
71][72][73]Although fundraising was not required for the position when Obama was recruited for the job, he started an active campaign to raise money for the project.
According to Sandy Newman, who founded Project Vote, Obama "raised more money than any of our state directors had ever done.
He did a great job of enlisting a broad spectrum of organizations and people, including many who did not get along well with one another.
73]The fundraising brought Obama into contact with the wealthy, liberal elite of Chicago, some of whom became supporters in his future political career.
Through one of them he metDavid Axelrod, who later headed Obama's campaign for president.
58]The fundraising committee was chaired by John Schmidt, a former chief of staff to MayorRichard M. Daley, and John W. Rogers Jr., a young black money manager and founder of Ariel Capital Management.
73]Obama also met much of the city's black political leadership, although he didn't always get along with the older politicians, with friction sometimes developing over Obama's reluctance to spend money and his insistence on results.
58]"He really did it, and he let other people take all the credit", Schmidt later said.
The people standing up at the press conferences wereJesse JacksonandBobby Rushand I don't know who else.
Barack was off to the side and only the people who were close to it knew he had done all the work.
73]1992–1996[edit]Obama taughtconstitutional lawat theUniversity of Chicago Law Schoolfor twelve years, as a Lecturer for four years (1992–1996), and as a Senior Lecturer for eight years (1996–2004).
74]During this time he taught courses in due process and equal protection, voting rights, and racism and law.
He published no legal scholarship, and turned down tenured positions, but served eight years in the Illinois Senate during his twelve years at the university.
75]In 1993 Obama joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 12-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, thenof counselfrom 1996 to 2004, with his law license becoming inactive in 2007.
55][76]The firm was well known among influential Chicago liberals and leaders of the black community, and the firm's Judson H. Miner, who met with Obama to recruit him before Obama's 1991 graduation from law school, had been counsel to former Chicago MayorHarold Washington, although the law firm often clashed with the administration of MayorRichard M. Daley.
The 29-year-old law student made it clear in his initial interview with Miner that he was more interested in joining the firm to learn about Chicago politics than to practice law.
69]During the four years Obama worked as a full-time lawyer at the firm, he was involved in 30 cases and accrued 3,723 billable hours.
77]Obama was listed as counsel on four cases before theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
Two of these cases involvedACORNsuing GovernorJim Edgarunder the newMotor Voter Act,[78][79]one involved a voter suing Mayor Daley under theVoting Rights Act,[80]and one involved, in the only case Obama orally argued, awhistleblowingstockbroker suing his former employer.
81]All of these appeals were resolved in favor of Obama's clients, with all the opinions authored by Obama's University of Chicago colleague Chief JudgeRichard Posner.
82]Obama was a founding member of the board of directors ofPublic Alliesin 1992, resigning before his wife, Michelle, became the founding executive director of Public Allies Chicago in early 1993.
55][83]He served on the board of directors of theWoods Fund of Chicago, which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund Obama's DCP, from 1993 to 2002, and served on the board of directors of TheJoyce Foundationfrom 1994 to 2002.
55]Membership on the Joyce and Wood foundation boards, which gave out tens of millions of dollars to various local organizations while Obama was a member, helped Obama get to know and be known by influential liberal groups and cultivate a network of community activists that later supported his political career.
69]Obama served on the board of directors of theChicago Annenberg Challengefrom 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.
55]He also served on the board of directors of theChicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, theCenter for Neighborhood Technology, and the Lugenia Burns Hope Center.
55]In 1995, Obama also announced hiscandidacy for a seat in the Illinois state Senateand attendedLouis Farrakhan'sMillion Man MarchinWashington, DC.

PresidentsBarack ObamaBarack Obama: Life Before the PresidencyByConsulting Editor: Michael NelsonPhoto: University of ChicagoBarack Hussein Obama II was born on August 4, 1961, in Hawaii.
His parents, who met as students at the University of Hawaii, were Ann Dunham, a white American from Kansas, and Barack Obama Sr., a black Kenyan studying in the United States.
Obama's father left the family when Obama was two and, after further studies at Harvard University, returned to Kenya, where he died in an automobile accident nineteen years later.
After his parents divorced, Obama's mother married another foreign student at the University of Hawaii, Lolo Soetoro of Indonesia.
From age six through ten, Obama lived with his mother and stepfather in Indonesia, where he attended Catholic and Muslim schools.
I was raised as an Indonesian child and a Hawaiian child and as a black child and as a white child,” Obama later recalled.
And so what I benefited from is a multiplicity of cultures that all fed me.”Concerned for his education, Obama’s mother sent him back to Hawaii to live with her parents, Stanley and Madelyn Dunham, and to attend Hawaii’s prestigious Punahou School from fifth grade through graduation from high school.
While Obama was in school, his mother divorced Soetoro, returned to Hawaii to study cultural anthropology at the university, and then went back to Indonesia to do field research.
Living with his grandparents, Obama was a good but not outstanding student at Punahou.
He played varsity basketball and, as he later admitted, “dabbled in drugs and alcohol,” including marijuana and cocaine.
As for religion, Obama later wrote, because his parents and grandparents were nonbelievers, “I was not raised in a religious household.”Obama's mother, who “to the end of her life [in 1995] would proudly proclaim herself an unreconstructed liberal,” deeply admired the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and taught her son, he later wrote, that “To be black was to be the beneficiary of a great inheritance, a special destiny, glorious burdens that only we were strong enough to bear.” But, as culturally diverse as Hawaii was, its African American population was miniscule.
With no father or other family members to serve as role models (his relationship with his white grandfather was difficult), Obama later reflected, “I was trying to raise myself to be a black man in America, and beyond the given of my appearance, no one around me seemed to know exactly what that meant.”Obama left Hawaii for college, enrolling first at Occidental College in Los Angeles for his freshman and sophomore years, and then at Columbia University in New York City.
He read deeply and widely about political and international affairs, graduating from Columbia with a political science major in 1983.
A movie version of his Columbia years,Barry, was released in 2016.)
After spending an additional year in New York as a researcher with Business International Group, a global business consulting firm, Obama accepted an offer to work as a community organizer in Chicago's largely poor and black South Side.
As biographer David Mendell notes in his 2007 book,Obama: From Promise to Power, the job gave Obama “his first deep immersion into the African American community he had longed to both understand and belong to.”Obama's main assignment as an organizer was to launch the church-funded Developing Communities Project and, in particular, to organize residents of Altgeld Gardens to pressure Chicago's city hall to improve conditions in the poorly maintained public housing project.
His efforts met with some success, but he concluded that, faced with a complex city bureaucracy, “I just can't get things done here without a law degree.”In 1988, Obama enrolled at Harvard Law School, where he excelled as a student, graduating magna cum laude and winning election as president of the prestigious Harvard Law Review for the academic year 1990-1991.
Although Obama was a liberal, he won the election by persuading the journal’s outnumbered conservative staffers that he would treat their views fairly, which he is widely acknowledged to have done.
As the first African American president in the long history of the law review, Obama drew widespread media attention and a contract from Random House to write a book about race relations.
The book,Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance(1995), turned out to be mostly a personal memoir, focusing in particular on his struggle to come to terms with his identity as a black man raised by whites in the absence of his African father.During a summer internship at Chicago’s Sidley and Austin law firm after his first year at Harvard, Obama met Michelle Robinson, a South Side native and Princeton University and Harvard Law School graduate who supervised his work at the firm.
He wooed her ardently (as memorialized in another 2016 movie,Southside with You), and after a four-year courtship they married in 1992.
The Obamas settled in Chicago's racially integrated, middle-class Hyde Park neighborhood, where their first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998 and their second daughter, Natasha (called Sasha), was born in 2001.After directing Illinois Project Vote, a voter registration drive aimed at increasing black turnout in the 1992 election, Obama accepted positions as an attorney with the civil rights law firm of Miner, Barnhill and Galland and as a lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School.
He launched his first campaign for political office in 1996 after his district’s state senator, Alice Palmer, decided to run for Congress.
With Palmer’s support, Obama announced his candidacy to replace her in the Illinois legislature.
When Palmer's congressional campaign faltered, she decided to run for reelection instead.
But Obama refused to withdraw from the race, successfully challenged the validity of Palmer’s voter petitions, and was easily elected after her name was kept off the ballot.Obama’s time in the legislature initially was frustrating.
Republicans controlled the state senate, and many of his black Democratic colleagues resented the hardball tactics he had employed against Palmer.
But he adapted, developing cordial personal relations with legislators of both parties and cultivating Senate Democratic leader Emil Jones Jr., another African American senator from Chicago, as a mentor.
Obama was able to get campaign finance reform and crime legislation enacted even when his party was in the minority, and after 2002, when the Democrats won control of the Senate, he became a leading legislator on a wide range of issues, passing nearly 300 bills aimed at helping children, old people, labor unions, and the poor.Obama’s one serious misstep during his early political career (he later called it “an ill-considered race” in which he got “spanked” by the voters) was a 2000 Democratic primary challenge to US Representative Bobby Rush.
Rush was a former Illinois Black Panther leader who subsequently entered mainstream politics as a Chicago alderman and was elected to Congress from the South Side’s first congressional district in 1992.
Obama was not nearly as well known as the popular Rush, and the combination of his unusual upbringing and his association with predominantly white elite universities such as Columbia, Harvard, and Chicago aroused doubts about his authenticity as a black man among the district’s overwhelmingly African American voters.
Obama suffered what he labeled “a drubbing,” losing to Rush by a 30-percentage point margin.
Rush remained in the House; he was reelected to his thirteenth consecutive term in 2016.Returning to the state senate, Obama began eyeing a 2004 race for the US Senate seat held by Peter Fitzgerald, an unpopular first-term Republican who decided not to run for reelection.
In October 2002, as Congress was considering a resolution authorizing President George W. Bush to launch a war to depose the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, Obama spoke at an antiwar rally in Chicago.
I don't oppose all wars,” he declared.
What I am opposed to is a dumb war.
What I am opposed to is a rash war.” By speaking out against Bush’s war policies, Obama set himself apart from the other leading candidates for the Democratic Senate nomination, as well as from most Senate Democrats with presidential ambitions, including Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, John Kerry of Massachusetts, and John Edwards of North Carolina.
Obama’s initially unpopular antiwar stance eventually worked to his political advantage as the war became increasingly unpopular with the passage of time.Advised by political consultant David Axelrod, who had a strong record of helping black candidates succeed in majority-white constituencies, Obama assembled a coalition of African Americans and white liberals to win the Democratic Senate primary with 53 percent of the vote, more than all five of his opponents combined.
He then moved toward the political center to wage his general election campaign against Republican nominee Jack Ryan, an attractive candidate who, after making hundreds of millions of dollars as an investor, had left the business world to teach in an inner-city Chicago school.
But Ryan was forced to drop out of the race when scandalous details about his divorce were made public, and Obama coasted to an easy victory against Ryan’s replacement on the ballot, black conservative Republican Alan Keyes.
Obama won by the largest margin in the history of Senate elections in Illinois, 70 percent to 27 percent.In addition to his election, the other highlight of 2004 for Obama was his wildly successful keynote address at the Democratic National Convention.
There’s not a liberal America and a conservative America,” he declared.
There’s a United States of America.
There’s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America.
There’s a United States of America.” Obama encapsulated his speech’s themes of optimism and unity with the phrase, “the audacity of hope,” which he borrowed from Reverend Jeremiah Wright.
Wright was the pastor of Chicago’s Trinity United Church of Christ, a large and influential black congregation where Obama was baptized when he became a Christian in 1988.
Obama also used the phrase as the title of his second book,The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream(2006), which became a national bestseller in the wake of his newfound national popularity.
Describing his religious conversion, Obama wrote, “I felt God’s spirit beckoning me.
I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth.”Consulting Editor: Michael NelsonProfessor of Political ScienceRhodes CollegeBarack Obama's educationPunahou School, HawaiiOccidental College, Los AngelesColumbia University, New York CityHarvard Law School, BostonMore ResourcesBarack Obama Presidency PageBarack Obama EssaysLife in BriefLife Before the Presidency (Current Essay)Campaigns & ElectionsDomestic AffairsForeign AffairsFamily LifeImpact and LegacyUniversity of VirginiaMiller CenterMain navigationThe PresidencyIssues & PolicyExpertsEventsDonateUVA Democracy BiennialFooterAboutContact UsMiller Center Governing CouncilMiller Center FoundationPrivacy PolicyNotice of Non-Discrimination and Equal OpportunityDownload millercenter.org DataHelp inform the discussionSupport the Miller CenterFacebookTwitterYouTubeSubscribe© Copyright 2023.

This bipartisan measure
reauthorizes the 50-year-old Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), the nation’s national education law and longstanding commitment to equal opportunity for all
students.The new law builds on key areas of progress in recent years, made possible by the efforts of educators, communities, parents, and students across the country.For example, today, high school graduation rates are at all-time highs.
Dropout rates are at historic lows.
And more students are going to college than ever before.
These achievements provide a firm foundation for further work to expand educational opportunity and improve student outcomes under ESSA.The previous version of the law, the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, was enacted in 2002.
NCLB represented a significant step forward for our nation’s children in
many respects, particularly as it shined a light on where students were making progress and where they needed additional support, regardless of race, income, zip code,
disability, home language, or background.
The law was scheduled for revision in 2007, and, over time, NCLB’s prescriptive requirements became increasingly unworkable
for schools and educators.
Recognizing this fact, in 2010, the Obama administration joined a call from educators and families to create a better law that focused on the
clear goal of fully preparing all students for success in college and careers.Congress has now responded to that call.The Every Student Succeeds Act reflects many of the priorities of this administration.ESSA HighlightsPresident Obama signs the Every Student Succeeds Act into law on December 10, 2015.ESSA includes provisions that will help to ensure success for students and schools.
Below are just a few.
The law:Advances equity by upholding critical protections for America's disadvantaged and high-need students.Requires—for the first time—that all students in America be taught to high academic standards that will prepare them to succeed in college and careers.Ensures that vital information is provided to educators, families, students, and communities through annual statewide assessments that measure students'
progress toward those high standards.Helps to support and grow local innovations—including evidence-based and place-based interventions developed by local leaders and educators—consistent with
ourInvesting in InnovationandPromise NeighborhoodsSustains and expands this administration's historic investments in increasing access to high-qualitypreschool.Maintains an expectation that there will be accountability and action to effect positive change in our lowest-performing schools, where groups of students
are not making progress, and where graduation rates are low over extended periods of time.History of ESEAThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was signed into law in 1965 by President Lyndon Baines Johnson, who believed that "full educational opportunity"
should be "our first national goal."
From its inception, ESEA was a civil rights law.ESEA offered new grants to districts serving low-income students, federal grants for textbooks and library books, funding for special education centers, and
scholarships for low-income college students.
Additionally, the law provided federal grants to state educational agencies to improve the quality of elementary and
secondary education.NCLB and AccountabilityNCLB put in place measures that exposed achievement gaps among traditionally underserved students and their peers and spurred an important national dialogue on
education improvement.
This focus on accountability has been critical in ensuring a quality education for all children, yet also revealed challenges in the effective
implementation of this goal.Parents, educators, and elected officials across the country recognized that a strong, updated law was necessary to expand opportunity to all students; support
schools, teachers, and principals; and to strengthen our education system and economy.In 2012, the Obama administration began granting flexibility to states regarding specific requirements of NCLB in exchange for rigorous and comprehensive state-
developed plans designed to close achievement gaps, increase equity, improve the quality of instruction, and increase outcomes for all students.What's Next?Over the next few weeks, the U.S. Department of Education will work with states and districts to begin implementing the new law.

The point was to make this a surprise visit for the children.Students were excited when they caught a glimpse of the president.
It was surprising to see the president in my school," said Toi Lyles.
It was a nice experience to see Barack Obama," said Cameron Watson.Cameron also said he forgot what the president had talked about.But what the Obama administration doesn't want forgotten is early childhood education.It's on the president's agenda and a specialty of this school.
Extremely large elementary population, along with an early childhood population.
So I think they wanted to take a look at a program that's been in existence.
We have the first Judy center in Baltimore City Schools," said Assistant Principal William Allen.It wasn't until school was over that parents learned of the president's visit.
It was really shocking.
Happy at the same time," said parent Tiny Allen.But word quickly spread along the motorcade route.
We watched the cars come in and Barack waved to us, so I got some pretty good pictures," said Brenda.
I have camera footage of him coming in in the line and pictures.
Yep, definitely a memory for me.
I was born and raised, I went to the elementary school, so it's monumental" said parent Andreia Green.Certainly not your usual day at school.The president also left a souvenir: his drawing of a tiger for the class.Related Link: President Obama Arrives In Baltimore To Talk Jobs & OpportunityIn:Barack ObamaFirst published on May 17, 2013 / 4:30 PM© 2013 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

LeeJanuary 30, 2008 9:33 amJanuary 30, 2008 9:33 amThe exterior of 339 East 94th Street on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where Barack Obama is believed to have lived during and after college.
Photos: Ruth Fremson/The New York Times)The six-story walk-up at 339 East 94th Street has seen much over the decades: generations of mostly white and Hispanic immigrants, nests of mice, drug deals, a police bust, at least one stabbing, a recent influx of
                                        young professionals, and a future presidential candidate:Barack Obama.In his memoir,“Dreams From My Father”(Three Rivers Press, 1995), Mr. Obama described his Yorkville apartment,on East 94th Street between First and Second Avenues, as “part of the shifting border between East Harlem and the rest of Manhattan.” He described a scene that will sound
                                        familiar to undergraduates and others who scraped by in the seedy and dangerous New York of the 1980s:It was an uninviting block, treeless and barren, lined with soot-colored walk-ups that cast heavy shadows for the rest of the day.
The apartment was small, with slanting floors and irregular heat and a buzzer downstairs that didn’t work, so that
                                            visitors had to call ahead from a pay phone at the corner gas station, where a black Doberman the size of a wolf paced through the night in vigilant patrol, its jaws clamped around an empty beer bottle.He said that he would chat with Puerto Rican neighbors and stop to talk to the boys on the stoop about the Knicks or the gunshots heard the night before.
An old neighbor died on the third floor landing with $1,000 in
                                        small bills rolled up in his refrigerator.
Mr. Obama was living in the building when he received a phone call about his father’s death from a car accident in 1982.While no residents, current or past, who were contacted by The Times remembered Mr. Obama, they shared tales of a building with low rents and dicey circumstances during the early 1980s, when Mr. Obama apparently lived
                                        there, before and after he graduated from Columbia University in 1983.
B.
Obama” was listed in telephone directories at 339 East 94th Street in the early 1980s.
Mr. Obama did not specify the building
                                        number in his memoir, and his campaign has said that he has forgotten specifics of his youth.
Frank Neubauer, 73, who has lived all his life in the building except for two years in Brooklyn, confirmed Mr. Obama’s account that it was a rough place back then.
They had a lot of drug users in the
                                        building, everybody knew it,” he said.
Three generations of his family have lived in the building, including his son, who now lives on the same floor.)
Nobody paid any attention.
People knew it was
                                        going on and that was it, and eventually the cops came and cleaned up the building.”Violent crime was also rampant.
I had a gun put to my head in the lobby,” said David W. Burns, who lived in the building for two years in the early 1980s.
It was pretty late, 3 a.m. in the morning,
                                        I passed this guy on the street, but for some reason I forgot about him,” he said.
He just followed me into the vestibule.
Between two doors you’re pretty vulnerable.” The man took only
                                        his money.
Thank God.”Another resident was stabbed in the hall one evening by people who followed him home from the supermarket.
It was just in his thigh,” Mr. Burns recalled.
He was lucky.”The landlord in the early 1980s was Jay Weiss, a real estate mogul who was then the husband of the actress Kathleen Turner.
Mr. Burns, who now works in the media industry and lives in Wilton, Conn., said Mr. Weiss left
                                        behind hard feelings, because the building often had no heat and the front door was often unlocked.
Mr. Burns went after Mr. Weiss for overcharging for rent-stabilized apartments, eventuallywinning a judgment.“I actually used that money to pay for business school,” Mr. Burns said.When Mr. Neubauer was a child before World War II, the building was occupied by predominantly Austrian immigrant families with some Hungarians and German thrown in.
Back then everybody knew everybody in the
                                        building,” he said.As those families moved out, the inexpensive but relatively spacious apartments enticed working-class immigrant families, students and young professionals who needed cheap apartments in New York City.
Mr. Burns and
                                        his wife, both struggling artists, paid $450 for a two-bedroom apartment.)
The building was a solution, he said, for “when you are just getting out of college and you have no money, and you want to live in
                                        Manhattan.”Now: The ground-floor hallway at 339 East 94th Street.These days, the upper reaches of Yorkville have changed — in ways that might have been unthinkable to New Yorkers of earlier eras.
Luxury high rises have sprouted up.
The 94th Street building has become home
                                        to a more professional crowd.“When someone moves out or passes away, they renovate the apartment and charge market rates, so now you have a predominantly yuppie crowd,” Mr. Neubauer said.
That probably explains why few of them were home during the day when City Room went knocking door to door, though they did leave many barking dogs behind — one apartment had a dog-sitter.)Mr.
Neubauer says he is a political independent, so he cannot vote for his former neighbor on Tuesday.
I have to find out who is going to win the primary.
Then I will concentrate more on who I am going to vote
                                        for,” he said.As for Mr. Obama?
I like him.
I think he’s very intelligent.
He’s different.
He’s fresh.
Maybe that is what we need.”Among those who live in one of the renovated apartments, with their hardwood floors and white wooden cupboards, was Jasmine Correa, 28, who moved into the neighborhood three years ago, in part because of the high quality
                                        of the neighborhood’s public schools.She was surprised, she said, by how much the landlord, Faith Ministries, had raised the rent in the last year for a ground-floor studio, to just around $1,500 a month from around $1,100.“This building was really bad back then,” Ms. Correa had heard.
It’s amazing that a leader used to live here in this building.”But her political sympathies lie elsewhere: She said her preferred candidate isRon Paul.Jodi Kantor contributed reporting.

Oh yes, there is plenty of gunplay in this city.
Two young men were shot
                                            in the head within a block of where I live (Wash.Hgts) in one week.
But this idea that one hears gunshots on a regular basis in Spanish Harlem or the South Bronx or similar neighborhoods is bunk.
Students who
                                            include the “gunshots heard at night” in their essays about their neighborhoods are told to stick to the facts.
But they all usually try it at least once, thinking it has some sort of impact.

                                            doesn’t.Ron S.January 30, 2008·11:09 amSen.

I bet they’re tax-exempt.
I also bet they use this place for yuppies, further displacing the poor.We need Obama.
It matters not where he lived.
Go Patriots!
41-7)bill cigichJanuary 30, 2008·11:27 amE 94th seems really inconvenient for a Columbia student (m96 to the 1/9, I guess).AMIGOJanuary 30, 2008·11:29 amA humble upbringing and undergoing trials early on in life, like Barack Obama experienced, is the basis of his insight, good judgment and widom.People like GW, HRC etc will never know or understand what it
                                            is to live the common man’s life and hence their incapacity to comprehend and govern properly.That is why we desperately need Barack Obama to lead us in these turbulent times!James W.January 30, 2008·11:38 amMax G., you are criticizing Ms. Lee’s paraphrase of the various things Obama talked about with neighborhood boys on the stoop.
In any event, I find it hard to believe that “[a]ny NYC writing teacher”
                                            would flunk someone who was editor-in-chief of the Harvard Law Review.JanJanuary 30, 2008·11:45 amHaving lived in NYC during those year, I too, do not recall gunshots every night.
The only people who seemed to hear them were family and other xenophobes who believe the exaggerated media of the “big, bad
                                            city”.
As for Obama having the lock on humble upbringings, I suggest Amigo check the facts on HRC.
She was not a child of wealth and fought to enter a college when female undergrads were not allowed there.Go Giants!MazzJanuary 30, 2008·11:47 amGunshots?
I have lived in the East New York section of Brooklyn and can attest that we go to sleep not counting sheep but gunshots.StevenJanuary 30, 2008·11:47 amJasmine Correa, 28, should request a rent history from the DHCR to make sure her apartment wasn’t unlawfully deregulated.
NYC DemocratJanuary 30, 2008·11:54 am“Dreams of my father” is a fascinating and beautifully written book written long before Obama had presidential aspirations (1995).
Its a rare and refreshingly candid glimpse into the psyche of a modern
                                            political figure (he was offered the chance to tell his story after becoming the first african american president of law review at harvard law).
My decision to vote for Obama was made before i read the book,
                                            but after doing so I was certain I would be voting for him.
His credentials are exceptional, but his range of personal experiences is unparalleled among the field of Democratic candidates.Mary AndersonJanuary 30, 2008·11:58 amHOW ARE GUNSHOTS TRITE!
Perhaps the greatest impact they show now is the fact that so many inner-city residence find them to be trite.
Out side of those neighborhoods, where the average American lives, they are
                                            not normal.
This is not something people should have to live with!Over all, Obama offers the world the first REAL president.
Someone who knows what it is like to be poor.
I don’t care what he wrote
                                            about in an essay, what I care about is that he DID hear gunshots every night and that he DID live in a poorer neighborhood.
No more silver spoon politicians.
Obama is REAL.EugenioJanuary 30, 2008·11:59 amNYC is the womb of many a newcomer into society at large.
If you are to be “born”, you must endure the smallness of city living apartments, coupled with its greedily expensive rent.
Then, it’s
                                            on to suburbia, where we dump our past and move on to greener pastures.
Sigh!RTHJanuary 30, 2008·12:00 pmRon S:You have an excellent memory, sir.
I’m 24 and can’t remember the number of the house I lived in two years ago.
I’ve moved twice since then – as college students do – and they all
                                            tend to blur together.
I’m glad you’ve got such a memory, I’m sure it’s useful, but I hardly think it’s outside the realm of possibility that Mr. Obama has forgotten the numbers
                                            of the building he lived in 25 years ago.TOMJanuary 30, 2008·12:01 pmMore nonsence.
Where is the substance?
I lived in many shady places before I made it too.
Does that mean I should be President?Vote TOM in ’08!!Mrs.
Clinton is a hard working policy wonk that knows how to get it done and compromise.
Does anyone remember compromise?
Things actually got done when moderates were valued over the far right and left politicians.New York BredJanuary 30, 2008·12:03 pmAs a New Yorker who has lived in the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn I can say that if you live in a poor neighborhood like I have that you will certainly hear gunshots OFTEN…I don’t find it
                                            trite but true.
Great to see that he has really seen America vs. the privilage with which much of the pipeline of future presidents will have experienced.On another note do we really need another Clinton in the Whitehouse to ensure that we get another 4-8 more years of the 28 year old Bush-Clinton dynasty??
cbdJanuary 30, 2008·12:03 pmGunshots?
Sketchy neighborhood?
Oh, really?
Living in the high rise across the street from that building, I must have had my head in the clouds – in the 20 years I lived in that neighborhood (and seeing it
                                            go from working class to yuppieville) I never was accosted or any way made to feel threatened, for the most part, the neighbors were working people who just called 94th street home, the most newsworthy theft
                                            was the constant stealing of the placque commemorating the birth site of Lou Gehrig, well, it was the one the neighborhood commented on – maybe I need to read Obama’s book and learn where I was
                                            really living!
Sounds too much like “it was a dark and stormy night” to me!alexJanuary 30, 2008·12:04 pmhis campaign says he “has forgotten specifics of his youth”well, that sounds a bit odd.
who forgets where they lived when they were in college?but it seems part and parcel of hie selective memory and his attempt to whitewash himself in order to become a cipher that everyone can pour their own desires into – erase your past so you become an empty

You may actually change your mind.
Senator Obama has changed some of his childhood
                                            recollections in the newer book and his friends that he mentions in the book challange much of what he said about his childhood in Hawaii where he attended one of the best private schools in the nation.
Obama’s
                                            comment like his comments on everything else he gets caught on like his 130 “present” votes in the Illinois State Senate is oh you don’t understand or I don’t remember.You may also want to read more about the Rezko interactions with the Obamas which he now says were “boneheaded” but they were clearly not that.
They were smart and in essence netted the Obamas a deal
                                            on their home and then the lot next door for about $600,000 less than he would have had to pay for them if he bought them on his own at the time.The seller wouldn’t sell one without the other.
That isn’t boneheaded but a smart real estate deal with someone who was already under investigation which Obama knew because it was headlined in teh
                                            Chicago Tribune,wanted something from Obama.Obama has spent a career of running for office and to his credit except for his first try, winning.
But the races were easy and he has yet to be challenged.
The free ride the press is giving him will stop if the
                                            Republicans get the chance to go after him.
Unfortunately he won’t be prepared.He is a nice charismatic guy and an amazing speaker.
But the reality is, that is it.
He has no real record and there is no way we will know what he will or can do as President.Again read the 2nd book and look at the discrepencies, they may make you see him more as the hungry politician he is rather than the saint some in the media are trying to make him out to be.What's NextLoading...Previous PostA Former Mayor’s Failed Endgame in FloridaNext PostAt a Staten Island Pub, Young Republicans Weigh the ChoicesLooking for New York Today?New York TodayNew York Today is still going strong!

Portantino (D - La Cañada Flintridge) proudly announced today that Caltrans has installed the President Barack H. Obama Highway Signs renaming a portion of the CA-134 Freeway after our 44th President.
The renaming was a result of the passage of SCR 8 authored by Portantino and Congressman Jimmy Gomez.
SCR 8 called for the stretch of the CA - 134 freeway between the Glendale CA-2 and the Interstate 210 Freeway to be named the “President Barack H. Obama Highway”.
Earlier in the year, community members from across Southern California attended a reception hosted by Portantino, Bob and Faye Davidson and Occidental College to generously donate the money to Caltrans for the creation and installation of the signs.“This is an exciting day for Southern California and it showcases our deep respect and appreciation for President Obama.
The President has often mentioned his fond memories of living in Pasadena and attending Occidental College, so it was very appropriate to name the portion of the freeway he travelled after him.
Our community came together to make this happen.
It is an honor to be in a position to have helped facilitate this wonderful symbol of our collective respect for the grace and dignity embodied by our 44th President,” commented Portantino.President Obama attended Occidental College from 1979 to 1981 and lived in Pasadena during his sophomore year.
His attendance at Occidental College influenced his political trajectory and lead him to become one of the most revered and respected Presidents in history.
Local democratic activists John Gallogly suggested the idea to name the freeway to Portantino who then took the idea to Sacramento.
SCR 8 passed the legislature with bi-partisan support.
When news of the freeway naming hit the media, Portantino was inundated with offers from across the country to pay for the sign however he chose to keep it local.
Community members were invited to participate and take “ownership” of the project.
Local responses were overwhelming, and the sign was quickly paid for.“So many generous people can share in the accomplishment of this appropriate recognition of an inspiring, positive leader.
I am very grateful to Caltrans for its rapid response to our community’s generosity by installing the signs before Christmas.
What a great way to bring in 2019.
I hope to have a formal unveiling and program in the New Year to properly commemorate the President and our new freeway,” concluded Portantino.CommitteesOffice InformationCapitol Office1021 O Street, Suite 7630Sacramento, CA 95814Phone:(916) 651-4025Fax:(916) 651-4925Glendale District Office601 East Glenoaks Suite 210Glendale, CA.

And when he shoves something in there, people pay attention.Based on a review of more than 12,400 reports filed by the White House press pool since he took office six years ago, TIME.com took it upon themselves todissectnearly every one of the President’s public dining choices, including dozens of burger joints, a slew of steakhouses and more than 15 date night destinations withMichelle Obama.Needless to say, this list is making us hungry.9 Photos That Prove Vice President Joe Biden Loves Himself Some Ice CreamIt’s no secret that our Commander-in-Chief’s go-to-meal is a good old fashioned burger.
His locations of choice include everywhere from the ever-growing Shake Shack to Washington, D.C.’s Good Stuff Eatery to Matt’s Bar in Minneapolis (knownfor stuffing gooey, molten cheese in the middle of their patties).But Mr. Obama isn’t alone in his foodie habits — when the First Couple goes out to eat, they do it right.
Their date night dinners have included N.Y.C.’s pricy, farm-to-table Blue Hill, Honolulu’s Asian fusion hot spot Nobu Waikiki location and 12 Bones Smokehouse in Asheville, NC for some delectable barbecue.
Let the reservation envy sink in.Apparently steaks are also a fit meal for the leader of the free world.
He’s dined at Washington, D.C.’s BLT Steak, Bourbon Steak as well asBillandGiuliana Rancic’s RPM Steak in Chicago — where he chowed down on everything from a Grand Seafood Platter (oysters, shrimp, Alaskan king crab and lobster), a dry-aged bone-in Kansas City cut steak and the restaurant’s signature chocolate cake.RELATED: 10 Photos that Prove the President Loves Burgers as Much as We DoWhile the First Lady is his favorite dinner date, the TIME.com interactive gives a breakdown of all of the others frequenting his table, including one pastor, two mayors, and four governors.So what’s Obama’s favorite restaurant?

The president and his family were adventurous eaters who enjoyed visiting restaurants at the high-end, the low-end, and everything in between.
They favored small businesses and places with touchstones to the past, as well as establishments that pointed toward the future of dining.
And despite the gaggle of Secret Service people and reporters who followed the First Family on every one of their eating excursions, the president and his clan often managed to make connections with restaurant staff members and fellow diners.
Here are 13 ofour favorite President Obama dining moments, listed in chronological order:Date Night at Blue Hill[Daniel Krieger]Four months after taking office,President Obama took First Lady Michelle toDan Barber’s farm-to-table gemBlue Hillin the heart of NYC’s Greenwich Village neighborhood.
As would prove to be the case with most Obama date night dinners, this meal was not announced to the public ahead of time, and a circus formed outside the blocked-off streets near the restaurant.
Eater tipsters immediately reported that Secret Service members were crawling all over the tops of the brownstones along Washington Place.
After their meal, the Obamas headed to Broadway for the opening night ofJoe Turner’s Come and Gone.
As far as pre-theater dinner choices go, the intimate and effortlessly inventive Blue Hill is an A+ pick.Barack and Bill and Pasta on Monday[Bill Clinton and Barack Obama leaving Il Mulino][Getty/JIM WATSON]A few months after the Blue Hill dinner,another large chunk of Greenwich Village was blocked off during the middle of the dayso that Barack Obama could have lunch with his presidential foodie predecessor,Bill Clinton, at clubby, well-regarded Italian restaurantIl Mulino.After their meal was complete, Clinton told the press: "We had fish, pasta, and salad.
Even I was healthy."
No matter how you slice it, having lunch at Il Mulino — a classic New York City Italian restaurant — on a Monday afternoon is a total power move.NOLA Pitstop[Senator Obama with Leah Chase during a previous visit in 2008]Getty/EMMANUEL DUNANDOn October 14, 2009, President Obamawas in New Orleans for a mere four hours, but he somehow managed to squeeze in a visit to the Crescent City’s famedDooky Chase’srestaurant, whereLeah Chaseserved up fried chicken, shrimp Creole, and gumbo in portions that were “enough to share.” Obama had previously visited the restaurant while campaigning in 2008 (pictured above), and he also hosted Chase at the White House during his early days in office.Cheeseburger Diplomacy[Getty/MANDEL NGAN]Instead of takingDmitry Medvedevto one of Washington’s deal-making restaurants or trendy canteens, in June 2010Obama chose to buy the Russian president an all-American lunch atRay’s Hell Burgerin Arlington, Virginia.
Medvedev got a patty loaded with jalapeños, mushrooms, and onions, while Barack stuck to a classic cheeseburger.
They split an order of fries.
A photo of their modest meal landedabove the fold on the front page of theNew York Timesthe next day.Barack and Michelle Hit MiniBar[On Valentine’s Day 2013, Michelle and Barack Obamaspent a few hours insideJosé Andrés'sforward-thinking D.C. restaurantMiniBar, where only 24 guests are seated per night at a tasting counter facing an open kitchen.
At this hot-ticket restaurant, the chefs turn out around 20 courses of modern Spanish cuisine, including items like beef tendon churros and snow-cone cocktails.
Andrés was a big supporter of Michelle’s Let’s Move campaign, andBarack gave him a National Humanities Medalin 2015.The Government Shutdown Hoagie RunGettyIn early October 2014, while Washington was in the throes of a government shutdown,President Obama and V.P.
Joe Biden made a run to Philly-style sandwich shopTaylor Gourmetwhich, at the time, was offering special discounts (and free cookies) to furloughed employees.
Barry and Joe picked up two sandwiches for themselves, as well as some extras for the members of Congress.
Two years prior to this visit, President Obamamet with the proprietors of Taylor Gourmet to discuss issuesfacing small business owners.Obama and Abe Visit JiroPresident Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe outside Sukiyabashi Jiro in TokyoAFP/Getty ImagesFive years into his tenure as president, Barack Obama gained access to what might very well be the world’s most impenetrable restaurant:Sukiyabashi Jiro, the Tokyo train-station counter that was the subject of the hit filmJiro Dreams of Sushi.In April 2014,the POTUS andJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abeenjoyed a 90-minute meal prepared by sainted sushi masterJiro Ono.
Upon leaving the dining room, Obama remarked: “That's some good sushi right there.
Barry and Joe Hop Behind the Counter at Shake ShackPresident Obama hit up a lot of burger joints during his two terms as president including the D.C. areaShake Shacks.Duringone particularly memorable visitto Danny Meyer’s burger restaurant in May 2014, President Obama decided to jump behind the counter to take a photo with the staff, and Vice President Joe Biden followed suit.
This spontaneous move was captured in one of the all-time greatest photos of the POTUS:President Obama slides across the counter to pose for a photo w employees at Shake Shack in DC.
The VP did the same.pic.twitter.com/J5YktRCP3p— petesouza (@PeteSouza44)May 16, 2014AsTimescritic Pete Wells noted on Twitter, the timing of this visit was perfect, because earlier in the week, an MLB manager and playerclaimed to get food poisoning fromthe Citi Field Shake Shack.Wells quipped: “Advice for restaurants: If somebody claims they got food poisoning at your place, simply get POTUS & VP to eat there before the week ends.”Obama Cuts the Line at FranklinJust baracking around guys #America #atx #presidentialA photo posted by Jordan Lee (@joleetx) onJul 10, 2014 at 11:46am PDTGetting to fly around in Air Force One is pretty cool and everything, but the greatest perk of being the President of the United States isskipping the world’s most notorious food line.
President Obama did exactly that in July 2014 when he rolled up to Austin smoked meat meccaFranklin Barbecueand picked up $300 worth of lunch to-go.PitmasterAaron Franklintold Eater Austin: “No one's ever just skipped line and gone right up to the counter and ordered food, but if it's okay for someone to do it, it's him.
Everyone was super duper excited and he bought people's lunches.
It didn't seem to piss anybody off.”The Obamas Arrive at Estela[The dining room at Estela][Daniel Krieger]Duringthe week of the U.N.
Assembly in October 2014, Barack and Michelle Obama closed down traffic on Houston Street in Manhattan by attending dinner at impossibly hip (and thoroughly wonderful) restaurant/wine barEstela.
Here’s where the Obamas showed that they had their finger on the pulse — this is the restaurant that all the gastronomes and New York scenesters were clamoring to get into at the time.
In restaurant nerd terminology, scoring a dinner reservation at Estela in fall 2014 is akin to saying that you saw Bruce and the E-Street Band at some little Asbury Park dive back in 1971.The Ultimate Daddy-Daughter Date Night[Daniel Krieger]Carboneis an Italian-American restaurant not too far away from Estela that offers a distinctly cinematic experience — the waiters wear red tuxedos, Rat Pack tunes echo through its cavernous dining rooms, and the Caesar salads are mixed tableside.
It’s a little silly, but also super fun and the food is terrific.
All things considered, Carbone was an excellent choice for President Obama’s dinner date with his daughters Sasha and Malia in July 2015.The Obamas and their crew ordered the veal parm, the crab cakes, the porterhouse for two, the spicy rigatoni alla vodka, the meatballs, and the lobster ravioli, plus a bottle of Fenocchio Barbaresco 2010 for the adults.All the Cinnamon Rolls, Please[Getty/MANDEL NGAN]Like most people, Barack Obama likes to treat himself to snacks when he travels.
A generous soul, the POTUS also likes to surprise his staff and the reporters who follow his every move with travel treats.During a visit to Anchorage, Alaska in September, 2015, the leader of the free world stopped into local brunch spotSnow City Cafeand purchased the restaurant’s entire supply of cinnamon rolls, as well as a few sampler boxes of other goodies from the pastry case, for the presidential caravan.America’s Coolest Dads Meet in VietnamDuring his last year in the White House, President Obama made a trip to Hanoi, Vietnam,where he met up with the food world’s biggest superstar,Anthony Bourdain, for a humble meal of pork noodle soup, washed down with a few brews.
The lunch cost around $6, and Bourdain offered to pick up the tab.
During their meal together, Obama told Bourdain a little bit about what it’s like to eat out as POTUS:I don’t get to sneak out period, but once in awhile I’ll take Michelle out on a date night.
The problem is, part of enjoying a restaurant is sitting with other patrons and enjoying the atmosphere and too often we end up getting shut into one of those private rooms in the back.Although he probably won’t be able to cut the line at Franklin any more, now Barack should have an easier time hitting up restaurants with his family and enjoying the atmosphere.•All Coverage of Barack Obama[E]Can't get enough of Eater?Sign up for our newsletter.Watch: How Obama’s White House Chef Does Turnip CurryMore FromEaterSign up for theSign up for Eater's newsletterThe freshest news from the food world every dayThanks for signing up!Check your inbox for a welcome email.Email(required)Oops.

Or at least like a former local who went on to have exclusive access to the nuclear codes while simultaneouslyovercoming raging Dad-jeans syndromewithout missing a beat?
Let Barack Obama's favorite dining picks guide your taste buds through some of the best eats Chicago has to offer.1.Valois Restaurant#Valois #presidentstable #chicagoA post shared by Annmarie Fertoli (@annmariefertoli) onJun 13, 2017 at 9:24am PDTApparentlycommunity organizers love solid diner food—even after they become the leaders of the free world.
Obama is no exception to that (completely scientific, we swear) rule, dining at the comfort-food-slingingValoiscafeteria from his early days in Chicago to hisfinal days of the presidency.
And the former First Eater clearly likes starting his day with a gastronomic bang, as evidenced by hisalleged Valois breakfast go-tos.2.TopolobampoRare Mexican art collection by @rick_bayless; impressive photo by @emilia_czader; stunning restaurant design by @ariagrouparchitectsA post shared by Topolobampo (@topolochicago) onJun 20, 2017 at 8:26am PDTYou know how sometimes you crave delicious Mexican food so hard thatyou make a reservation under a fake nameand then show up with your enormous Secret Service entourage?
Obama so gets that.
It’s not a huge surprise that his love for the innovative takes on old-school Mexican dishes at Rick Bayless’Topolobampohas inspired some rather unexpected maneuvers.How to Eat Your Way Through D.C. Like Obama: A Guide to His Favorite Restaurants in the City3.MacArthur’sA post shared by Mayra Jackson (@mayraj_chi_art_boutique)onJan 12, 2015 at 4:05pm PSTBack when he was a mere senator with a gleam in his eye, Barry ruminated on his love for soul-food jointMacArthur’sinThe Audacity of Hope.
The legendary spot dishes up timeless classics like meatloaf, collard greens, chicken wings, and mac and cheese—but 44 is especially fond of their turkey legs and dressing.4.R.J.
GruntsFew things in life should be taken more seriously than burgers.
A post shared by R.J. Grunts (@rjgrunts) onMay 18, 2017 at 12:04pm PDTLettuce share a random fact: The salad bar concept was born in 1970 atR.J.
Grunts(and you are very welcome for the pun).
So it makes sense that the garden-loving Obamas would gravitate to the casual, family-friendly Windy City staple.
Of course, it’s not all unlimited baby corn and cherry tomatoes—they also serve up plenty of juicy burgers to appeal to theex-Cheeseburger-Fiend-in-Chief.5.SpiaggiaIt could be the killer views of Lake Michigan and theMagnificent Mile, or possibly the authentic Italian cuisine and massive wine list, or maybe it’s the nostalgia for the very first eatery they hit up for date night after winning the 2008 presidential election… Something keeps pulling Barack and Michelle back toSpiaggiafor special occasions.
Of course, it could just be the call ofthe diver scallop dish that the ex-prez has dubbed a cannot-miss.6.Manny’s Coffee Shop & DeliKeeping the world in balance (more or less) earns you a big-ass sandwich every now and then, right?
Right?
The former Oval Office occupant’s regular order (now known as the Presidential Special) atManny’s Coffee Shop & Deliis no less than an overstuffed corned beef sandwich, a potato pancake, and a lovely wedge of cherry pie.
respect7.Italian Fiesta PizzeriaNobody freak out, but in the mecca of deep dish, the former First Foodie’s favorite pizza is actually the thin crust and heavy toppings churned out byItalian Fiesta Pizzeria.
Just don’t go blabbing about it to any other Chicagoans.)
Michelle turned him on to the spot after going there with her family regularly as a reward for good grades when she was growing up.
In fact, the Obamas’ love for the pies runs so deep that the owners were flown out to D.C. to cook up pizzas for the inauguration.

But Chicago's two most famous residents have their own list of favorite restaurants.
Next time you're there, take a page from their book and check out one or more of these places to eat in the City of the Big Shoulders.
You'll find upscale dining and casual restaurants among the Obamas' go-tos when they're in Chicago.01of 06SpiaggiaView MapThis upscale restaurant, which presides at the head of theMagnificent Mile, was the Obamas' restaurant pick the Saturday night after Barack Obama won his bid to become president of the United States.
So it must be pretty special.
It's not a surprise, though, that they chose it; this elegant mainstay has hosted many couples' celebrations over the years.
Its James Beard Award-winning chef serves up modern Italian food the includes handmade pasta and small plates.
It's also consistently listed as one of America's 100 Best Wine Restaurants byWine Enthusiast.
But you can't just drop in spontaneously for dinner; reservations are required.02of 06TopolobampoView MapAddress445 N Clark St,Chicago,IL60654,USAGet directionsPhone+1 312-661-1434WebVisit websiteThe Obamas understandably name Rick Bayless' upscale, Mexican-inspired Topolobampo on North Clark Street as one of their Chicago faves.
This gourmet Mexican restaurant offers two five-course tasting menu options, classic and seasonal, along with a seven-course tasting menu.
They probably also appreciate Bayless' Frontera Grill, which is located right next door.
It's the more relaxed version and just as delicious.03of 06MacArthur'sView MapAddress5412 W Madison St,Chicago,IL60644,USAGet directionsPhone+1 773-261-2316WebVisit websiteThis popular soul food mecca on the city's far west side got a mention in Barack Obama's book "Audacity of Hope" as one of his favorite restaurants in the city.
Word is he loves their turkey legs and dressing.
It's Southern food heaven, where you can get grits, baked or fried chicken, catfish, and short ribs.04of 06R.J.

It opened in 1970 and launched not only the salad bar concept but also Lettuce Entertain You, a privately held, wildly successful Chicago restaurant group.R.J.
Grunts' casual atmosphere still exudes the '70s feel, and it's a great place to bring kids, but it works best for children who no longer have a need for high chairs and strollers.
The dining room is a bit cramped, so it doesn't accommodate either particularly well.
This is too bad because it's within an easy walking distance of theLincoln Park Zoo.
No doubt Malia and Sasha give R.J. Grunts a thumbs up, too.It serves up a huge choice of burgers, shakes, malts, onion rings, french fries, nachos, wraps, and a salad bar with 50 items... you get the picture.Continue to 5 of 6 below.05of 06SepiaView MapAddress123 N Jefferson St,Chicago,IL60661,USAGet directionsPhone+1 312-441-1920WebVisit websiteThe restaurant draws its name from the print shop that was housed there almost a century ago.

However, it is important to remember that Obama was a key supporter of reforming climate policies and reducing carbon pollution through increasing car's fuel efficiency, making it understandable that he drives mostly modern, efficient carsrather than vintage gas-guzzling muscle cars.Let's go on to look at the cars that feature in ex-President Barack Obama's driving history.2008 Ford Escape HybridVia: CarWallsObama's 2008 Ford Escape Hybrid is by no means the typical car of any famous person, be it celebrity or politician.While a hybrid SUV seems like an irrationally mundane choice for a car, Obama's political persona as an avid activist for the reduction of carbon emissions actually supports such a choice, as an insanely inefficient car would be directly hypocritically to his political ideology.Now while Obama helped finance various green movements and organizations, luckily for us, his Escape did not adopt the green exterior depicted above.
Instead, his dark gray Escape houses a more bulky front end, spacious seating capacity, and an impressive fuel economy, 34 MPG City and 30 MPG Highway.
Furthermore, the car has a variety of comfort features such as cruise control, keyless entry, and adjustable steering wheel.
The downside of impressive efficiency is poor performance, which is due to the increased weight of the hybrid power terrain and the minimal power potential, 133 HP, of the hybrid 4-cylinder engine.
That being said the '08Escape creates class-leading efficiency and it still remains that way today.Ex-President Obama proves his politics, promoting efficiency in his ownership of the 2008 Ford Escape Hybrid.RELATED:2020 Ford Escape Hybrid Plug-in Reaches 100 MPGe Milestone2005 Chrysler 300CVia: Auto EvolutionObama also briefly owned a 2005 Chrysler 300C.
That's right, the one with the proper HEMI V8.Before you yell "HYPOCRITE" and vent your anger on Facebook, it is important to mention that Obama owned this car while he was a senator, and before his major involvement in environmental politics.
But we are not here to discuss politics, so let's look at the '05 300c.
In contrast to the Escape, the 300c hosts a huge 5.7-liter HEMI V8 that produces 340 HP, putting it in an entirely different category.
The power is sent to the rear wheels through a 5-speed automatic transmission, producing a 0-60 MPH time of 5.3 seconds.The 300's muscular front end and bulky exterior harks back to the muscle cars of the '60s and '70s but utilizes modern technology to create a variety of luxury comfort options that are rare in classic muscle cars.
From digital climate control to a Multi-Displacement System that promotes fuel economy by shutting off four cylinders, the 300c juxtaposes Mopar with modern, giving an aggressive driving experience that does not skimp on comfort.While Obama's ownership of the 300c only lasted during the time that he was a governor, car enthusiasts can all agree that it makes a pretty awesome addition to the list,even if it is not worth the $1 Million eBay asking price that someone attempted to sell it for.2000 Jeep Grand CherokeeVia: YouTubeKeeping in line with the Ex-President's affinity for SUVs, the 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee is certainly a more capable off-road vehicle than his hybrid Escape.While it might not be the most reliable year for the Grand Cherokee, it is not only a great first new car but definitely impressive in its own right.
Besides the soft leather upholstery and dual-zone climate control, the performance of the Grand Cherokee is a key selling point.
Performance is promoted through its nimble size and powerful engine choices: a 4.0-liter inline-six producing 195 HP and a 4.7-liter V8 producing 235 HP, making it equally apt for suburban sight-seeing and munching through mud.
Grip is maximized through its dedicated 4WD system (MotorTrend), which senses and controls torque transfer.The 2000 Grand Cherokee supports ex-president Obama's modesty, demonstrating a wide variety of impressive cars that can be attained by everyday people.Current CarVia: Liberty CityAs with any Ex-President of the US, Obama is not allowed to drive himself anywhere in his own private car, a fundamental privilege most citizens enjoy.This is understandably so, as Obama is still a significant figure in American society, especially politics, even if he is no longer the president.
Hence, the Secret Service chauffeurs him everywhere he goes, fully accompanying him on his journey, to ensure that his safety and security are upheld even in his Ex-President status.
While there are minimal specifics available online, Grunge states that the "[ex-presidents] can never drive a car on an open road again," and are instead driven around by specially trained members of the Secret Service.Again, specifics of Secret Service vehicles are not divulged online, however, an article by The Drive confirms that heavily modified Chevrolet Suburbans are part of the Secret Service vehicle 'collection'.Far from factory standard, these sturdy SUVs feature additional armor plating and defensive systems to protect their passengers.While there is no explicit confirmation that the Secret Service actively chauffers Obama around in a Chevy Suburban, chances are the Ex-President has ridden in one at least once in his post-presidency life.Sources: HotCars.com, Cars.USNews.com, MotorTrend.com, CarAndDriver.com, AutoExpress.co.uk, GearPatrol.com, FoxNews.com, Grunge.com.

By then, President Obama was running for a seat in the U.S. senate — so Murphy photocopied the title, hoping the vehicle might be worth something someday.
Indeed, it was: Even though she daily drove it as if it were any other Grand Cherokee, she auctioned it off in 2010, after President Obama’s ascent to the highest elected office in the U.S., and received just under $26,500 for it — or roughly eight times its normal value.
The buyer, John Reznikoff, was an expert on historical documents and memorabilia.So how does President Obama remember his Grand Cherokee?
In 2012, he toured the Jefferson North Assembly Plant in Detroit that built the vehicle — a tour he followed up with a speech near the assembly line.
The first new car I ever bought was a Grand Cherokee,”he said to thunderous applause, while starting his speech.
Up until that point, I had some old beat-upused cars.”President Obama went on to say that he remembers “walking into that showroom and driving out with that new car… it had that new car smell, and everything worked.” President Obama also smiled as he told gathered factory workers that he has “some good memories of that car.”After the Grand Cherokee, President Obama moved on to anotherChryslerproduct: aV8-powered 300C sedan, which failed to sell on eBay in 2012with a $1-million starting bid.

Car formerly owned by Barack Obama listed on eBay for $1 million | The World from PRXGlobal PoliticsCar formerly owned by Barack Obama listed on eBay for $1 millionThe TakeawayJanuary 30, 2012 · 11:43 AM ESTThis Chrysler 300C, formerly owned by President Barack Obama is listed for sale on eBay Motors for $1 million.
Photo courtesy of eBay motors.
President Barack Obama's car is for sale.No, we're not talking about the armored limousine he cruises around Washington, D.C., in.
Even if the budget is tight, the U.S. government hasn't stooped that low.
In fact, the car in question isn't even a recent model.This car is a 2005 Chrysler 300C that Obama used to drive around when he was back in Chicago while still just the junior U.S. senator from Illinois.
And the current owner is trying to sell it on eBay.The asking price?
1,000,000.Ryan Porter, who writes for Celebrity Cars Blog, said the history the car has with Obama is nice, but it doesn't make it worth $1 million.
According to Kelly Blue Book, a 300C with all of the options, in excellent condition with low-mileage, would be worth little more than $15,000.
When it comes to the Blue Book, it should add nothing.
In a great world, maybe double the price," Porter said.But the car was popular, and not just with politicians in the mid 2000s.
It's not a Bentley, but for the time when he owned it, this was a really popular car," Porter said.
The funny thing is, this car was made very popular in music videos.
It was a hot car for athletes to have.
It's a good-looking car.
But people did compare it to Bentleys.
The car was listed on eBay shortly after Obama's inauguration and was bid up to $100 million by fake bidders, Porter said.
This has happened too many times," Porter said.
Things go on eBay, and next thing you know fake bids are coming in left and right.
While bids can go up, there's no reason to think they'd legitimately reach $1 million, let alone $100 million, Porter said.There are no bids on the car at this time.Sign up for our daily newsletterSign up for The Top of the World, delivered to your inbox every weekday morning.Email AddressEmail AddressSubscribeI have read and agree to yourPrivacy Policy.Related Content'Assad can't clean up his act with a natural disaster,' US Amb.

She describes herself as a "life-long Ronald Reagan old-school conservative.
It's all about the money for me," she saidMillion-dollar cars from Scottsdale AuctionsShe's unlikely to get anything like a million dollars, said Craig Jackson, president of the Barrett-Jackson auto auction company.
Maybe this car would be worth $50,000 to $100,000.
The hearse which carried the body of John F. Kennedy following his 1963 assassination in Dallas recentlysold at a Barrett-Jackson auction for $160,000.Jackson's company has sold several presidential cars and none have ever brought anything approaching that kind of money, he said.0:00/01:26127 year old car sold for $4.6 millionIt might help if the car, itself, were innately rare or valuable, but it's not.
The car is a stock late-model Chrysler very similar to many thousands of others that are still on the road.
With no presidential connection, it would be worth about $20,000 as a used car.Also, history has yet to render a verdict on Obama's presidency.A presidential parade limousine used by Franklin Roosevelt, a Cadillac V-16 convertible, was recently auctioned off at an RM Auctions sale in Arizona for $270,000.The eBay listing provides a few examples of other cars that have sold for surprising amounts, though.
A Peugeot once owned by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sold for £1.5 million pounds -- roughly $2.4 million.She also mentions a 1999 Volkswagen Golf once owned by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger -- now known as Pope Benedict XVI -- which sold for $244,000.Czibor provided CNNMoney with a scanned copy of an Illinois Certificate of Title showing Barack Obama as the lessee.
The car currently has 20,800 miles on it.She would not say how the car came into the current owner's possession.A spokesperson for the White House did not immediately comment on the eBay listing.Obama was a U.S.
Senator representing Illinois during the time he owned the car.
After driving the Chrysler sedan for over 19,000 miles Obama traded it for a 2007 Ford Escape Hybrid in the summer of 2007 as he was beginning his presidential campaign.The Chrysler gets about 18 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving, according to EPA estimates, while the Escape Hybrid gets about 30.First Published: January 26, 2012: 12:26 PM ETRelated ArticlesFisker Karma: Low-calorie sweetnessiReport: 'The best car I ever owned'GM ad campaign comes to Volt's defenseMost PopularWhat we want Apple to unveil at WWDCMillennials squeezed out of buying a home7 traits the rich have in commonBig Data knows you're sick, tired and depressedYour car is a giant computer - and it can be hackedFind Your Next CarNewUsedSelect a MakeSelect a MakeGet the latest car news:Vehicles That Can Get You 200,000 MilesThe Hottest Selling Cars In AmericaCool New Crossovers For 2015The Best New Car DealsHot ListWashington celebrates first pot-legal 4/20The high cost of autismLive texting your surgery15 of the chunkiest cars on the roadLive in a glass-walled home-->Contact UsClosed CaptioningManage Cookies+Site Map>Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

It was in that moment that she knew: "Life with Barack would never be dull," the former first lady wrote in her new book "Becoming.
The two had recently started dating, having met in 1989 after Barack took a summer position as an associate at Chicago law firm Sidley Austin where Michelle was a first-year lawyer.Barack, 28, lived frugally as a "loan-strapped" student.
Still, when she arrived in Cambridge, Massachusetts to visit after he returned to law school, she was surprised to see the condition of his rusted, beat up car, bought used on his student budget.
She asked, in awe, "You drive this thing?
Smiling, the future president turned the key in his Datsun.
The engine revved and the car spasmed violently before settling into a loud, sustained juddering that shook us in our seats," wrote Michelle.
Just give it a minute or two," he assured her.
It goes away.
After they waited for the car to start, Barack then warned her to avoid the "rusted-out, four-inch hole" in the car's floor.
Through it, Michelle said she "could see the pavement rushing beneath us.
The experience, combined with his confidence, charmed her.
At 25, Michelle found early success with law and the perks that came with it, including an office in a high-rise and her own assistant.
On her new salary, one higher than her parents ever made, she could now afford a brand new Saab and pay her student loans.
Still, despite her success and hard work, she said her passion for law was low.By contrast, Barack seemed assured of his path, even without Michelle's same "lockstep march" to success.
He didn't talk about buying material things, even shoes, and spent most of his money on books, "sacred objects," that he'd read late into the night.
Wrote Michelle, he was "like a unicorn.
It did occur to Michelle that Barack might never make any money, she wrote, but the idea of life with him seemed exciting.
It would be some version of banana yellow and slightly hair-raising," she wrote.
I knew it even then.
The two would marry in 1992.
Barack's vows would not promise riches, but only an interesting life.Said Michelle, "On that promise, he delivered.

2]PresidentBarack Obamaand his family were given the malePortuguese Water Dogas a gift after months of speculation about thebreedand identity of their future pet.
2][8]The final choice was made in part because elder daughterMalia's allergies dictated a need for ahypoallergenicbreed.
Bo was occasionally called "First Dog".
1][2][3]In August 2013, Bo was joined bySunny, a female dog of the same breed.
9]Bo was named by sisters Malia and Sasha after their cousins' cat, First LadyMichelle Obama's father, and as a reference to the R&B musicianBo Diddley.
Bo's name was also Barack Obama's initials.Breed background[edit]Main article:Portuguese Water DogThe Portuguese Water Dog is originally from the Algarve region of Portugal.
Only 48 Portuguese Water Dogs were entered for Britain'sCruftscompetition in the year 2009[10]and the author ofThe New Complete Portuguese Water Dog, Kitty Braund, believes there are about 50,000 in North America.
11]Due to its fleecy coat of minimally shedding hair,[12]the Portuguese Water Dog is considered ahypoallergenic dog breed.
13]Breeding and original owners[edit]The Obamas with BoBred by Martha and Art Stern of Amigo Portuguese Water Dogs in Boyd, Texas,[7]Bo was a son of Watson—of the Rader family in Pittsburgh's Ambridge suburb—and Penny, belonging to Art and Martha Stern.
One of Bo's nine litter mates was SenatorTed Kennedy's dog named Cappy (Amigo's Captain Courageous); the litter was named "Hope and Change", in honor of Obama'svictory.
14][15]Bo's original buyer is unknown, but eventually they returned him to the Stern family; purchasing Bo required signing a contract to return him to his breeder if things did not work out.
Bo enrolled with Kennedy'sobedience trainerDawn Sylvia-Stasiewiczin Hume, Virginia on January 5, 2009.
16]Selection of the dog[edit]At his first press conference asPresident-elect, Obama was questioned by reporters as to which breed the family was looking to acquire; he replied, "We have two criteria that have to be reconciled.
One is that Malia is allergic, so it has to be hypoallergenic.
There are a number of breeds that are hypoallergenic.
On the other hand, our preference would be to get a shelter dog, but, obviously, a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me.
So—so whether we're going to be able to balance those two things, I think, is a pressing issue on the Obama household.
17]George Stephanopoulosasked Obama on television in early January what kind of dog they would get, and when, saying that he was passing on a question from Obama's daughters who were sitting in the control room.
Obama said "They seem to have narrowed it down to alabradoodleor aPortuguese water hound... medium-sized dog, and so, we're now going to start looking atsheltersto see when one of those dogs might come up.
18]Much was made by the public and press about the family's search for a dog.
On April 12, 2009, it was announced that the Obamas would soon accept a six-month-old Portuguese Water Dog puppy as a gift from Senator Kennedy.
The dog was reported to have visited the family some weeks earlier[19]in a secret meeting to gauge compatibility and purportedly referred to by staffers as "The Meeting".
However, the gift was not accepted until the dog officially arrived and moved in at theWhite Houseon Tuesday, April 14, 2009.
20]Immediately after he arrived, the family staged aphoto opwith Bo on the property'sSouth Lawn.
21]At the conference, Obama was asked if he would allow Bo inside theOval Office, to which he responded: "of course.
21]He also gave a nod to PresidentHarry Truman's quote "If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.
21]The White House website was later updated to include official pictures and biographical details of Bo.
2]Biographical details[edit]Bo wearing aleiupon his White House arrivalListed by the name "Amigo's New Hope" withAmerican Kennel Club's breed registry[22]and given the name "Charlie" by his original owners,[23]the puppy received his name from President Obama's two daughters,Malia and Sasha, in part after their cousins' cat andMichelle Obama'sfather's nickname Diddley; the dog is a namesake of singerBo Diddley.
24][25]In June 2009, the White House released a baseball card for Bo with his new official portrait on one side and tongue-in-cheek statistics on the other; information included the facts that Bo's favorite food is tomatoes and that he does not yet know how to swim.
The card was available by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the White House.
26][27][28]According to financial disclosure forms released by President Obama in 2010, Bo was purchased for $1,600 (equivalent to $1,990 in 2021).
29]As of August 2012, Bo was on a diet, though no other details were released (it was announced by the President during the Kids' State Dinner, where children from the states and territories who had won a contest to design healthy, appealing meals had lunch at the White House).
30]Bo's heritage[edit]The Obamas walking with BoThe Obamas had voiced a strong desire to adopt ashelter dog, but made no firm commitments.
31]In Summer 2008,Best Friends Animal Society, an animal welfare organization, gathered 50,000 signatures on a petition asking the family to adopt a shelter animal.
32]Bo was a gift through a breeder, not a shelter dog.
Dog expertCésar Millánstated Bo could be considered part of a larger group known as "rescue dogs".
He was unsuccessful in his first home when plans for him to provide companionship to an older female dog went awry; apparently his attempts tosuckleirritated her.
20][33]The Obamas pledged a donation to the DC Humane Society in a show of support for shelter dogs.
34]TheHumane Society of the United Statesreleased a statement thanking the Obamas "for taking in a second-chance dog," but discouraged employing breeders.
35]Reactions in the media[edit]Bo and Obama running through the east wing of theWhite HouseBo in March 2010The Washington Post's Manuel Roig-Franzia, granted exclusive access to Bo for his debut in print, described the puppy: "Bo's a handsome little guy.
Well suited for formal occasions at theWhite House, he's got tuxedo-black fur, with a white chest, white paws and a rakish white goatee.
36]People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals(PETA) described the family's choice to accept the gift of a puppy from a family friend as "disquieting" and publicly urged Obama to have Bo neutered, despite the dog having been neutered before the Obamas received him.
37][38]In anticipation of increased interest in the breed, the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America issued a statement requesting that members of the public considering obtaining the dogs "ensure that this breed fits their lifestyle", advising that the dogs' needs preclude their being left alone for long periods or boarded in kennels.
39]Immediately upon Bo joining the First Family, four children's books and aplush toydepicting him were slated for publication or manufacture.
40][41][42]On July 17, 2009,Ben Greenman, writing inThe New York Timesas Bo, reflected on his first hundred days in office.
43]In the final episode of theHistory Channel'sLife After People, aired March 16, 2010, the producers imagined what life would be like for Bo after the disappearance of humanity.
44]This program speculated that he would leave the White House, and live off seafood from the Chesapeake Bay.
45]Bo was also shown onDogs 101, as part of segment about the breed.
46][47]Bo appeared in the comic bookLockjaw and the Pet Avengersand on the television showsLate Night with Seth MeyersandEllen.
On Meyers' show, Bo was the subject of a "Barney Cam" parody in which he is shown to be shamelessly manipulating White House staffers and guests (such as by finding and planting classified information in the bag of a speechwriter who refused to give him treats).
48]Bo acquired the nickname "Bobama".
49][50][51]Kidnapping plot[edit]On January 8, 2016, a man named Scott Stockert fromDickinson, North Dakotawas arrested for allegedly trying to kidnap Bo afterUnited States Secret ServiceAgents discovered a12 gaugepump actionshotgun and abolt action.22 caliberrifle on the back of his pickup truck.
52]Death[edit]On May 8, 2021, the Obama family confirmed that Bo had died ofcancerinWashington, D.C.at the age of 12.

Edward M. Kennedy, who owns several Portuguese water dogs himself.
We couldn't be happier to see the joy that Bo is bringing to Malia and Sasha," Kennedy said in a statement.
We love our Portuguese water dogs and know that the girls - and their parents - will love theirs, too.
The Washington Post reported in its online editions Saturday night that Mr. Obama's daughters chose the name Bo for the pup because first lady Michelle Obama's father was nicknamed Diddley.
The name for the dog was an apparent reference to the singer "Bo" Diddley.White House aides told the AP that the office of the first lady arranged an exclusive deal on the dog story with the Post.
The officials, who demanded anonymity because of the deal with the Post on exclusive details, said the dog was not in the White House as of Saturday evening.Throughout the day Saturday, celebrity Web sites and bloggers were abuzz with rumors of the first family's selection of a Portuguese water dog; one site even claimed it had pictures of the future first pet.The president had embraced the frenzy: "Oh, man, now, that's top secret," President Obama joked Friday to reporters.Mr.
Obama promised his daughters a puppy during the presidential campaign.
This is Washington.
That was a campaign promise," Mr. Obama said when he appeared on Jay Leno's television talk show last month, as the audience roared with laughter.
No, I'm teasing.
The dog will be there shortly.
The president and first lady had said their choice was down to either a Portuguese water dog or a Labradoodle because they were considered good pets for children who have allergies, as Malia does.By Associated Press Writer Philip ElliottTrending NewsTruck crashes carrying 40,000 pounds of toxic soil from East PalestineMelania Trump makes first statement since husband's indictmentAfghanistan military working dog and Army handler reunited in U.S."Unprecedented" sea level rise observed along U.S. coastsPlane passenger arrested, charged after Alaska Airlines flight makes diversionFirst published on April 12, 2009 / 10:51 AM© 2009 The Associated Press.

Payne(uncle)Stanley Ann Dunham(November 29, 1942 – November 7, 1995) was an Americananthropologistwho specialized in theeconomic anthropologyandrural developmentof Indonesia.
1]She is the mother ofBarack Obama, the44th president of the United States.
Dunham was known as Stanley Ann Dunham through high school, then as Ann Dunham, Ann Obama, Ann Soetoro, a.k.a.
Ann Sutoro, and resumed her maiden name, Ann Dunham, later in life.
2]Born inWichita, Kansas, Dunham studied at theEast–West Centerand at theUniversity of Hawaiʻi at MānoainHonolulu, where she attained a bachelor of arts degree in anthropology (1967),[3]and later received master of arts (1974) and PhD (1992) degrees, also in anthropology.
4]She also attended theUniversity of WashingtoninSeattlefrom 1961 to 1962.
Interested in craftsmanship, weaving, and the role of women incottage industries, Dunham's research focused on women's work on the island ofJavaand blacksmithing in Indonesia.
To address the problem of poverty in rural villages, she createdmicrocreditprograms while working as a consultant for theUnited States Agency for International Development.
Dunham was also employed by theFord FoundationinJakartaand she consulted with theAsian Development BankinGujranwala, Pakistan.
Towards the latter part of her life, she worked withBank Rakyat Indonesia, where she helped apply her research to the largestmicrofinanceprogram in the world.
4]After her son was elected president, interest renewed in Dunham's work: the University ofHawaiʻiheld a symposium about her research; an exhibition of Dunham's Indonesianbatiktextile collection toured the United States; and in December 2009,Duke University PresspublishedSurviving against the Odds: Village Industry in Indonesia, a book based on Dunham's original 1992 dissertation.
Janny Scott, an author and formerNew York Timesreporter, published a biography of her titledA Singular Womanin 2011.
Posthumous interest has also led to the creation of the Ann Dunham Soetoro Endowment in the Anthropology Department at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, as well as the Ann Dunham Soetoro Graduate Fellowships, intended to fund students associated with the East–West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii.
5]In an interview, Barack Obama referred to his mother as "the dominant figure in my formative years ...
The values she taught me continue to be my touchstone when it comes to how I go about the world of politics.
6]Early life[edit]Dunham was born on November 29, 1942, at St. Francis Hospital inWichita, Kansas,[7]the only child ofMadelyn Lee PayneandStanley Armour Dunham.
8]She was of predominantly English ancestry, with some Scottish, Welsh, Irish,Germanand Swiss.
9]Wild Bill Hickokis her sixth cousin, five times removed.
10]Ancestry.comannounced on July 30, 2012, after using a combination of old documents andyDNAanalysis, that Dunham's mother was descended fromJohn Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in seventeenth-century colonialVirginia.
11][12]Her parents were born in Kansas and met in Wichita, where they married on May 5, 1940.
13]After theattack on Pearl Harbor, her father joined theUnited States Armyand her mother worked at aBoeingplant in Wichita.
14]According to Dunham, she was named after her father because he wanted a son, though her relatives doubt this story and her maternal uncle recalled that her mother named Dunham after her favorite actressBette Davis' character in the filmIn This Our Lifebecause she thought Stanley, as a girl's name, sounded sophisticated.
15]As a child and teenager she was known as Stanley.
2]Other children teased her about her name.
Nonetheless, she used it through high school, "apologizing for it each time she introduced herself in a new town.
16]By the time Dunham began attending college, she was known by her middle name, Ann, instead.
2]AfterWorld War II, Dunham's family moved from Wichita toCaliforniawhile her father attended theUniversity of California, Berkeley.
In 1948, they moved toPonca City, Oklahoma, and from there toVernon, Texas, and then toEl Dorado, Kansas.
17]In 1955, the family moved toSeattle,Washington, where her father was employed as a furniture salesman and her mother worked as vice president of a bank.
They lived in an apartment complex in theWedgwoodneighborhood where she attendedNathan Eckstein Junior High School.
18]In 1957, Dunham's family moved toMercer Island, anEastsidesuburb of Seattle.
Dunham's parents wanted their 13-year-old daughter to attend the newly openedMercer Island High School.
6]At the school, teachers Val Foubert and Jim Wichterman taught the importance of challenging social norms and questioning authority to the young Dunham, and she took the lessons to heart: "She felt she didn't need to date or marry or have children."
One classmate remembered her as "intellectually way more mature than we were and a little bit ahead of her time, in an off-center way",[6]and a high school friend described her as knowledgeable and progressive: "If you were concerned about something going wrong in the world, Stanley would know about it first.
We were liberals before we knew what liberals were."
Another called her "the original feminist".
6]She went through high school "reading beatnik poets and French existentialists".

16]Second marriage[edit]It was at theEast–West Centerthat Dunham metLolo Soetoro,[33]aJavanese[4]surveyor who had come to Honolulu in September 1962 on an East–West Center grant to study geography at the University of Hawaii.
Soetoro graduated from the University of Hawaii with an MA in geography in June 1964.
In 1965, Soetoro and Dunham were married in Hawaii, and in 1966, Soetoro returned toIndonesia.
Dunham graduated from the University of Hawaii with a B.A.
in anthropology on August 6, 1967, and moved in October the same year with her six-year-old son toJakarta, Indonesia, to rejoin her husband.
34]In Indonesia, Soetoro worked first as a low-paid topographical surveyor for the Indonesian government, and later in the government relations office ofUnion Oil Company.
21][35]The family first lived at 16 Kyai Haji Ramli Tengah Street in a newly built neighborhood in the Menteng Dalamadministrative villageof theTebetsubdistrictinSouth Jakartafor two and a half years, with her son attending the nearby Indonesian-language Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi) Catholic School for 1st, 2nd, and part of 3rd grade, then in 1970 moved two miles north to 22 Taman Amir Hamzah Street in the Matraman Dalam neighborhood in the Pegangsaan administrative village of theMentengsubdistrict inCentral Jakarta, with her son attending the Indonesian-language government-runBesuki Schoolone and half miles east in the exclusiveMenteng administrative villageof the Menteng subdistrict for part of 3rd grade and for 4th grade.
36][37]On August 15, 1970, Soetoro and Dunham had a daughter,Maya Kassandra Soetoro.
13]In Indonesia, Dunham enriched her son's education withcorrespondence coursesin English, recordings ofMahalia Jackson, and speeches byMartin Luther King Jr.In 1971, she sent the young Obama back to Hawaii to attendPunahou Schoolstarting in 5th grade rather than having him stay in Indonesia with her.
34]Madelyn Dunham's job at theBank of Hawaii, where she had worked her way up over a decade from clerk to becoming one of its first two female vice presidents in 1970, helped pay the steep tuition,[38]with some assistance from a scholarship.
39]A year later, in August 1972, Dunham and her daughter moved back to Hawaii to rejoin her son and begin graduate study in anthropology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
Dunham's graduate work was supported by anAsia Foundationgrant from August 1972 to July 1973 and by an East–West Center Technology and Development Institute grant from August 1973 to December 1978.
40]Dunham completed her coursework at the University of Hawaii for an M.A.
in anthropology in December 1974,[4]and after having spent three years in Hawaii, Dunham, accompanied by her daughter Maya, returned to Indonesia in 1975 to do anthropological field work.
40][41]Her son chose not to go with them back to Indonesia, preferring to finish high school at Punahou School in Honolulu while living with his grandparents.
42]Lolo Soetoro and Dunham divorced on November 5, 1980; Lolo Soetoro married Erna Kustina in 1980 and had two children, a son, Yusuf Aji Soetoro (born 1981), and daughter, Rahayu Nurmaida Soetoro (born 1987).
Lolo Soetoro died, age 52, on March 2, 1987, due to liver failure.
43]Dunham was not estranged from either ex-husband and encouraged her children to feel connected to their fathers.
44]Professional life[edit]From January 1968 to December 1969, Dunham taught English and was an assistant director of the Lembaga Persahabatan Indonesia Amerika (LIA)–the Indonesia-America Friendship Institute at 9 Teuku Umar Street in theGondangdiaadministrative village of theMentengsubdistrict inCentral Jakarta–which was subsidized by the United States government.
40]From January 1970 to August 1972, Dunham taught English and was a department head and a director of the Lembaga Pendidikan dan Pengembangan Manajemen (LPPM)–the Institute of Management Education and Development at 9 Menteng Raya Street in theKebon Sirihadministrative village of the Menteng subdistrict in Central Jakarta.
40]From 1968 to 1972, Dunham was a co-founder and active member of the Ganesha Volunteers (Indonesian Heritage Society) at theNational Museumin Jakarta.
40][45]From 1972 to 1975, Dunham was crafts instructor (in weaving,batik, and dye) at theBishop Museumin Honolulu.
40]Dunham then had a career inrural development, championing women's work andmicrocreditfor the world's poor and worked with leaders from organizations supportingIndonesian human rights,women's rights, and grass-rootsdevelopment.
34]In March 1977, Dunham, under the supervision of agricultural economics professor Leon A. Mears, developed and taught a short lecture course at the Faculty of Economics of theUniversity of Indonesia(FEUI) in Jakarta for staff members ofBAPPENAS(Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional)—the Indonesian National Development Planning Agency.
40]From June 1977 through September 1978, Dunham carried out research on village industries in the Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (DIY)—theYogyakarta Special RegionwithinCentral Javain Indonesia under a student grant from the East–West Center.
46]As aweaverherself, Dunham was interested in village industries, and moved toYogyakarta City, the center ofJavanesehandicrafts.
41][47]In May and June 1978, Dunham was a short-term consultant in the office of theInternational Labour Organization(ILO) in Jakarta, writing recommendations on village industries and other non-agricultural enterprises for the Indonesian government's third five-year development plan (REPELITA III).
40][46]From October 1978 to December 1980, Dunham was a rural industries consultant in Central Java on theIndonesian Ministry of Industry's Provincial Development Program (PDP I), funded byUSAIDin Jakarta and implemented throughDevelopment Alternatives, Inc.(DAI).
40][46]From January 1981 to November 1984, Dunham was the program officer for women and employment in theFord Foundation's Southeast Asia regional office in Jakarta.
40][46]While at the Ford Foundation, she developed a model ofmicrofinancewhich is now the standard in Indonesia, a country that is a world leader in micro-credit systems.
48]Peter Geithner, father ofTim Geithner(who later becameU.S.
Secretary of the Treasuryin her son's administration), was head of the foundation's Asia grant-making at that time.
49]From May to November 1986 and from August to November 1987, Dunham was a cottage industries development consultant for theAgricultural Development Bank of Pakistan(ADBP) under the Gujranwala Integrated Rural Development Project (GADP).
40][46]The credit component of the project was implemented in theGujranwaladistrict of thePunjabprovince ofPakistanwith funding from theAsian Development BankandIFAD, with the credit component implemented throughLouis Berger International, Inc.[40][46]Dunham worked closely with theLahoreoffice of the Punjab Small Industries Corporation (PSIC).
40][46]From January 1988 to 1995, Dunham was a consultant and research coordinator for Indonesia's oldest bank,Bank Rakyat Indonesia(BRI) in Jakarta, with her work funded by USAID and theWorld Bank.
40][46]In March 1993, Dunham was a research and policy coordinator forWomen's World Banking(WWB) in New York.
40]She helped WWB manage the Expert Group Meeting on Women and Finance in New York in January 1994, and helped the WWB take prominent roles in the UN'sFourth World Conference on Womenheld September 4–15, 1995 inBeijing, and in the UN regional conferences and NGO forums that preceded it.
40]On August 9, 1992, she was awardedPhDinanthropologyfrom the University of Hawaii, under the supervision of Prof.Alice G. Dewey, with a 1,043-page dissertation[50]titledPeasant blacksmithing in Indonesia: surviving and thriving against all odds.
51]Anthropologist Michael Dove described the dissertation as "a classic, in-depth, on-the-ground anthropological study of a 1,200-year-old industry".
52]According to Dove, Dunham's dissertation challenged popular perceptions regarding economically and politically marginalized groups, and countered the notions that the roots of poverty lie with the poor themselves and that cultural differences are responsible for the gap between less-developed countries and the industrialized West.
52]According to Dove, Dunhamfound that the villagers she studied in Central Java had many of the same economic needs, beliefs and aspirations as the most capitalist of Westerners.
Village craftsmen were "keenly interested in profits", she wrote, and entrepreneurship was "in plentiful supply in rural Indonesia", having been "part of the traditional culture" there for a millennium.Based on these observations, Dr. Soetoro concluded that underdevelopment in these communities resulted from a scarcity of capital, the allocation of which was a matter of politics, not culture.
Antipoverty programs that ignored this reality had the potential, perversely, of exacerbating inequality because they would only reinforce the power of elites.
As she wrote in her dissertation, "many government programs inadvertently foster stratification by channeling resources through village officials", who then used the money to strengthen their own status further.
52]Dunham produced a large amount of professional papers that are held in collections of theNational Anthropological Archives(NAA).
Her daughter donated a collection of them that is categorized as theS.
Ann Dunham papers, 1965-2013.
This collection contains case studies, correspondence, field notebooks, lectures, photographs, reports, research files, research proposals, surveys, and floppy disks documenting her dissertation research on blacksmithing, as well as her professional work as a consultant for organizations such as the Ford Foundation and the Bank Raykat Indonesia (BRI).
They are housed at theSmithsonian National Museum of Natural History.Her field notes have been digitized and, in 2020,Smithsonian Magazinenoted that an effort had been established for a project to transcribe them.
53]Public participation in the transcription project was announced at the same time.Illness and death[edit]In late 1994, Dunham was living and working in Indonesia.
One night, during dinner at a friend's house in Jakarta, she experienced stomach pain.
A visit to a local physician led to an initial diagnosis of indigestion.
16]Dunham returned to the United States in early 1995 and was examined at theMemorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Centerin New York City and diagnosed withuterine cancer.
By this time, the cancer had spread to her ovaries.
21]She moved back to Hawaii to live near her widowed mother and died on November 7, 1995, 22 days short of her 53rd birthday.
54][55][34][56][57]Following a memorial service at the University of Hawaii, Obama and his sister spread their mother's ashes in the Pacific Ocean atLanai Lookouton the south side ofOahu.
34]Obama scattered the ashes of his grandmotherMadelyn Dunhamin the same spot on December 23, 2008, weeks after his election to the presidency.
58]Obama talked about Dunham's death in a 30-second campaign advertisement ("Mother") arguing for health care reform.
The ad featured a photograph of Dunham holding a young Obama in her arms as Obama talks about her last days worrying about expensive medical bills.
57]The topic also came up in a 2007 speech inSanta Barbara:[57]I remember my mother.
She was 52 years old when she died of ovarian cancer, and you know what she was thinking about in the last months of her life?
She wasn't thinking about getting well.
She wasn't thinking about coming to terms with her own mortality.
She had been diagnosed just as she was transitioning between jobs.
And she wasn't sure whether insurance was going to cover the medical expenses because they might consider this a preexisting condition.
I remember just being heartbroken, seeing her struggle through the paperwork and the medical bills and the insurance forms.
So, I have seen what it's like when somebody you love is suffering because of a broken health care system.
And it's wrong.
It's not who we are as a people.
57]Dunham's employer-provided health insurance covered most of the costs of her medical treatment, leaving her to pay the deductible and uncovered expenses, which came to several hundred dollars per month.
59]Her employer-provided disability insurance denied her claims for uncovered expenses because the insurance company said her cancer was apreexisting condition.
59]Posthumous interest[edit]In September 2008, theUniversity of Hawaii at Mānoaheld a symposium about Dunham.
60]In December 2009,Duke University Presspublished a version of Dunham's dissertation titledSurviving against the Odds: Village Industry in Indonesia.The book was revised and edited by Dunham's graduate advisor,Alice G. Dewey, and Nancy I. Cooper.
Dunham's daughter,Maya Soetoro-Ng, wrote the foreword for the book.
In his afterword,Boston Universityanthropologist Robert W. Hefner describes Dunham's research as "prescient" and her legacy as "relevant today for anthropology, Indonesian studies, and engaged scholarship".
61]The book was launched at the 2009 annual meeting of theAmerican Anthropological Associationin Philadelphia with a special Presidential Panel on Dunham's work; The 2009 meeting was taped byC-SPAN.
62]In 2009, an exhibition of Dunham's Javanesebatiktextile collection (A Lady Found a Culture in its Cloth: Barack Obama's Mother and Indonesian Batiks) toured six museums in the United States, finishing the tour at theTextile Museumof Washington, D.C., in August.
63]Early in her life, Dunham explored her interest in the textile arts as a weaver, creating wall hangings for her own enjoyment.
After moving to Indonesia, she was attracted to the striking textile art of the batik and began to collect a variety of different fabrics.
64]In December 2010 Dunham was awarded theBintang JasaUtama,Indonesia's highest civilian award; the Bintang Jasa is awarded at three levels, and is presented to those individuals who have made notable civic and cultural contributions.
65]A lengthy major biography of Dunham by formerNew York Timesreporter Janny Scott, titledA Singular Woman, was published in 2011.The University of Hawaii Foundation has established the Ann Dunham Soetoro Endowment, which supports a faculty position housed in the Anthropology Department at theUniversity of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, and the Ann Dunham Soetoro Graduate Fellowships, providing funding for students associated with theEast–West Center(EWC) inHonolulu, Hawaii.
5]In 2010 the Stanley Ann Dunham Scholarship was established for young women graduating from Mercer Island High School, Ann's alma mater.
In its first six years the scholarship fund has awarded eleven college scholarships.
66]On January 1, 2012, President Obama and his family visited an exhibition of his mother's anthropological work on display at theEast–West Center.
67]Filmmaker Vivian Norris's feature length biographical film of Ann Dunham entitledObama Mama(La mère d'Obama-French title) premiered on May 31, 2014, as part of the 40th annual Seattle International Film Festival, not far from where Dunham grew up on Mercer Island.
68]Personal beliefs[edit]In his 1995 memoirDreams from My Father, Barack Obama wrote, "My mother's confidence in needlepoint virtues depended on a faith I didn't possess...
In a land [Indonesia] where fatalism remained a necessary tool for enduring hardship ... she was a lonely witness forsecular humanism, a soldier forNew Deal,Peace Corps, position-paper liberalism.
69]In his 2006 bookThe Audacity of HopeObama wrote, "I was not raised in a religious household ... My mother's own experiences ... only reinforced this inherited skepticism.
Her memories of the Christians who populated her youth were not fond ones ... And yet for all her professed secularism, my mother was in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I've ever known.
70]"Religion for her was "just one of the many ways—and not necessarily the best way—that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives," Obama wrote.
71]She felt that somehow, wandering through uncharted territory, we might stumble upon something that will, in an instant, seem to represent who we are at the core.
That was very much her philosophy of life—to not be limited by fear or narrow definitions, to not build walls around ourselves and to do our best to find kinship and beauty in unexpected places.—Maya Soetoro-Ng[34]Dunham's best friend in high school, Maxine Box, said that Dunham "touted herself as an atheist, and it was something she'd read about and could argue.
She was always challenging and arguing and comparing.
She was already thinking about things that the rest of us hadn't.
6][72]On the other hand, Dunham's daughter, Maya Soetoro-Ng, when asked later if her mother was an atheist, said, "I wouldn't have called her an atheist.
She was an agnostic.
She basically gave us all the good books—the Bible, the HinduUpanishadsand theBuddhist scripture, theTao Te Ching—and wanted us to recognize that everyone has something beautiful to contribute.
33]"Jesus, she felt, was a wonderful example.
But she felt that a lot of Christians behaved in un-Christian ways.
71]In a 2007 speech, Obama contrasted the beliefs of his mother to those of her parents, and commented on her spirituality and skepticism: "My mother, whose parents were nonpracticing Baptists and Methodists, was one of the most spiritual souls I ever knew.
But she had a healthy skepticism of religion as an institution.
16]Obama also described his own beliefs in relation to the religious upbringing of his mother and father:My father was from Kenya and a lot of people in his village were Muslim.
He didn't practice Islam.
Truth is he wasn't very religious.
He met my mother.
My mother was a Christian from Kansas, and they married and then divorced.
I was raised by my mother.
So, I've always been a Christian.
The only connection I've had to Islam is that my grandfather on my father's side came from that country.
But I've never practiced Islam.

Then she kept her husband's name but modernized the spelling to Sutoro.
In the early 1980s, she was Ann Sutoro, Ann Dunham Sutoro, S. Ann Dunham Sutoro.
In conversation, Indonesians who worked with her in the late 1980s and early 1990s referred to her as Ann Dunham, putting the emphasis on the second syllable of the surname.

Five Unordinary Facts About President Obama's Mother - ABC NewsABC NewsVideoLiveShowsGuns in AmericaInterest Successfully AddedWe'll notify you here with news aboutTurn on desktop notifications for breaking stories about interest?OffOnLOG INStream onFive Unordinary Facts About President Obama's MotherAnn Dunham was an unorthodox mother, to say the least.ByAMY BINGHAMMay 11, 2012, 5:37 PMMay 12, 2012 --intro: This Mother's Day, as Sasha and Malia Obama present their mom withhandmade giftsat the White House, the stark contrasts between President Obama's family now and his family as a child growing up in Hawaii could not be more apparent.Whereas the president and the first lady have been married for 20 years, his mother and father were married for four.
Throughout the first decade of his daughters' lives the family has lived in two cities, Chicago and Washington, D.C. By the time he was 10, Obama had lived in two countries.While Obama has put down the strongest of roots, his mother opted for wings, never staying in one place, let alone one country, for long.
I never imagined that an American president would have a mother who had done the things that she did," Janny Scott, who wrote a biography of Obama's mother, toldThe New York Times.And in her biography, "A Singular Woman," Scott quoted the president.
His mother had given him, he said, "a sense of unconditional love that was big enough that, with all the surface disturbances of our lives, it sustained me, entirely.
Here are five facts that make President Obama's mother no ordinary mom.quicklist:title:She lived in five states and three countriestext: Ann Dunham's family moved five times before Ann, or Stanley, as she was called in her childhood, turned 18, bouncing from Wichita, Kans., to California to Texas to Seattle and, finally, to Hawaii.As an adult Dunham adopted her parents' knack for nomadism, splitting most of her adult life between Hawaii and Indonesia, and briefly taking up residence in Pakistan, where she helped establish a microfinance program for women.Her son, on the other hand, took the opposite approach, putting down roots in Chicago and firmly planting himself and his family in the U.S."We've created stability for our kids in a way that my mom didn't do for us," Obama toldTime magazineduring his 2008 presidential campaign.
My choosing to put down roots in Chicago and marry a woman who is very rooted in one place probably indicates a desire for stability that maybe I was missing.
quicklist:title:Her first name is actually Stanleytext: President Obama's mother's full name is Stanley Ann Dunham.
Although she used her middle name for the majority of her adult life, Dunham went by Stanley throughout grade school, the name that her father, who wanted a son, gave her.Over the course of Dunham's short life -- she died when she was in her early 50s -- she went byfour different names.
Growing up it was Stanley Dunham.
In college she was Ann Dunham.
During her first marriage, to Barack Obama's father, she was Ann Obama.
And after her second marriage she was Ann Soetoro.quicklist:title: She was 18 when Barack Obama was borntext:President Obama's mother married his father at the ripe young age of 18, after the two met in a Russian-language class at the University of Hawaii.
At the time, interracial marriage was illegal in most states.Dunham was three months pregnant when the two tied the knot in a ceremony so discrete that her son never uncovered any records of the event, according toScott's biographyof Dunham, "A Singular Woman.
By the time Obama was a year old, his father, Barack Obama Sr., had moved from Hawaii to Massachusetts to get a masters degree from Harvard.
By the time he was six, he had moved with his mother to Indonesia after she married Lolo Soetoro.
The couple had a daughter, Maya Soetoro, before they divorced in 1980.quicklist:title: She was only five years older than Hillary Clintontext: Born in 1942, as World War II was ravaging the world, Obama's mother was a mere five years older than Hillary Clinton, whom he would later defeat in a bitter Democratic primary during his race for the White House.Dunham died a few weeks short of her 53rd birthday, of uterine and ovarian cancer, two years before her son was elected to the Illinois state senate.quicklist:title: She had a Ph.D. in anthropologytext: It may have taken her two decades and countless trips back-and-forth between Indonesia and the University of Hawaii to complete, but in 1992 Ann Dunham was awarded her Ph.D. inanthropology.Her 1,000-page dissertation explored the indigenous craft of blacksmithing in Indonesia, a topic she had studied for more than 20 years.
She died two years after completing it.She had instilled in her son the importance of education, making him rise before the sun came up to do his homework.
She would tell people that her son was gifted, "that he can do anything he ever wants in the world, even be president of the United States.

She was less than two years older than the president is now.
Her death from uterine cancer came between two key events in her son’s life.
Four months earlier “Dreams From My Father” had been published; it seemed destined to drown unnoticed in the deep ocean of books.
One year later Obama won his first election, to the Illinois state Senate, the initial stop on his swift journey to the White House that, along the way, brought a mass audience to that forgotten memoir, which in its best-selling revival defined his political image and provided him with lifelong financial security.The title of the book was at once understandable and misleading.
Obama barely knew his father except in dreams, or nightmares.
He spent time with the old man only once, when he was 10, for an unsatisfying month.
It is harsh to say but nonetheless likely that Barack Obama II was lucky never to have lived with Barack Obama Sr., an abusive alcoholic.
By far the most influential figures in Obama’s early life were his mother and grandmother.
He has some of the demeanor of his grandmother and the will and much of the outlook of his mother.
Dreams From My Mother” better evokes his life’s story.She was a woman of many names.
Born Stanley Ann Dunham, she assumed, as most people did, that her unusual first name was imposed by her father.
An uncle tells a different story, attributing the choice to Madelyn Dunham, Stanley Ann’s mother, who as a small-town Kansas girl yearned to emulate Bette Davis, the sophisticated actress she saw on the big screen at the air-conditioned Augusta Theater.
While Madelyn was pregnant, Davis was starring in a movie in which she played a female character named Stanley.
As it happened, no two people could have been less alike than Madelyn’s daughter and this film character, who was cruel, cunning and racist.)
Stanley Ann became Stannie Ann in grade school, Stanley in high school and, finally, Ann in adulthood.
Her last name changed as often, from Dunham to Obama to Soetoro to a final spelling of Sutoro.By any name, she was a searcher.
She married a Kenyan and an Indonesian (both marriages collapsed; the first quickly, the second slowly) and spent most of her adult life overseas.
She was constantly on the move.
She earned a doctorate in anthropology and had an anthropologist’s nature as a participant observer, a character trait shared by her son.
She was fascinated by other cultures and ways of living.
A polyglot, she could speak Bahasa Indonesia fluently and had a working knowledge of Urdu, Hindi, Javanese, French and Latin.
There was never a foreign film she did not want to see, a batik dress she did not want to wear, a mythology she did not wish to understand.
In Indonesia, where she spent most of her adult life, she became obsessed with the work of rural blacksmiths, who were said to forge human souls.
She devoted herself later to helping Javanese women maintain their handicraft livelihoods in a male-dominated society that practiced what she called “the gentle oppression” of women.
She would wake up before dawn every morning and, in notebooks with the black-and-white speckled covers, record her travels, her encounters and her hopes for people, including her only son.Barack Obama’s relationship with his mother was complicated.
She called him Barry or Bar (sounds like bear).
She pushed him to be serious and to look at people with empathy.
He always felt protective of her, according to his memoir.
He describes a scene in which she told him that she intended to marry Lolo Soetoro and that, after the marriage, they would all live in Indonesia.
As Obama recalls it, he turned to her and asked, “But do you love him?” — a question that made her chin tremble.
It was, at the least, precocious.
At the time he was only 31/2.
But it was also in keeping with one of the themes that weaves through his dealings with his mother over the years — that she was naive and idealistic, sometimes too good for her own good.
In the journal that his New York girlfriend, Genevieve Cook, kept during their time together in the early 1980s, Cook wrote, “Told me the other night of having pushed his mother away over past 2 years in an effort to extract himself from the role of supporting man in her life — she feels rejected and has withdrawn somewhat.”Ann once joked that she had children with a Kenyan and an Indonesian so that the kids would not have light skin and get sunburns.
She herself looked like a Kansas schoolmarm, she noted, which made it easy for her to sail through Customs during her foreign comings and goings.
Barry, thehapaKenyan, and his little sister Maya, thehapaIndonesian, could never say the same.
The mother and her two children struggled to find their identities, but in very different ways.
Ann found hers through her work and travels, a lifestyle that, among other things, meant she and her son were apart for most of his adolescence, he in Honolulu with his grandparents, she in Indonesia.
The search for identity was more psychological for her children, something that Maya said her mother must have understood but never fully acknowledged.
In her career, Ann was idealistic but not naive.
If she at times came across as naive to her children, it was in the role of a mother not wanting her children to suffer.“She made sure that laughter was the prevailing form of communication and that nothing ever became acrimonious and that everything was pretty and everything was sacred,” Maya told me during an interview.
Maybe she didn’t want us to suffer with identity.
She wanted us to think of it as a gift.
The fact that we were multilayered and multidimensional and multiracial — it meant that she was perhaps unprepared when we did struggle with issues of identity.
She was not really able to help us grapple with that in any nuanced way.
Perhaps she felt that if she did acknowledge the difficulty of it, she would feel guilty.”No guilt on Mother’s Day.
Barack Obama’s mother, by any name, did not live to see her son’s rise, but she shaped the essence of this president.Read more from David Maraniss’s Political Lives series:Obama’s military connectionThe polygamists in Obama and Romney’s family treesThe parallel lives of Bill Clinton and Barack ObamaThe luck that propelled President Obama’s riseWe are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.David MaranissDavid Maraniss is an associate editor at The Washington Post, where he has worked since 1977.

Stuart Elementary School after President Barack Obama.
The changewas recommended by school district Superintendent Jason Kamras before earning the board’s endorsement, schools spokeswoman Kenita Bowers said.Kamras saw the renaming as an opportunity to honor a “prominent African American figure” who resonated with students, Bowers said, noting that the name is especially powerful given Richmond’s history: It was the capital of the Confederacy.“I’m thrilled that the students of J.E.B.
Stuart — who recommended Barack Obama as one of their top choices for the new name — will now have the opportunity to attend a school that honors a leader who represents the great promise of America,” Kamras said in a statement.After Charlottesville, some rally to take Confederate names off schoolsThecentral Virginiaelementary school becamethe latest Southern institution to reconsider Confederate imagery in public life.
That debate flared after an August rally by white supremacists and white nationalists in Charlottesville turned deadly.AdvertisementIn Richmond, school system officials solicited suggestions and feedback on the renaming online and during public meetings in May and June, Bowers said.
A renaming team consisting of teachers, students and administrators was assembled to spark community engagement.Student input was sought with a vote on the leading suggestions, and Obama generated the second-highest tally,according to school district documents.
The top choice was “Northside,” which is the neighborhood where the school sits.
Wishtree,” a bookread by studentsthat carries a message about tolerance, came in third.More than 320 students were enrolled at the elementary school, which is about 92 percent black, in the 2017-2018 academic year,according to state data.The renaming is expected to cost $26,000,with a stone facade, signs, stationery, and shirts for students and staff members updated with the new name,district documents state.AdvertisementSchool board Chairwoman Dawn Paige said having Obama’s name on the school would send a message to students that they could aspire to be president.“This process really meant a lot to our students, knowing that they had a say-so in the renaming of their school,” Paige said.One school board member, Kenya Gibson, who represents the elementary school’s neighborhood, voted against the renaming because she said shewanted to give community members more time to weigh in.Gibson said the names of influential local leaders could have surfaced as options with more time.
Still, she said she was thrilled that the school’s new name “more closely reflects the values that I hold and we hold as a city.”In the former capital of the Confederacy, the debate over statutes is personal and painfulBut, she said, the school system could do more to address what she views as other symbols of segregation, including decrepit school buildings; voters overwhelmingly approved a referendum in November to modernize the city’s school facilities without imposing additional taxes.
If we want to truly make good on the promise of equal education for all students, then we need to address these crumbling facilities,” Gibson said.AdvertisementThe renaming of the Richmond school happeneddays after New Haven, Conn., broke ground on the Barack H. Obama Magnet University School.The Fairfax School Board decided in the fall to renameJ.E.B.
Stuart High School, changing it to Justice High andending a two-year debate.
Name-change supporters insisted that it was inappropriate to honor a cavalry commander who fought to preserve slavery,while those who wanted to keep the Stuart name said the change was a costly effort that amounted to erasing history.CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleView moreLoading...TOP STORIESThe DMV GuideWhether you’re a lifelong resident of D.C. or you just moved here, we’ve got you covered.Capitals turn up, take on the role of spoilers and turn aside the IslandersHow a tight tie-dye glove helps Dominic Smith improve his defenseAt last, Josiah Gray is past the trade that brought him to the NationalsRefreshTry a different topicSign inorcreate a free accountto save your preferencesCompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)Today’s PaperPublic NoticesContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com© 1996-2023 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2023 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices

Most of Them Are SegregatedByCorey Mitchell&Alex Harwin—
        January 17, 20178 min readSchools across the country have honored President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama by “namesaking—“ naming schools in their honor.
These schools paint a panorama of a divided nation, one separated by race, class, and place.
More than 90 percent of students who attend the namesake schools are black and Latino.
Fewer than 4 percent are white.
Students at the Obama schools are nearly 60 percent more likely to qualify for free or low-cost meals than their peers nationwide, according to an Education Week Research Center analysis of federal data.
The schools are scattered throughout 11 states, concentrated on the East and West coasts, and are almost exclusively found in urban and suburban areas.Share articleRemoveSave to favoritesSave to favoritesPrintEmailFacebookLinkedInTwitterCopy URLNormandy, Mo.
As the presidency of Barack Obama comes to a close, the schools across the country named to honor him and first lady Michelle Obama paint a panorama of a divided nation, one separated by race, class, and place.Many are located in places like Normandy, a struggling St. Louis-area enclave where unemployment rates are high and high school graduation rates are low.The schools here are among the poorest and most segregated in Missouri.
All but a handful of the 400 students at Normandy’sBarack Obama Elementaryare black; almost all of them qualify for free or low-cost meals.The racial and economic segregation that persists here can be found in Obama-named schools across the nation, from Los Angeles to Long Island.More than 90 percent of students who attend the namesake schools are black and Latino.
Fewer than 4 percent are white.Students at the Obama schools are nearly 60 percent more likely to qualify for free or low-cost meals than their peers nationwide, according to an Education Week Research Center analysis of federal data.A rural-urban divide also stratifies the schools: scattered throughout 11 states, the Obama schools are almost exclusively found in urban and suburban areas with 250,000 or more residents.
They are concentrated on the East and West coasts and in metropolitan areas in the country’s mid-section, including three in the suburbs of President Obama’s adopted hometown of Chicago.
None have cropped up in the small towns and sparsely populated areas that cover wide swaths of the country.“When you look at the larger geography of naming schools, we do see a reaffirmation or reinforcement of segregated boundaries,” saidDerek Alderman, a geographer at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
School names matter.
It’s part of our larger way that we imagine ourselves and project our identities onto places and onto people.”‘What We Could Be’Naming schools for presidents has been Normandy’s tradition.
The district’s two other elementary schools honor Thomas Jefferson and George Washington.
The names of James Garfield and William Henry Harrison graced buildings in the past.
When those schools were named, Normandy was a mostly white, middle-class bedroom community.
Now more than 95 percent of the students in the district are black.The idea to name the district’s brand-new elementary school for the country’s first black president came from those students.Choosing Obama’s name felt different, more meaningful, students and staff say.
Not only because he’s black, but because his legacy is of the moment, not confined to a grainy black-and-white video or history book.“Not only is this person a president, but this person looks like us.
It represented what we could be or what the kids could grow up and do,” said Jacquette Boykin, a 6th grade English/language arts teacher at the school.
They can’t put their eyes on Kennedy or Washington.
They’re pictures in a book.
But they can see Barack Obama.”And what the students see matters, said Cozy Marks III, who was the president of Normandy’s school board when the district chose the Obama name.Media specialist Gwendolyn Shipps leads a reading and writing class at Barack Obama Elementary School in Normandy, Mo.
While the school and its famous name have brought pride and optimism to the impoverished community, the school struggles to raise achievement and hold onto educators.Sid Hastings for Education Week“It’s not just the name change.
It’s where it was, it’s how it looks,” Marks said.
We didn’t build it in the middle of the best neighborhood, we built it where there were derelict houses, where the need is greatest.”Boykin still remembers the excitement surrounding the school’s opening in 2011.
Local politicians lined up to christen the new, $11 million building, a beacon of hope in a blighted neighborhood.
Desperate to enroll their children in the school, some parents tried using fake addresses.“The kids’ demeanor was different, the parents’ demeanor was different,” said Boykin, who has worked in the district for 16 years.In the five years since, Boykin has witnessed some of that early enthusiasm fade.“Yeah, but our school is very transient,” she said.
You still feel proud saying ‘I work at Barack Obama Elementary.’ ”The sense of hope and optimism that the new school and its aspirational name brought to the Normandy community remains.
But the harsh realities that are present in so many high-poverty, segregated schools endure.Teachers and staff members have shuttled in and out.
The school has already had two principals.
Students come to school consistently, but their performance on tests hasn’t changed much.Not all schools bearing the Obama name are struggling under the strains of poverty and segregation.At theBarack Obama Male Leadership Academyin Dallas, high expectations have sparked high achievement.
Two graduating classes in, alumni at the all-boys magnet in the Oak Cliff neighborhood have collectively earned millions of dollars in college scholarships.Pittsburgh’sBarack Obama Academy of International Studiesis a high-poverty school that offers International Baccalaureate courses to students.
A new technology-themed magnet elementary school—namedBarack H. Obama Elementary Magnet School of Technology—opened just this month in Dekalb County, Ga., a district in suburban Atlanta.Still, other schools named for Obama have struggled with high suspension rates, chronic absenteeism, and access to high-quality courses.“Changing names can be important symbolic moves, but they don’t do anything to change the structural inequalities and racial inequalities facing schools and school systems around the country,” saidJanelle Scott, an education professor at the University of California, Berkeley.Avoiding Political NamesMore schools have already been named for Obama than any president since Ronald Reagan.But a majority of districts nationwide do not have a single school named after a commander-in-chief, a Manhattan Institute for Policy Researchstudy foundin 2007.
Instead, school-naming committees have embraced names unburdened by politics—some of the more popular monikers are inspired by nature or geography.Naming schools for public figures is one way to ensure public spaces reflect the nation’s diversity.
When the name of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. or labor organizer Cesar Chavez is attached to a school or street, the push often comes from the black or Hispanic community.
A different demographic—often white Southerners—makes its voice heard when communities fight back against efforts to rename schools that honor Confederate generals or slave owners, said Alderman, of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.Alderman hasstudied schools named for King.
Like the Obama schools, they are mostly in central cities, serving primarily low-income black and Hispanic students.
His research into the King-named schools delved into a late 1990s debate in the district in Riverside, Calif., where parents protested the school board’s decision to name a new high school for the slain civil rights leader.
The parents, Alderman said, feared that the school, where two-thirds of the students were white, would be perceived as a “black” school, harming their children’s chances of getting into top colleges.“A lot of people in the 1990s used the term ‘cultural wars’ to typify this struggle to claim American identity, the American past, and assert one’s vision of what we should be remembering about America,” Alderman said.
Maybe the term is no longer fashionable, but the struggle itself has not gone away.”For Scott, the University of California, Berkeley professor, debates over school names are a realistic portrayal of the struggles over race and education—ones that will continue long after Obama leaves office.“For far too many years, children went to school and continue to go to schools named after figures who would’ve been hostile to them,” she said.
We’re at a very interesting historical moment where people are attempting to face history.”Metropolitan St. Louis has been at the epicenter of many of these conversations.
A white police officer shot and killed unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown in August 2014, eight days after his graduation from Normandy High School.
His death ignited weeks of protests in neighboring Ferguson.Thousands of students in Normandy and similar districts around St. Louis are in the middle of a tug-of-war between state leaders and courts over a law that allows families to transfer out of failing schools.“When you come into St. Louis, you see the disparities, the stark disparities around housing and income and education,” saidJerome Morris, a professor of urban education at the University of Missouri, St. Louis.In his farewell address to the nation last week, Obama said that hopes that his presidency would usher in a post-racial America were “never realistic.” That is certainly evident in America’s public schools.More than 60 years after the Supreme Court’s historicBrownv.Board of Educationdecision, the nation’s public schools are re-segregating at a rapid pace.
A U.S. Government Accountability Office report released in May found that the percentage of public schools in high-poverty and the percentage comprised of mostly black or Hispanic students have more than doubled since 2000.
The percentage of all schools in which 75 percent or more of students are of the same racial or socio-economic class grew from 9 percent to 16 percent, roughly one in every six schools.Nearly all the Obama schools fall into that category.In a May 2014commencement speechin Topeka, Kan., the birthplace ofBrown, Michelle Obama said segregation is exacerbated by the fact that many schools serving mostly black and Hispanic communities don’t have equal resources.Those are the places that Marks, the former Normandy school board president, expects to see more schools embracing the Obama name.“In any place you need hope, where everything is not going in the direction you want it to go,” he said, “I would expect to see that name.”Corey MitchellAssociate Editor,Education WeekCorey Mitchell was an associate editor who covered special education, English-language learners and other special populations.Alex HarwinFollowUnfollowResearch Analyst,EdWeek Research CenterAlex Harwin is a quantitative research analyst for the EdWeek Research Center.emaillinkedinRelated Tags:High SchoolStudents of ColorDesegregationSchool Facilities & DesignDistrict LeadershipBarack ObamaElementary SchoolLibrary Intern Teresa Lewandowski contributed to this report.A version of this article appeared in theJanuary 18, 2017edition ofEducation WeekasSchools Named for the Obamas Mirror Race, Class DividesRelatedOpen image captionClose image captionU.S.

Many of the new school name options represent influential African-American Civil Rights leaders including Barbara Johns, Oliver Hill, and Henry Marsh.The top three finalist names on Monday night were Barack Obama, Northside, and Wishtree.Barack Obama became the country's first African-American president after he was elected in 2008.Stuart Elementary is the only school in the City of Richmond named after a Confederate general.
Richmond served as the Capital of the Confederacy during the Civil War.Earlier this year, the City of Petersburg voted to rename three Confederate-named schools.Effective July 1, 2018, A.P.
Hill will be renamed Cool Spring Elementary; Robert E. Lee will be renamed Lakemont Elementary; and J.E.B.
Stuart will be renamed Pleasants Lane Elementary.This is not the first school to be named after Obama, but it appears to be the first school renamed from a Confederate general to the 44th President.#BREAKING#RPSBoardvotes to rename JEB Stuart Elementary as@BarackObamaElementary School - students helped choose out of 7 finalists.

The new school will be known as the Barack H. Obama Elementary Magnet School of Technology.
This is the first public school in Georgia named for the nation’s 44th chief executive.The new school will be temporarily located in the former Terry Mill Elementary School, located at 797 Fayetteville Road, Atlanta, pending completion of a new replacement school on the former Clifton Elementary School site at 3132 Clifton Church Road, Decatur.Total costs for the new school will be $23 million.Barack H. Obama Elementary Magnet School of Technology, a modern 900-student facility similar to new schools at Fernbank Elementary School and Peachcrest Elementary School, is scheduled to open in January 2017.
Projected enrollment for school year 2017 is 715 students.“President Obama embodies the values of a strong family, hard work, and education as the means of getting ahead,” said Superintendent Dr. R. Stephen Green.
These values are reflected in the DeKalb County School District and are the keys to college and career readiness.”“President Obama’s public career and his family commitment offer inspiration to our students and staff,” said Dr. Melvin Johnson, chair of the DeKalb County Board of Education.
The name on this school will remind us every day of the importance of these attributes in being good citizens.”Board Member Dr. Michael Erwin, who represents the area, and Dr. Ralph Simpson, Regional Superintendent, co-chaired the school naming committee.
The naming committee also included two area principals, staff, parents, students, and representatives of the local faith community.
The committee identified naming options that were then voted on by students and staff at the school.“President Obama’s commitment to education demonstrates an understanding of the roles of parents, teachers, and students,” said Dr. Erwin.
He knows the most dedicated teachers and most supportive parents can make a difference if students show up, pay attention, and apply themselves to the fullest extent possible.”About the AuthorMaureen DowneyMaureen Downey has written editorials and opinion pieces about local, state and federal education policy since the 1990s.Editors' PicksCredit: DeKalb County School DistrictDeKalb superintendent finalist a polarizing figure in current district5h agoCredit: AP3 hurt in floor collapse in Savannah's 1899 US courthouse2h agoCredit: Ben GrayAtlanta Democrats shocked by loss of convention they were sure they won4h agoCredit: HandoutAmore e Amore combines traditional Italian cuisine with a festive vibe9h agoCredit: HandoutAmore e Amore combines traditional Italian cuisine with a festive vibe9h agoCredit: TNSAtlanta loses bid for Democratic National Convention to Chicago11h agoThe LatestCredit: City Schools of DecaturDecatur school board unanimously approves new superintendent1h agoPrincipal: Gwinnett students face discipline for hitting peer with belt4h agoDeKalb superintendent finalist a polarizing figure in current district5h agoFeaturedCredit: Ben GrayAtlanta Democrats shocked by loss of convention they were sure they won4h agoMeet the Atlanta grannies, volunteers for Grannies Respond /  Abuelas Responden15h agoFulton sales tax could fund hospitalAJC - Logo - Main©2023The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.All Rights Reserved.By using this website, you accept the terms of ourTerms of Use,Privacy Policy,CCPA, and understand your options regardingAd Choices.Learn aboutCareers at Cox Enterprises.AboutHelp CenterAbout the Atlanta Journal-ConstitutionNewsroom Ethics CodeCareersArchivePress OnDonateContact UsContact UsSend a News TipAdvertiseAJC NewsroomOur ProductsePaperNewslettersAll AJC PodcastsAJC LiveDownload iOS AppDownload Android AppSubscriptionPrint SubscriptionDigital SubscriptionManage SubscriptionYour ProfileNIE/Newspapers in Education©2023The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.All Rights Reserved.By using this website, you accept the terms of ourTerms of Use,Privacy Policy,CCPA, and understand your options regardingAd Choices.Learn aboutCareers at Cox Enterprises.Back to Top

The home of spry retirees and a respite for desert-weary Coachella attendees in the spring, Palm Springs has welcomed the former president many times during his two terms.
For their first vacation as civilians in eight years, they’ll reportedly stay at the home ofJames Costos, outgoing U.S. ambassador to Spain, and his husband, interior designer Michael Smith—who was the White House decorator during Obama’s two terms—for the fifth time (perTMZ).
Martha’s Vineyard and Hawaii were the family’s other major vacation hot spots over the years, though they dabbled in trips to Maine, Aspen, Florida, New York, and other locales, depending on diplomatic needs.

Obama has also gone kite-surfing with billionaire Richard Branson,spoken with young leadersin Chicago and paid a visit to his home state of Hawaii.The vacations have not gone unnoticed, in part because Obama is in an unusual position.
After leaving the White House, former President George W. Bushreturned to Texasand mostly avoided the limelight, following inhis father’s footsteps.
Former President Bill Clintonmoved to the sideas Hillary Clinton’s Senate career became the family’s focus.But Obama, who left the White House with a59% approval rating,retains something of a celebrity status that has brought media attention to their vacations.
As the Obamas settle into theirWashington D.C. home, here’s a definitive list of where they have traveled around the globe.The Obama staff declined to comment on President Obama’s vacation spots.Jan.

13, 2018  1:45 pm ESTUS Presidents’ Favorite Vacation Spotsistockphoto.comWeary taxpayers in need of a vacation can take some inspiration from U.S. presidents past and present by traveling to some of the same destinations as past commanders-in-chief.
While you can't book a stay at John F. Kennedy's favorite spot — the Kennedy Compound in Cape Cod, Massachusetts — you can dine likethe Clintons, who often frequented Martha's Vineyard during their presidential years.
As leaders of the country, many of the presidents knew which destinations within their nationwere the best for a weekend getawayIt's easy to dine like a U.S. president while on the road, as the presidential press corps has well documented thefood cravings of former presidents.
Bill Clinton was often seen atMcDonald's, and during his time in office, Barack Obama had been known to drop intoFive Guys, where he insisted on ordering his hamburger himself.
But to truly feel presidential, we suggest an escape to one of their favored spots across the country.When the president plans a weekend away, it can involve as many as 200 hotel rooms, two jumbo 747s, two passenger jets, five helicopters, 35 motorcade vehicles, charter flights for the press, and a cast of hundreds of people involved in the preparation.
To cut down on the number of hotel stays, many presidents have taken up second homes, including George W. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, Ronald Reagan's Rancho del Cielo in Santa Barbara, California, and Richard Nixon's now-demolished home in Key Biscayne, Florida.
We recognize that the average citizen may not be able to afford doing so, however, so we suggest youget a little savvy with your hotel room savingsso that you can unwind and dine like the Head of State at these 12 presidential hot spots.Travel EditorSyjil AshrafandLauren Mackcontributed to this article.Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Warm Springs, Ga.Jim Clark/Wikimedia CommonsFDR liked to soak in the warm springs in aptly named Warm Springs,Georgia.

Visitors can no longer soak in the springs, but they can still visit the area, which has a touch pool.
FDR's six-room home, nicknamed the Little White House, is open for visitors who can view the kitchen, living room, and bedrooms just as they were left on the day Roosevelt died of a stroke while sitting for a portrait.Harry S. Truman: Key West, Fla.Deror avi/Wikimedia CommonsState, but former President Harry Truman also enjoyed his time inone-of-a-kind Key West.
When in the "Conch Republic," Truman stayed at what was often called the "Little White House."
His chief cook, J. Sevilla of theU.S.S.

Dubbed the "Winter White House," it was reportedly where plans for Watergate were discussed and where the president secluded himself once the scandal broke.
Although the home was razed in February 2009 to make way for a new house, during Nixon's time, the U.S. government spent $625,000 to fix up the original, including putting in a new ice-maker because Nixon reportedly did not like ice with holes in it.Gerald Ford: Vail, Colo.istockphoto.comVail, whichtoday has an exploding restaurant scene, was a favorite spot for the Fords, so much so that parts of the town are named for the former president and first lady, including the Gerald R. Ford Amphitheater, an outdoor performance space perfect for a picnic, and theBetty Ford Alpine Gardens.Jimmy Carter: Plains, Ga.Bubba73/Wikimedia CommonsJimmy Carter took only 79 days off for vacation during his four-year term, the least of any president.

His parents had once owned the farm and when Carter was a boy, he sold produce from the farm from a wagon he hauled into town.Ronald Reagan: Santa Barbara, Calif.istockphoto.comReagan spent 436 days away from the White House during his turn as president, and he often retreated to Rancho del Cielo, his 688-acre ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains in California.
While there, he rarely left his ranch, which he used both as a vacation home and a diplomatic retreat where he welcomed world leaders like former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife Raisa, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, andQueen Elizabeth IIfor lunches and dinners.
The ranch included a grazing pasture for horses and deer.George H. W. Bush: Kennebunkport, Maineistockphoto.comThe Bushes enjoyed many rounds of golf, walks on the beach, and fishing in the Atlantic in Kennebunkport, Maine.

Bush: Crawford, TexasFlickr/The Bush Center/CC BY 2.0ThisTexastown with only one stoplight was the favorite retreat for former President George W. Bush, who spent many weeks on his Prairie Chapel Ranch in Crawford.
While he enjoyed eating out at local restaurants, his aides always had a stash of his favorite snack, Tex-Mex Chex, by his side.
Bush's aides have even joked that there were always two things within 10 feet of the president at all times: the nuclear football and a bag of Tex-Mex Chex.
Former White House chef Walter Scheib prepared the snack of Chex cereal with hot sauce, pretzels, pistachios, and Mexican pumpkin seeds.Barack Obama: Kailua, Hawaiiistockphoto.comWhile in office,President Barack Obamaoften took his family back to his birthplace ofHawaiifor family vacations, where they had a vacation home in Kailua.

Built by Post Cereals heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post in 1927, the property was willed by her to the United States government as a Winter White House for the use of presidents and foreign dignitaries.
Subsequent presidents had no interest in it, however, and the property was given back to the Post Foundation.
When business mogul Donald Trump came on the scene and attempted to buy it, his offer was rejected until he bought the land next to Mar-a-Lago and made plans to build a home that would block its ocean view.
As this threatened the value of the property, the Post Foundation acquiesced.
Trump bought Mar-a-Lago in 1985, and when he took office in 2017, the property finally became the presidential vacation home that Marjorie Merriweather Post had intended it to be.
Today it is a members-only country club in addition to being Trump's private estate.
