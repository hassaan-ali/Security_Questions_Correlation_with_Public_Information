His story is the American story — values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in service to others.When Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, he became the first African American to hold the office.
The framers of the Constitution always hoped that our leadership would not be limited to Americans of wealth or family connections.
Subject to the prejudices of their time—many of them owned slaves—most would not have foreseen an African American president.
Obama’s father, Barack Sr., a Kenyan economist, met his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, when both were students in Hawaii, where Barack was born on August 4, 1961.
They later divorced, and Barack’s mother married a man from Indonesia, where he spent his early childhood.
Before fifth grade, he returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents and attend Punahou School on scholarship.In his memoirDreams from My Father(1995), Obama describes the complexities of discovering his identity in adolescence.
After two years at Occidental College in Los Angeles, he transferred to Columbia University, where he studied political science and international relations.
Following graduation in 1983, Obama worked in New York City, then became a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago, coordinating with churches to improve housing conditions and set up job-training programs in a community hit hard by steel mill closures.
In 1988, he went to Harvard Law School, where he attracted national attention as the first African American president of theHarvard Law Review.
Returning to Chicago, he joined a small law firm specializing in civil rights.In 1992, Obama married Michelle Robinson, a lawyer who had also excelled at Harvard Law.
Their daughters, Malia and Sasha, were born in 1998 and 2001, respectively.
Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, and then to the U.S. Senate in 2004.
At the Democratic National Convention that summer, he delivered a much acclaimed keynote address.
Some pundits instantly pronounced him a future president, but most did not expect it to happen for some time.
Nevertheless, in 2008 he was elected over Arizona Senator John McCain by 365 to 173 electoral votes.As an incoming president, Obama faced many challenges—an economic collapse, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the continuing menace of terrorism.
Inaugurated before an estimated crowd of 1.8 million people, Obama proposed unprecedented federal spending to revive the economy and also hoped to renew America’s stature in the world.
During his first term he signed three signature bills: an omnibus bill to stimulate the economy, legislation making health care more accessible and affordable, and legislation reforming the nation’s financial institutions.
Obama also pressed for a fair pay act for women, financial reform legislation, and efforts for consumer protection.
In 2009, Obama became the fourth president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.In 2012, he was reelected over former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney by 332 to 206 electoral votes.
The Middle East remained a key foreign policy challenge.
Obama had overseen the killing of Osama bin Laden, but a new self-proclaimed Islamic State arose during a civil war in Syria and began inciting terrorist attacks.
Obama sought to manage a hostile Iran with a treaty that hindered its development of nuclear weapons.
The Obama administration also adopted a climate change agreement signed by 195 nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming.In the last year of his second term, Obama spoke at two events that clearly moved him—the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery, and the dedication of the National Museum of African American History and Culture.
Our union is not yet perfect, but we are getting closer,” he said in Selma.
And that’s why we celebrate,” he told those attending the museum opening in Washington, “mindful that our work is not yet done.”Learn more about Barack Obama’s spouse,Michelle Obama.President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama pose with their daughters, Malia and SashaStay ConnectedSign UpEmail Address*RequiredZIP CodePlease leave blank.We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.ShareShare this page on FacebookShare this page on Twitterhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/barack-obama/?utm_source=linkHomeThe AdministrationExecutive OfficesPrioritiesThe RecordBriefing RoomThe White HouseDisclosuresGet InvolvedEspañolContact UsPrivacy PolicyCopyright PolicyAccessibility StatementInstagramOpens in a new windowFacebookOpens in a new windowTwitterOpens in a new windowYouTubeOpens in a new windowThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave NWWashington, DC 20500WH.govScroll to TopScroll to TopTop

PresidentsBarack ObamaBarack Obama: Life Before the PresidencyByConsulting Editor: Michael NelsonPhoto: University of ChicagoBarack Hussein Obama II was born on August 4, 1961, in Hawaii.
His parents, who met as students at the University of Hawaii, were Ann Dunham, a white American from Kansas, and Barack Obama Sr., a black Kenyan studying in the United States.
Obama's father left the family when Obama was two and, after further studies at Harvard University, returned to Kenya, where he died in an automobile accident nineteen years later.
After his parents divorced, Obama's mother married another foreign student at the University of Hawaii, Lolo Soetoro of Indonesia.
From age six through ten, Obama lived with his mother and stepfather in Indonesia, where he attended Catholic and Muslim schools.
I was raised as an Indonesian child and a Hawaiian child and as a black child and as a white child,” Obama later recalled.
And so what I benefited from is a multiplicity of cultures that all fed me.”Concerned for his education, Obama’s mother sent him back to Hawaii to live with her parents, Stanley and Madelyn Dunham, and to attend Hawaii’s prestigious Punahou School from fifth grade through graduation from high school.
While Obama was in school, his mother divorced Soetoro, returned to Hawaii to study cultural anthropology at the university, and then went back to Indonesia to do field research.
Living with his grandparents, Obama was a good but not outstanding student at Punahou.
He played varsity basketball and, as he later admitted, “dabbled in drugs and alcohol,” including marijuana and cocaine.
As for religion, Obama later wrote, because his parents and grandparents were nonbelievers, “I was not raised in a religious household.”Obama's mother, who “to the end of her life [in 1995] would proudly proclaim herself an unreconstructed liberal,” deeply admired the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and taught her son, he later wrote, that “To be black was to be the beneficiary of a great inheritance, a special destiny, glorious burdens that only we were strong enough to bear.” But, as culturally diverse as Hawaii was, its African American population was miniscule.
With no father or other family members to serve as role models (his relationship with his white grandfather was difficult), Obama later reflected, “I was trying to raise myself to be a black man in America, and beyond the given of my appearance, no one around me seemed to know exactly what that meant.”Obama left Hawaii for college, enrolling first at Occidental College in Los Angeles for his freshman and sophomore years, and then at Columbia University in New York City.
He read deeply and widely about political and international affairs, graduating from Columbia with a political science major in 1983.
A movie version of his Columbia years,Barry, was released in 2016.)
After spending an additional year in New York as a researcher with Business International Group, a global business consulting firm, Obama accepted an offer to work as a community organizer in Chicago's largely poor and black South Side.
As biographer David Mendell notes in his 2007 book,Obama: From Promise to Power, the job gave Obama “his first deep immersion into the African American community he had longed to both understand and belong to.”Obama's main assignment as an organizer was to launch the church-funded Developing Communities Project and, in particular, to organize residents of Altgeld Gardens to pressure Chicago's city hall to improve conditions in the poorly maintained public housing project.
His efforts met with some success, but he concluded that, faced with a complex city bureaucracy, “I just can't get things done here without a law degree.”In 1988, Obama enrolled at Harvard Law School, where he excelled as a student, graduating magna cum laude and winning election as president of the prestigious Harvard Law Review for the academic year 1990-1991.
Although Obama was a liberal, he won the election by persuading the journal’s outnumbered conservative staffers that he would treat their views fairly, which he is widely acknowledged to have done.
As the first African American president in the long history of the law review, Obama drew widespread media attention and a contract from Random House to write a book about race relations.
The book,Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance(1995), turned out to be mostly a personal memoir, focusing in particular on his struggle to come to terms with his identity as a black man raised by whites in the absence of his African father.During a summer internship at Chicago’s Sidley and Austin law firm after his first year at Harvard, Obama met Michelle Robinson, a South Side native and Princeton University and Harvard Law School graduate who supervised his work at the firm.
He wooed her ardently (as memorialized in another 2016 movie,Southside with You), and after a four-year courtship they married in 1992.
The Obamas settled in Chicago's racially integrated, middle-class Hyde Park neighborhood, where their first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998 and their second daughter, Natasha (called Sasha), was born in 2001.After directing Illinois Project Vote, a voter registration drive aimed at increasing black turnout in the 1992 election, Obama accepted positions as an attorney with the civil rights law firm of Miner, Barnhill and Galland and as a lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School.
He launched his first campaign for political office in 1996 after his district’s state senator, Alice Palmer, decided to run for Congress.
With Palmer’s support, Obama announced his candidacy to replace her in the Illinois legislature.
When Palmer's congressional campaign faltered, she decided to run for reelection instead.
But Obama refused to withdraw from the race, successfully challenged the validity of Palmer’s voter petitions, and was easily elected after her name was kept off the ballot.Obama’s time in the legislature initially was frustrating.
Republicans controlled the state senate, and many of his black Democratic colleagues resented the hardball tactics he had employed against Palmer.
But he adapted, developing cordial personal relations with legislators of both parties and cultivating Senate Democratic leader Emil Jones Jr., another African American senator from Chicago, as a mentor.
Obama was able to get campaign finance reform and crime legislation enacted even when his party was in the minority, and after 2002, when the Democrats won control of the Senate, he became a leading legislator on a wide range of issues, passing nearly 300 bills aimed at helping children, old people, labor unions, and the poor.Obama’s one serious misstep during his early political career (he later called it “an ill-considered race” in which he got “spanked” by the voters) was a 2000 Democratic primary challenge to US Representative Bobby Rush.
Rush was a former Illinois Black Panther leader who subsequently entered mainstream politics as a Chicago alderman and was elected to Congress from the South Side’s first congressional district in 1992.
Obama was not nearly as well known as the popular Rush, and the combination of his unusual upbringing and his association with predominantly white elite universities such as Columbia, Harvard, and Chicago aroused doubts about his authenticity as a black man among the district’s overwhelmingly African American voters.
Obama suffered what he labeled “a drubbing,” losing to Rush by a 30-percentage point margin.
Rush remained in the House; he was reelected to his thirteenth consecutive term in 2016.Returning to the state senate, Obama began eyeing a 2004 race for the US Senate seat held by Peter Fitzgerald, an unpopular first-term Republican who decided not to run for reelection.
In October 2002, as Congress was considering a resolution authorizing President George W. Bush to launch a war to depose the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, Obama spoke at an antiwar rally in Chicago.
I don't oppose all wars,” he declared.
What I am opposed to is a dumb war.
What I am opposed to is a rash war.” By speaking out against Bush’s war policies, Obama set himself apart from the other leading candidates for the Democratic Senate nomination, as well as from most Senate Democrats with presidential ambitions, including Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, John Kerry of Massachusetts, and John Edwards of North Carolina.
Obama’s initially unpopular antiwar stance eventually worked to his political advantage as the war became increasingly unpopular with the passage of time.Advised by political consultant David Axelrod, who had a strong record of helping black candidates succeed in majority-white constituencies, Obama assembled a coalition of African Americans and white liberals to win the Democratic Senate primary with 53 percent of the vote, more than all five of his opponents combined.
He then moved toward the political center to wage his general election campaign against Republican nominee Jack Ryan, an attractive candidate who, after making hundreds of millions of dollars as an investor, had left the business world to teach in an inner-city Chicago school.
But Ryan was forced to drop out of the race when scandalous details about his divorce were made public, and Obama coasted to an easy victory against Ryan’s replacement on the ballot, black conservative Republican Alan Keyes.
Obama won by the largest margin in the history of Senate elections in Illinois, 70 percent to 27 percent.In addition to his election, the other highlight of 2004 for Obama was his wildly successful keynote address at the Democratic National Convention.
There’s not a liberal America and a conservative America,” he declared.
There’s a United States of America.
There’s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America.
There’s a United States of America.” Obama encapsulated his speech’s themes of optimism and unity with the phrase, “the audacity of hope,” which he borrowed from Reverend Jeremiah Wright.
Wright was the pastor of Chicago’s Trinity United Church of Christ, a large and influential black congregation where Obama was baptized when he became a Christian in 1988.
Obama also used the phrase as the title of his second book,The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream(2006), which became a national bestseller in the wake of his newfound national popularity.
Describing his religious conversion, Obama wrote, “I felt God’s spirit beckoning me.
I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth.”Consulting Editor: Michael NelsonProfessor of Political ScienceRhodes CollegeBarack Obama's educationPunahou School, HawaiiOccidental College, Los AngelesColumbia University, New York CityHarvard Law School, BostonMore ResourcesBarack Obama Presidency PageBarack Obama EssaysLife in BriefLife Before the Presidency (Current Essay)Campaigns & ElectionsDomestic AffairsForeign AffairsFamily LifeImpact and LegacyUniversity of VirginiaMiller CenterMain navigationThe PresidencyIssues & PolicyExpertsEventsDonateUVA Democracy BiennialFooterAboutContact UsMiller Center Governing CouncilMiller Center FoundationPrivacy PolicyNotice of Non-Discrimination and Equal OpportunityDownload millercenter.org DataHelp inform the discussionSupport the Miller CenterFacebookTwitterYouTubeSubscribe© Copyright 2023.

2]PresidentBarack Obamaand his family were given the malePortuguese Water Dogas a gift after months of speculation about thebreedand identity of their future pet.
2][8]The final choice was made in part because elder daughterMalia's allergies dictated a need for ahypoallergenicbreed.
Bo was occasionally called "First Dog".
1][2][3]In August 2013, Bo was joined bySunny, a female dog of the same breed.
9]Bo was named by sisters Malia and Sasha after their cousins' cat, First LadyMichelle Obama's father, and as a reference to the R&B musicianBo Diddley.
Bo's name was also Barack Obama's initials.Breed background[edit]Main article:Portuguese Water DogThe Portuguese Water Dog is originally from the Algarve region of Portugal.
Only 48 Portuguese Water Dogs were entered for Britain'sCruftscompetition in the year 2009[10]and the author ofThe New Complete Portuguese Water Dog, Kitty Braund, believes there are about 50,000 in North America.
11]Due to its fleecy coat of minimally shedding hair,[12]the Portuguese Water Dog is considered ahypoallergenic dog breed.
13]Breeding and original owners[edit]The Obamas with BoBred by Martha and Art Stern of Amigo Portuguese Water Dogs in Boyd, Texas,[7]Bo was a son of Watson—of the Rader family in Pittsburgh's Ambridge suburb—and Penny, belonging to Art and Martha Stern.
One of Bo's nine litter mates was SenatorTed Kennedy's dog named Cappy (Amigo's Captain Courageous); the litter was named "Hope and Change", in honor of Obama'svictory.
14][15]Bo's original buyer is unknown, but eventually they returned him to the Stern family; purchasing Bo required signing a contract to return him to his breeder if things did not work out.
Bo enrolled with Kennedy'sobedience trainerDawn Sylvia-Stasiewiczin Hume, Virginia on January 5, 2009.
16]Selection of the dog[edit]At his first press conference asPresident-elect, Obama was questioned by reporters as to which breed the family was looking to acquire; he replied, "We have two criteria that have to be reconciled.
One is that Malia is allergic, so it has to be hypoallergenic.
There are a number of breeds that are hypoallergenic.
On the other hand, our preference would be to get a shelter dog, but, obviously, a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me.
So—so whether we're going to be able to balance those two things, I think, is a pressing issue on the Obama household.
17]George Stephanopoulosasked Obama on television in early January what kind of dog they would get, and when, saying that he was passing on a question from Obama's daughters who were sitting in the control room.
Obama said "They seem to have narrowed it down to alabradoodleor aPortuguese water hound... medium-sized dog, and so, we're now going to start looking atsheltersto see when one of those dogs might come up.
18]Much was made by the public and press about the family's search for a dog.
On April 12, 2009, it was announced that the Obamas would soon accept a six-month-old Portuguese Water Dog puppy as a gift from Senator Kennedy.
The dog was reported to have visited the family some weeks earlier[19]in a secret meeting to gauge compatibility and purportedly referred to by staffers as "The Meeting".
However, the gift was not accepted until the dog officially arrived and moved in at theWhite Houseon Tuesday, April 14, 2009.
20]Immediately after he arrived, the family staged aphoto opwith Bo on the property'sSouth Lawn.
21]At the conference, Obama was asked if he would allow Bo inside theOval Office, to which he responded: "of course.
21]He also gave a nod to PresidentHarry Truman's quote "If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.
21]The White House website was later updated to include official pictures and biographical details of Bo.
2]Biographical details[edit]Bo wearing aleiupon his White House arrivalListed by the name "Amigo's New Hope" withAmerican Kennel Club's breed registry[22]and given the name "Charlie" by his original owners,[23]the puppy received his name from President Obama's two daughters,Malia and Sasha, in part after their cousins' cat andMichelle Obama'sfather's nickname Diddley; the dog is a namesake of singerBo Diddley.
24][25]In June 2009, the White House released a baseball card for Bo with his new official portrait on one side and tongue-in-cheek statistics on the other; information included the facts that Bo's favorite food is tomatoes and that he does not yet know how to swim.
The card was available by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the White House.
26][27][28]According to financial disclosure forms released by President Obama in 2010, Bo was purchased for $1,600 (equivalent to $1,990 in 2021).
29]As of August 2012, Bo was on a diet, though no other details were released (it was announced by the President during the Kids' State Dinner, where children from the states and territories who had won a contest to design healthy, appealing meals had lunch at the White House).
30]Bo's heritage[edit]The Obamas walking with BoThe Obamas had voiced a strong desire to adopt ashelter dog, but made no firm commitments.
31]In Summer 2008,Best Friends Animal Society, an animal welfare organization, gathered 50,000 signatures on a petition asking the family to adopt a shelter animal.
32]Bo was a gift through a breeder, not a shelter dog.
Dog expertCésar Millánstated Bo could be considered part of a larger group known as "rescue dogs".
He was unsuccessful in his first home when plans for him to provide companionship to an older female dog went awry; apparently his attempts tosuckleirritated her.
20][33]The Obamas pledged a donation to the DC Humane Society in a show of support for shelter dogs.
34]TheHumane Society of the United Statesreleased a statement thanking the Obamas "for taking in a second-chance dog," but discouraged employing breeders.
35]Reactions in the media[edit]Bo and Obama running through the east wing of theWhite HouseBo in March 2010The Washington Post's Manuel Roig-Franzia, granted exclusive access to Bo for his debut in print, described the puppy: "Bo's a handsome little guy.
Well suited for formal occasions at theWhite House, he's got tuxedo-black fur, with a white chest, white paws and a rakish white goatee.
36]People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals(PETA) described the family's choice to accept the gift of a puppy from a family friend as "disquieting" and publicly urged Obama to have Bo neutered, despite the dog having been neutered before the Obamas received him.
37][38]In anticipation of increased interest in the breed, the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America issued a statement requesting that members of the public considering obtaining the dogs "ensure that this breed fits their lifestyle", advising that the dogs' needs preclude their being left alone for long periods or boarded in kennels.
39]Immediately upon Bo joining the First Family, four children's books and aplush toydepicting him were slated for publication or manufacture.
40][41][42]On July 17, 2009,Ben Greenman, writing inThe New York Timesas Bo, reflected on his first hundred days in office.
43]In the final episode of theHistory Channel'sLife After People, aired March 16, 2010, the producers imagined what life would be like for Bo after the disappearance of humanity.
44]This program speculated that he would leave the White House, and live off seafood from the Chesapeake Bay.
45]Bo was also shown onDogs 101, as part of segment about the breed.
46][47]Bo appeared in the comic bookLockjaw and the Pet Avengersand on the television showsLate Night with Seth MeyersandEllen.
On Meyers' show, Bo was the subject of a "Barney Cam" parody in which he is shown to be shamelessly manipulating White House staffers and guests (such as by finding and planting classified information in the bag of a speechwriter who refused to give him treats).
48]Bo acquired the nickname "Bobama".

The former president posted about the family dogon Instagram, mourning the loss of his twelve year old pet.
Today our family lost a true friend and loyal companion," Barack Obama wrote in the caption.
For more than a decade, Bo was a constant, gentle presence in our lives—happy to see us on our good days, our bad days, and everyday in between.
He tolerated all the fuss that came with being in the White House, had a big bark but no bite, loved to jump in the pool in the summer, was unflappable with children, lived for scraps around the dinner table, and had great hair.
He was exactly what we needed and more than we ever expected.
We will miss him dearly.
View full post on InstagramPresident Obama had an extremely close relationship with Bo.
The former president and his wife, Michelle Obama, promised their daughters, Malia and Sasha, a puppy once they got to the White House.
After much speculation surrounding the dog breed and name, the first family settled on Bo, a Portuguese water dog and a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy and his wife, Vicki.
As Obama states in his memoir,A Promised Land, Bo was part of a litter related to Kennedy's own pair of Portuguese water dogs.Obama enjoyed his private moments with Bo during his presidency.
Here, the pair played football on the White House South Lawn.The White House//Getty ImagesCrown A Promised LandCrown A Promised LandNow 64% Off$16 at AmazonIn his memoir, Obama affectionately described his bond with Bo, who became his loyal friend and a link to normalcy throughout his presidency.
With Bo, I got what someone once described as the only reliable friend a politician can have in Washington.
He also gave me an added excuse to put off my evening paperwork and join my family on meandering after-dinner walks around the South Lawn," Obama noted.
It was during those moments—with the light fading into streaks of purple and gold, Michelle smiling and squeezing my hand as Bo bounded in and out of the bushes with the girls giving chase—that I felt normal and whole and as lucky as any man has a right to expect.
President Barack Obama and his daughters, Malia and Sasha, pictured the day their dog, Bo, arrived at the White House.Chip Somodevilla//Getty ImagesEven beyond Obama's love for Bo, he served as a reminder of both Ted Kennedy, who passed away from a brain tumor, and the president's commitment to affordable health care.
Obama remembers calling to thank Kennedy for the dog, but he could only speak with his wife, as Kennedy's health rapidly declined.
Throughout his life, and especially during Obama's first term, Kennedy became instrumental in the fight for universal health care.
Obama recalled his advice on the subject, just before the Affordable Care Act passed.
I would think of Teddy sometimes when Bo wandered into the Treaty Room and curled up at my feet," Obama writes.
And I’d recall what Teddy had told me that day, just before we walked into the East Room together.
This is the time, Mr. President,' he had said.
Don’t let it slip away.
President Obama was photographed petting his dog, Bo, outside the Oval Office.Pool//Getty ImagesBarack Obama was not the only member of the family to develop such a close bond with Bo.
On Instagram, former First Lady Michelle Obamashared her own memoriesof the cherished pet, in both a series of photos and a heartfelt note from the whole Obama family, including the Obama's other dog, Sunny.
Read her full tribute below:This afternoon was a difficult one for our family.
We said goodbye to our best friend—our dog, Bo—after a battle with cancer.
On the campaign trail in 2008, we promised our daughters that we would get a puppy after the election.
At the time, Bo was supposed to be a companion for the girls.
We had no idea how much he would mean to all of us.For more than a decade, Bo was a constant, comforting presence in our lives.
He was there when the girls came home from school, greeting them with a wag.
He was there when Barack and I needed a break, sauntering into one of our offices like he owned the place, a ball clamped firmly in his teeth.
He was there when we flew on Air Force One, when tens of thousands flocked to the South Lawn for the Easter Egg Roll, and when the Pope came to visit.
And when our lives slowed down, he was there, too—helping us see the girls off to college and adjust to life as empty nesters.This past year, with everyone back home during the pandemic, no one was happier than Bo.
All his people were under one roof again—just like the day we got him.
I will always be grateful that Bo and the girls got to spend so much time together at the end.As a family, we will miss Bo dearly.
But we are thankful that he lived such a joyful life full of snuggles, games of fetch, and evenings spent lying on the couch.We also know we weren’t the only ones who cared for Bo, and are grateful for all the love you showed him over the years.
Please hug the furry members of your family a little closer tonight—and give them a belly rub from us.—Michelle, Barack, Malia, Sasha, and SunnyView full post on InstagramAnnie GoldsmithNews WriterAnnie Goldsmith is the news writer for Town & Country, where she covers culture, politics, style, and the British royal family.PoliticsPresident Joe Biden Called Ethel KennedyA History of the White House Easter Egg RollUNESCO Reaffirms Support for Rebuilding UkraineDonald Trump Arraigned in ManhattanAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowPope Francis Returns Vatican Parthenon SculpturesMeet Naomi Biden's Husband Peter NealWhat Happens if Trump is Indicted?

Edward M. Kennedy, who owns several Portuguese water dogs himself.
We couldn't be happier to see the joy that Bo is bringing to Malia and Sasha," Kennedy said in a statement.
We love our Portuguese water dogs and know that the girls - and their parents - will love theirs, too.
The Washington Post reported in its online editions Saturday night that Mr. Obama's daughters chose the name Bo for the pup because first lady Michelle Obama's father was nicknamed Diddley.
The name for the dog was an apparent reference to the singer "Bo" Diddley.White House aides told the AP that the office of the first lady arranged an exclusive deal on the dog story with the Post.
The officials, who demanded anonymity because of the deal with the Post on exclusive details, said the dog was not in the White House as of Saturday evening.Throughout the day Saturday, celebrity Web sites and bloggers were abuzz with rumors of the first family's selection of a Portuguese water dog; one site even claimed it had pictures of the future first pet.The president had embraced the frenzy: "Oh, man, now, that's top secret," President Obama joked Friday to reporters.Mr.
Obama promised his daughters a puppy during the presidential campaign.
This is Washington.
That was a campaign promise," Mr. Obama said when he appeared on Jay Leno's television talk show last month, as the audience roared with laughter.
No, I'm teasing.
The dog will be there shortly.
The president and first lady had said their choice was down to either a Portuguese water dog or a Labradoodle because they were considered good pets for children who have allergies, as Malia does.By Associated Press Writer Philip ElliottTrending NewsTruck crashes carrying 40,000 pounds of toxic soil from East PalestineMelania Trump makes first statement since husband's indictmentAfghanistan military working dog and Army handler reunited in U.S."Unprecedented" sea level rise observed along U.S. coastsPlane passenger arrested, charged after Alaska Airlines flight makes diversionFirst published on April 12, 2009 / 10:51 AM© 2009 The Associated Press.

That email doesn't look right.By adding your email you agree to get updates about Spoon University HealthierWith a lot of talk about Obama leaving office and Trump coming in, there has been tension among political parties.
In an attempt to lighten the overall "mood" of the situation and being the curious foodie I am, I've investigated what Obama and his family ate in their time at the White House.
I found out that the Obama family sure didn't skimp on good eats (both healthy and not-so-healthy) in their eight years in Washington.Chips and GuacWhether it be in front of the TV of behind the desk in the Oval Office, this family likes to snack ondelicious Mexican snackslike nachos andhomemade guacamole.HoneyWhen you have your own residential White House bee keeper tending to bees and dishing out fresh honey every day, it's hard not to have it with every meal.
Honey is natural and healthy, and can actuallyhelp you combat seasonal allergies.Fresh VeggiesYou may very well be aware about Michelle Obama's prized garden.
She encourages not just kids and families across America to eat healthy and eat local vegetables, but her own family as well.Her and Barack changed American Food Policy forever,by encouraging healthier eating and banning a lot of bad chemicals and fats.Chili Half-SmokeBarack's favorite #cheatdayeats can be found atBen's Chili Bowlin Washington D.C.
It's in fact so well-known that he frequents there that it's become almost a monument in the city, with a wall mural of Barack himself.
Putting a healthy spin on chili, the Obama's have a great homemadeTurkey Chili recipe to make at home.Chocolate Covered Macadamia NutsThere are always raw nuts around for Obama to keep his energy levels high, but sometimes a little twist on the common healthy snack is necessary.
A common treat in Hawaii, Obama likes to get back to his roots with thissweet snack.
They were a staple around the White House, and could be found in bowls in a number of the rooms.ApplesFor times where Obama wants to be a little healthier than chocolate covered nuts, he keeps abowl of applesin the center of the Oval Office for himself and guests to enjoy.
He definitely knows thereasons we should all be eating more apples.BurgersOne ofObama's favorite burger jointsisRay's Hell Burger,in Arlington, VA.
He's even brought esteemed foreign guests with him to join in on the deliciousness.
Simple, down-home places seem to be a guilty pleasure for Barack.PizzaAside from Chili, this is Obama's favorite food.
It may seem basic, but hey, there is nothing like agood pizza.
Pi Pizzeria is his go-to, where they serve up deep dish, gourmet, mouthwatering pies.
If this is making your stomach growl, don't forget you don't need to go out to get the good stuff.
You can makepizza yourself at homein a pinch.SalmonWhen the family needs a break from all of the the Chili, Burgers, and Pizza, a healthy meal they like to have at dinner isSalmon and Broccoli.The Obama's are all about healthy food and locally grown products.
While they do indulge like the rest of us, it's humbling to know that you're probably having the same thing for snacks and dinner at your house as the first family.facebooktwitterpinterestSharesNostalgicAdventurousAdultingLunchDinnerBreakfastSnackPop CultureNewsBucket ListAmy CormanUnion CollegeApril 28th, 2017Get more Spoon in your feed.twitteryoutubetiktokfacebooksnapchatinstagramGetSpoon Universitydelivered to youJoinYou tryna be tricky?

I found out that the Obama family sure didn't skimp on good eats (both healthy and not-so-healthy) in their eight years in Washington.Chips and guacShutterstockWhether it be in front of the TV or behind the desk in the Oval Office, this family likes to snack ondelicious Mexican snackslike nachos andhomemade guacamole.HoneyShutterstockWhen you have your own residential White House bee keeper tending to bees and dishing out fresh honey every day, it's hard not to have it with every meal.

Barack Obama's Favorite Food Is Broccoli, But What Does He Like to Eat On Cheat Days?Skip to main contentAdvertisementShowbiz Cheat SheetExpand SearchCollapse SearchSearch for:SearchMenuEntertainmentExclusivesTVWhat to WatchCelebrityRoyal familyMusicMoviesFollowInstagramYoutubeFacebookTwitterAbout UsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyWeb AccessibilitySportscastingEndgame360MotorBiscuitEntertainmentExclusivesTVWhat to WatchCelebrityRoyal familyMusicMoviesSwipeHome/CelebrityBarack Obama’s Favorite Food Is Broccoli, But What Does He Like to Eat On Cheat Days?byPerry Carpentertwitter|More Articles: CelebrityPublished onApril 26, 2020Share:FormerPresident Barack Obama’sfavorite food is not what you might expect.
Despite having all kinds of options to pick from, Obama once revealed this his favorite food of all time is actuallybroccoli.
While we have no doubt that Obama loves to indulge in a steaming plate of the green veggie, we also know what he likes to eat on his cheat days.President Barack Obama | Pete Souza/The White House via Getty ImagesBarack Obama’s favorite food is broccoliObama enjoys a good burger like the rest of us, but when it comes to hisfavorite food, broccoli is at the top of his list.Back in 2013, Obama was asked about his favorite type of food during a White House engagement geared toward children.
According to theTelegraph, Obama revealed that broccoli is his favorite food, though he did not reveal how he likes it cooked.Barack Obama’s favorite food is the exact opposite of former
President George H.W.
Bush, who once said that he cannot stand the taste of
broccoli.
In the 1990s, Bush revealed that he has not eaten the veggie since he
was a child and doesn’t think he’ll ever touch it again.“And I haven’t liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it.
And I’m President of the United States, and I’m not going to eat any more broccoli!” he stated.For Obama’s part, he picked broccoli in part to highlight the importance of healthy eating.
He was asked about the staple during an event that encouraged children toeat more vegetables, setting them up for healthier eating habits at a young age.“Food can be fun.
It can be healthy,” Obama said at the
time.
You are setting up habits that are going to be great your entire
life.”President Obama loves this treat on cheat dayBroccoli aside, there are times whenBarack Obamaindulges and eats his what might be his second favorite meal of all-time.
And that dish is featured at a Washington D.C. restaurant called Ben’s Chili Bowl.According toPittsburgh
Post-Gazette, prior to his inauguration, Obama stopped by the local
eatery with Adrian Fenty, the mayor of D.C., and ordered a half-smoked
chili-dog, complete with cheese fries and a large sweet tea.“Ya’ll have some Pepto-Bismol?” Obama said in a clip of
the outing.After Barack Obama’s visit went viral, Ben’s Chili Bowl witnessed
an increase in customers.
Many of these newcomers were tourists wanting to grab
a bite to eat at the same place as Obama did.Obama, of course, is hardly the first celebrity to enjoy a meal at Ben’s Chili Bowl.
The long-time establishment has seen many celebrities come and go, with disgraced comedian Bill Cosby being one of their most frequent guests.
Ben’s even went so far as to paint over Cosby’s mural inside the restaurant with one ofPresident Obama.There is no telling what Obama’s favorite haunt is now that he is
out of Washington, but it’s probably safe to assume that he still stops by
Ben’s Chili Bowl whenever he is in town.Barack Obama’s other favorite foodsOne of Obama’s other secret cheat day meals is pizza.
According
toSpoon
University, pizza is one of Obama’s top choices, outside of chili,
of course.
In fact, the Obamas frequently ordered this Italian staple during
his time at the White House.It all started on the campaign trail in Missouri, when Barack
Obama asked a staffer to get some pizza, they went out and got their favorite —
Pi Pizzeria.
He Liked the St. Louis style deep dish pizza so much he said it
was the best he had ever had.
He even had the owners come to Washington D.C. to
make the pizza together.Other dishes the Obamas enjoyed during their two terms in office were chips and guac, honey, chocolate-covered macadamia nuts, burgers (his favorite being Ray’s Hell Burger), and salmon (which Barack Obama loved to pair withbroccoli).Obama and his family also gained a reputation for being healthy
eaters when he was president.
Michelle had a prized garden at the White House
while he constantly encouraged children to eat local veggies.The couple also did a lot to change American Food Policy and get people to start developing healthier eating habits.Barack Obamaand Michelle Obama did so by endorsing healthy foods and banning chemicals and fats in certain processed foods.Tags:Barack ObamaInstagramYoutubeFacebookTwitterAbout UsContact UsCareersEthicsFact checking commitmentCorrections commitmentOwnership funding advertising infoSportscastingEndgame360MotorBiscuit© Copyright 2023 Endgame360 Inc.

This Is What Barack Obama Eats×RECIPESNEWSEXCLUSIVESRESTAURANTSGROCERYHOW TOFACTSTIPSTVFEATURESAboutEditorial PoliciesPrivacy PolicyTerms of Use© 2023Static Media®.
All Rights ReservedThis Is What Barack Obama EatsRECIPESNEWSEXCLUSIVESRESTAURANTSGROCERYHOW TOFACTSTIPSTVFEATURESThis Is What Barack Obama EatsGetty ImagesByChris Heasman/Updated: Jan. 31, 2023  8:40 pm ESTIt's probably not an exaggeration to suggest that Barack Obama might have been the most physically fit President the United States of America has ever had.
That comes down to a few things, as it does with anybody — a decentworkout routinedoesn't hurt, for example, and we can't rule out good genes.
But a crucial part of his health is his diet; a topic which was approached with some curiosity by the media during his presidency.Now, we've looked at thecurrent President'sfood habits before, and let's just say that, well, they aren't great.
And while we'd never want to foster such divisions as to compare the two, it'll certainly be interesting to see how Obama stacks up.
All we'll say is this: expect more salads, more fruit and far, far fewer calories.
From the early breakfasts to the chili recipes to the Dijon mustard scandal that rocked the world, these are the eating habits of Barack Obama.Coffee is out of the questionShutterstockToday, upwards of83 percentof adults in the United States drink coffee, most of them during the morning.
Obama is not one of them.
Yes, despite a grueling daily routine (which, to be fair, is probably a little bit less grueling these days), according to personal aideReggie Love, Obama rarely drinks coffee in the morning.
Instead, he opts for healthier fare, which might include orange juice, green tea or simply water.
This iscombined witha daily, 45-minute strength or cardio workout.
Put them together and cut out the caffeine dependency and you've got yourself an ex-President who, at the age of 56, is healthier than most people are when they're 30.The few times he has drunk coffee, however, Obama has courted disaster.
In 2014, the world watched in horror as the then-President saluted two marine guardswhile holding a coffee cup— just the sort of devastating faux pas that will probably make Obama regret his decision to break his no-coffee rule until the end of time.Breakfast is a big deal, thoughShutterstockBreakfastis as big a deal to Obama as it is to the majority of wholesome Americans.
His most common choice of breakfast food tends to be eggs —four to six— potatoes and wheat toast.
Considering agood breakfast canreduce your chances of becoming obese, boosts your metabolism, lowers your cholesterol levels and has a positive effect on the brain, Obama's rigorous keeping to a healthy breakfast as part of his morning routine is probably a good idea.When he was President, Obama would usually include breakfast with that workout and be in the Oval Office, ready to work, by the mid-morning.
Now, however, things are a bit easier, and Obama hasopened up abouthow he's enjoyed the freedom of being able to control his mornings himself.
With this in mind, it's probably not a stretch to imagine that, nowadays, he probably indulges in a lie-in and a late breakfast every now and then.
Wouldn't you?Everything's healthy — mostlyGetty ImagesThe rule of thumb with Obama's diet is that, with a few notable exceptions (which we'll talk about later), he generally eats healthily.
Australia's ex-Foreign Minister, Bob Carr,suggested thatObama avoids sugar, carbs and fat, a regime which has allowed him entry into the auspicious elite of the flat-stomached.
Indeed, Obama is rarely spotted drinking fizzy soft drinks, chowing down on crazy unhealthy fast food or imbibing sugar like it's the end of days.Early in his first term at the White House, the Obamas made a splash by planting the firstvegetable gardenon the property since Eleanor Roosevelt's during the Second World War.
The garden, which was cared for and run byMichelle Obama, provided food for family meals and organic dinners alike, and served to raise awareness about healthy eating.
It included over 55 varieties of vegetables, mostly suggested by kitchen staff, and counted tomatillos, peppers, lettuces, spinach, kale, berries and more in its line-up.Chili is his number one recipeShutterstockObama has a whole list of favorite foods that have been made public, but one of the recipes that stands at the very top is chili.
Barack Obama's very own homemade chili recipe, which isavailable onlinethanks to Michelle, stems from their time in Chicago, where they'd invite friends and family over to enjoy it.
Wouldn't you love to be one of those lucky Chicago natives who can say they've been served dinner by the former President?
It's a turkey or beef-based recipe and utilizes red wine vinegar, turmeric and basil among the staple ingredients, like kidney beans, onions, peppers and so on.
Serve over rice or with a healthy topping of crushed crackers, and you're good to go.If you're planning on hosting a partisan political Tex-Mex theme night (and why wouldn't you?)
we'd suggest combining Obama's chili recipe with theTrump Grill taco bowlto really see who's got it best.He won't say no to a burgerWhile health may be at the forefront of Obama's eating habits, that's not to say that he doesn't indulge in a treat every now and again.
Just like his successor (well, okay, notjustlike his successor), Obama has a fondness for burgers and isn't averse to stopping at a take-out every now and again.
Unlike Trump, however, he always tended to prefer smaller, local burger joints rather than the larger chain restaurants — in 2009, for example, he and V.P.
Joe Biden took their motorcade to Ray's Hell Burger, an Arlington-based eatery known for its unusual burger toppings.Only a year later, Obama returned to Ray's Hell Burger with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.
They sat amongst a crowd of onlookers as Obama opted for a standard cheeseburger, while Medvedev had one with jalapenos, mushrooms and onions.
They shared an order of fries.Dijon disasterOh boy.
We hope you're ready for this one, because we're about to delve into the most shocking scandal to have ever rocked the Obama Administration.
If you're just here to read fun things about food, skip to the next item (it's about chocolate!
 because things are going to get pretty heavy in here.The year was 2011.
The scene was the previously mentioned Ray's Hell Burger.
The witnesses were Joe Biden, a press pack, a crowd of burgers fans and Sean Hannity's ego.
The crime, of course, was Obama ordering Dijon mustard on his burger.
Yes, Obama eschewed the traditional condimental topping of ketchupin favor of its spicier, yellower and Frencher cousin.
America's right-wing press immediately went on the attack, with Fox News' Hannity — presumably bored of waiting more a more delicious scandal to come along (only five more years, Sean!)
 running a segment which dubbed him "President Poupon.
He adores one chocolatier more than any otherShutterstockPhew.
That was a lot, right?
After such an intense dive into the depths of political and ethical depravity, you might want to kick back and enjoy something lighter.
Well, here's something — Obama's favorite chocolatier.Fran's Chocolatesis a Seattle-based chocolatier set up by Fran Bigelow, which Obama revealed in May 2008 as a personal love of his.It began with Seattle businesswoman Cynthia Stroum, who introduced the Obamas to Fran's at a campaign stop by way of a welcome basket, and subsequently got them hooked.
The love of the chocolates spread to the Secret Service, who began asking after them, and then, somehow, to the cast of ABC'sThe Viewafter Michelle sent them a sample.
Michelle's preference is for dark chocolate, while Barack himself allegedly goes for smoked salt caramels in milk chocolate.
And when you've got a President, a First Lady, the Secret Service, and a daytime talk show clamoring for more, it's fair to say you can make good chocolate.He brews his own beerThe Obamas aren't exactly binge-drinkers, but when they do indulge in a beer or two, at least they do it right.
In 2014, Obama was grantedlifetime membershipto the American Homebrewers Association in recognition of his position as the first President to home brew at the White House.
In 2011, he had teamed up with his chef Sam Kass to begin crafting their own beer and, with the help of local home brewers, concocted two recipes: one for White House Honey Ale and the other for White House Honey Porter.The honey porter includes black malt, chocolate malt, and honey, while the ale utilizes biscuit malt, gypsum and honey in its recipe.
The honey that's used isparticularly special, drawn from the apiary on the White House's South Lawn and offering a paler and lighter honey than most.
Considering the current President claims tonever touch alcohol, it's unlikely that the hives are producing honey for home brews anymore — if they're still there at all.His favorite foodsShutterstockAt the end of the day, it's easiest to get a feeling for someone's eating habits simply by taking a gander at their favorite and least favorite foods.According to Reggie Love, Obama's picks include chocolates from Fran's Chocolates (but you knew that), trail mix (nuts, berries, seeds, raisins and so on), roasted almonds, pistachio nuts, water, Dentyne Ice chewing gum, MET-Rx chocolate roasted peanut protein bars and vegetables — with broccoli and spinach being particular favs.You can see an image forming already, can't you?
Healthy with a tendency towards a guilty pleasure or two" is the bottom line, here, and the Obama diet seems to consist mostly of vegetables, health foods and simplicities (water, Barack?
Really?
 with little room for anything ostentatious, beyond a chocolate or two.
Love explains that Obama also uses Nicorette gum, though that may be because of another guilty pleasure of his rather than any particular appreciation for it.His least favorite foodsShutterstockThe other end of the spectrum, asLove tells it, is a little more peculiar.
Obama's food-related bugbears would appear to include mayonnaise (though, if Dijongate is anything to go by, he's not a massive fan of ketchup, either), salt and vinegar potato chips, asparagus — though he'll eat it if he has to, apparently — and soft drinks.
The man prefers water, you see.In the past, Obama has also voiced aparticular distastefor British cuisine, making clear his dislike of traditional British food on the campaign trail in 2007 with a (probably half-joking, in fairness) sneer and a cringe, before suggesting to a voter that her notion of England having better food than America was down to "all those good Indian restaurants they have there now."
So there you have it: Gum, nuts and water are in, asparagus, mayo and fish and chips are out.
President Barack Obama, everybody.Recommended

When Obamacare was being debated in the Supreme Court in 2010, the question of whether the government couldmandatethat Americans eat a certain amount of broccoli because it is healthy was argued.There is a question, however, as to whether Obama’s love of broccoli is new.
During the 2012 election, Scholasticcitedthe commander in chief’s favorite foods as chili, french fries and pork chops.
Obama has also talked about his love ofnachos, his favorite junk food.Perhaps the president’s new found love of broccoli came from learning new ways to cook it?

When later questioned on this claim, he swore it was the truth.
Apparently broccoli is one of his staples, although Michelle is keen toadd spinachto hisdaily dose of green vegetables.CheeseburgersShutterstockIfObamacould only order one meal for the rest of time, it would likely bea Cheddar cheeseburger.
He'll eat one whenever he can, especially when he's on the road.
However, Michelle tries to tame this rather unhealthy habit by swappingthe cheeseburgerfora turkey burgerwhen they're at home.For the Cheddar Cheeseburger With Caramelized Shallots recipe, click here.Cheese ToastThinkstockObama is certainly very proud of his "cheese toast," one of his specialty dishes.
Though we don't know his exact method or preferred ingredients for making thiscomfort food, we're glad to know that he loves this simple dish as much as the rest of us.Fresh ApplesShutterstockThere will always bea full bowl of appleson the coffee table in the Oval Office.

However, he can make aclassic batch of chili, using anold family recipehe has followed since childhood.
When he doesn't have time to stir up a pot himself, he'll orderthe Half-Smoke at the D.C. institution Ben's Chili Bowl.For the Chili Con Carne recipe, click here.MET-Rx BarsItemMasterObama tends to keep quiet about what brands or exact food products he really likes or dislikes, but he can't resist sharing his love of the chocolateroasted peanutprotein MET-Rx barswith the world.Milk ChocolateFacebook/Fran's ChocolatesWhenalmonds,trail mix, andprotein barsjust don't quite cut that snack craving, Obama will indulge on hisfavorite chocolate, which ishomemade milk chocolatefromSeattle-based Fran's Chocolates.NutsThinkstockAlmonds,pistachios, andmacadamiasare all enjoyed by the president on a daily basis.

Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday because, more than any other, it is uniquely American," he said in hisweekly address.
Each of us brings our own traditions and cultures and recipes to the table, but we all share this day, united by the gratitude for the bounty of this nation.
And we welcome the contributions of all people - no matter their origin or color or beliefs - who call America home, and who enrich the life of our nation.
It is a creed as old as our founding: 'E pluribus unum' -- that out of many, we are one," he added.
We are reminded that this creed, and America itself, was never an inevitability, but the result of ordinary people in every generation doing their part to uphold our founding ideals.

He promised to say an extra prayer for those service members away from home and vowed a renewed commitment "to take care of you as well as you've taken care of us.
He also thanked the "countless" Americans who give back to their communities by volunteering in soup kitchens or homeless shelters.
This generosity, this compassion, this belief that we are each other's keepers, is essential to who we are, not just on this day, but every day," he said.Mr.
Obama said he planned to spend his day with family and friends, good food and football.
But before we lift a fork, we lend a hand to go out in the community to serve some of our neighbors in need," he said.
On Wednesday, the president and his family helped distribute food to needy families at Bread for the City, a volunteer charity organization in Washington, D.C.In the weekly Republican address, which was also released Thursday, Senator-elect Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, recalled the history of Thanksgiving, from its original celebration by the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock to its renewal during the American Revolution, the Civil War, and World War II.Cotton is currently a congressman, but he'll join thenew Republican majority in the Senatein January, thanks to his defeat of incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor.He urged Americans to reflect on their blessings, despite the challenges that many face.
And he paused to extend a particularly hearty thank you to military members and their families.
For many, there will be no homecoming this week.
FromAfghanistantoIraqto Korea, our troops continue to patrol the world to bring peace and security for us all," he said.
To each of you, on behalf of the people of a grateful nation, I extend our deepest thanks for your honorable and faithful service.
Cotton remembered his own Thanksgiving spent abroad during his time in uniform.
Nine years ago, I was at Ranger School for Thanksgiving; six years ago, it was Mehtar Lam, Afghanistan," he said.
While we deeply missed our own families, we also celebrated together as a second, surrogate family.
He thanked the families of service members for their own sacrifice.
As you see the empty seat at your table this Thanksgiving," he told them, "please know that your sons and daughters, husbands and wives, moms and dads miss you dearly, but are enjoying the next best thing to home: the camaraderie and love of their brothers and sisters in arms.

He gave thanks for the many Americans who sacrifice every day, from volunteer workers who serve their communities, to men and women in uniform who serve us all.On Thanksgiving, a holiday that is uniquely American, he reminded us to focus on what unites -- our commitment to American ideals like justice and equality and our gratitude and love for our country.Embedded video for Weekly Address: Happy Thanksgiving from the Obama FamilyMP4MP3Remarks of President Barack ObamaWeekly AddressThe White HouseNovember 27, 2014On behalf of the Obama family -- Michelle, Malia, Sasha, Bo, and Sunny -- I want to wish you a very happy Thanksgiving.
Like many of you, we'll spend the day with family and friends, catching up, eating some good food and watching a little football.
Before we lift a fork, we lend a hand by going out in the community to serve some of our neighbors in need.
And we give thanks for each other, and for all of God's blessings.Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday because, more than any other, it is uniquely American.
Each of us brings our own traditions and cultures and recipes to the table -- but we all share this day, united by the gratitude for the bounty of this nation.
And we welcome the contributions of all people -- no matter their origin or color or beliefs -- who call America home, and who enrich the life of our nation.
It is a creed as old as our founding: "E pluribus unum" -- that our of many, we are one.We are reminded that this creed, and America itself, was never an inevitability, but the result of ordinary people in every generation doing their part to uphold our founding ideals -- by taking the blessings of freedom, and multiplying them for those who would follow.
As President Kennedy once wrote, even as we give thanks for all that we've inherited from those who came before us -- "the decency of purpose, steadfastness of resolve and strength of will, for the courage and the humility, which they posessed," we must also remember that "the highest appreciation is not to utter words but to live by them.
Today, we are grateful to all Americans who do their part to live by those ideals, including our brave men and women in uniform overseas and their families, who sacrifice so much to keep America safe.
To our service members who are away from home, we say an extra prayer for you and your loved ones, and we renew our commitment to take care of you as well as you've taken care of us.We are grateful to the countless Americans who serve their communities in soup kitchens and shelters, looking out for those who are less fortunate, and lifting up those who have fallen on hard times.
This generosity, this compassion, this belief that we are each other's keepers, is essential to who we are, not just on this day, but every day.It's easy to focus on what separates us.
But as we gather with loved ones on this Thanksgiving, let's remember and be grateful for what binds us together.
Our love of country.
Our commitment to justice and equality.
Our belief that America's best days are ahead, and that her destiny is ours to shape -- and that our inherited ideals must be the birthright of all of our children.That's what today is all about: that out of many, we are one.
Thank you, God bless you, and from my family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving.Share This:TwitterFacebookEmailTwitterInstagramFacebookGoogle+YoutubeMore ways to engageContact UsEmailHomeBriefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest NewsShare-WorthyPhotosVideo GalleryLive EventsMusic & Arts PerformancesFrom the Press OfficeYour Weekly AddressSpeeches & RemarksPress BriefingsStatements & ReleasesWhite House SchedulePresidential ActionsLegislationNominations & AppointmentsDisclosuresIssuesPopular TopicsThe RecordCabinet Exit MemosCriminal Justice ReformCubaSee AllTop IssuesCivil RightsClimate ChangeEconomyEducationForeign PolicyHealth CareIran DealImmigration ActionMoreDefenseDisabilitiesEthicsEqual PayHomeland SecurityReducing Gun ViolenceRuralServiceMoreSeniors & Social SecurityTaxesTechnologyTradeUrban and Economic MobilityVeteransWomenThe AdministrationPeoplePresident Barack ObamaVice President Joe BidenFirst Lady Michelle ObamaDr.

And we give thanks for each other, and for all of God’s blessings,” Obama said a day after his family volunteered at a southeast Washington, D.C., food bank.“Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday because, more than any other, it is uniquely American.
Each of us brings our own traditions and cultures and recipes to the table – but we all share this day, united by the gratitude for the bounty of this nation,” Obama said.The president will spend the day with friends and family “eating some good food and watching a little football,” Obama said in his weekly address Thursday, released two days early due to the shortened workweek.Obama, a longtime Chicago Bears (5-6) fan, is sure to be cheering for his home state team as the underdogs go up against the Detroit Lions (7-4) starting around lunchtime on the East Coast.Other games Thursday include head-to-head matchups between the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys (both 8-3) in the afternoon and between the Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers (both 7-4) in the evening.
Obama welcomed the Super Bowl champion Seahawks to the White House in May, where he said, “I root for the underdogs.”The president has been known to watch football, saying he planned to do the same last year on Thanksgiving, and has tossed pigskin around on the South Lawn to promote child fitness.
But in an interview earlier this year, Obama raised some eyebrows among avid football fans when he said he would not allow his own son play the sport.“At this point, there’s a little bit of caveat emptor,” he toldThe New Yorker, suggesting NFL players understood the impact of concussions.
These guys, they know what they’re doing.
They know what they’re buying into.
It is no longer a secret.
It’s sort of the feeling I have about smokers, you know?”Obama joined others in September when he was reportedly “shocked” by a video of former Baltimore Raven running back Ray Rice in February knocking out his then-fiancee in a hotel elevator.
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell faced much criticism, as well as questions from some lawmakers, for the league’s handling of the case after video emerged of the incident.The president’s Thursday dining comes exactly a week after announcing during the pregame for Thursday Night Football his plan to give legal status to five million illegal immigrants, a primetime move largely criticized by Republicans after Democrats were pounded in the midterm elections.Obama on Wednesday poked fun at those who criticized his executive action, saying while pardoning a turkey: “I know some will call this amnesty, but don’t worry, there is plenty of turkey to go around.”The president said in his address Thursday that “we welcome the contributions of all people – no matter their origin or color or beliefs – who call America home, and who enrich the life of our nation.”TagsCopyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

They also thanked our brave troops and their families for their service and sacrifice, and reminded everyone to visit JoiningForces.gov to find ways to give back to our military families this year.
Both the President and First Lady said that during this holiday season, we should all come together to find ways to support our communities, continue caring for each other and keep working to be the best parents, children, friends, neighbors, and citizens we can be.Embedded video for Weekly Address: The President and First Lady Wish Everyone a Happy Holiday SeasonMP4MP3Remarks of President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle ObamaWeekly AddressThe White HouseDecember 25, 2013THE PRESIDENT:Hello everybody, and happy holidays.THE FIRST LADY:We know how busy this time of year is for everyone, so we’re not going to take much of your time.But we did want to take a moment to wish you all a Merry Christmas, from our family to yours.THE PRESIDENT:This is a season for millions of Americans to be together with family, to continue long-held holiday traditions, and to show our gratitude to those we love.
And along the way, some of us might even watch a little basketball or eat some Christmas cookies, too.THE FIRST LADY:Here at the White House, over the past few weeks, we’ve had about 70,000 people from all across the country come visit us and look at our holiday decorations.This year’s theme was “Gather Around: Stories of the Season.”And in every room of the house, we tried to tell a story about who we are as Americans and how we celebrate the holidays together.And we made certain to highlight some of the most powerful stories we know – the stories of our outstanding troops, veterans, and military families and their service and sacrifice for our country.THE PRESIDENT:Our extraordinary men and women in uniform are serving so that the rest of us can enjoy the blessings we cherish during the holidays.
But that means many of our troops are far from home and far from family.
They’re spending some extra time on the phone with their loved ones back home.
Or they’re setting up video chats so they can watch as the presents are opened.
So today, we want all of our troops to know that you’re in our thoughts and prayers this holiday season.And here’s the good news: For many of our troops and newest veterans, this might be the first time in years that they’ve been with their families on Christmas.
In fact, with the Iraq war over and the transition in Afghanistan, fewer of our men and women in uniform are deployed in harm’s way than at any time in the last decade.THE FIRST LADY: And that’s something we all can be thankful for.And with more and more of our troops back here at home, now it’s our turn to serve – it’s our turn to step up and show our gratitude for the military families who have given us so much.And that’s why Jill Biden and I started our Joining Forces initiative – to rally all Americans to support our military families in ways large and small.And again and again, we have been overwhelmed by the response we’ve gotten as folks from across the country have found new ways to give back to these families through their schools, businesses, and houses of worship.THE PRESIDENT:That’s the same spirit of giving that connects all of us during the holidays.
So many people all across the country are helping out at soup kitchens, buying gifts for children in need, or organizing food or clothing drives for their neighbors.
For families like ours, that service is a chance to celebrate the birth of Christ and live out what He taught us – to love our neighbors as we would ourselves; to feed the hungry and look after the sick; to be our brother’s keeper and our sister’s keeper.
And for all of us as Americans, regardless of our faith, those are values that can drive us to be better parents and friends, better neighbors and better citizens.THE FIRST LADY:So as we look to the New Year, let’s pledge ourselves to living out those values by reaching out and lifting up those in our communities who could use a hand up.THE PRESIDENT:So Merry Christmas, everyone.
And from the two of us, as well as Malia, Sasha, Grandma, Bo…THE FIRST LADY:And Sunny, the newest Obama.THE PRESIDENT:We wish youall a blessed and safe holiday season.THE FIRST LADY:Happy holidays everybody, and God bless.###TwitterInstagramFacebookGoogle+YoutubeMore ways to engageContact UsEmailHomeBriefing RoomFrom the News RoomLatest NewsShare-WorthyPhotosVideo GalleryLive EventsMusic & Arts PerformancesFrom the Press OfficeYour Weekly AddressSpeeches & RemarksPress BriefingsStatements & ReleasesWhite House SchedulePresidential ActionsLegislationNominations & AppointmentsDisclosuresIssuesPopular TopicsThe RecordCabinet Exit MemosCriminal Justice ReformCubaSee AllTop IssuesCivil RightsClimate ChangeEconomyEducationForeign PolicyHealth CareIran DealImmigration ActionMoreDefenseDisabilitiesEthicsEqual PayHomeland SecurityReducing Gun ViolenceRuralServiceMoreSeniors & Social SecurityTaxesTechnologyTradeUrban and Economic MobilityVeteransWomenThe AdministrationPeoplePresident Barack ObamaVice President Joe BidenFirst Lady Michelle ObamaDr.

The annual list is always an eclectic collection of cinema that reveals a wide-ranging taste that rivals that of professional film critics.“I always look forward to sharing my lists of favorite books, movies, and music with all of you,” Obama tweeted, before beginning his rollout of his picks from the culture he consumed.For his films, he tweeted December 23, “I saw some great movies this year — here are some of my favorites.” His list put Steven Spielberg’s “The Fabelmans” at the top, followed by Park Chan-wook’s murder-mystery “Decision to Leave” and Gina Prince-Bythewood’s “The Woman King.”Obama’s list also included “Aftersun,” “Emily the Criminal,” “Petite Maman,” “Happening,” “Till,” “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” “Top Gun: Maverick,” “The Good Boss,” “Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy,” “A Hero,” “Hit the Road,” “TÁR,” and “After Yang.” He also included “Descendant” with the caveat that, since it was produced by his production company Higher Ground, he’s biased in its favor.RelatedEvery Studio Film Directed by Filmmakers of Color Coming Out in 2023 and 2024Every Studio Film Directed by Female Filmmakers Coming Out in 2023 and 2024Related2023 Emmys Predictions: Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or a Movie'Song of the South': 13 Things to Know About Disney's Most Controversial MovieSeven of his picks echo IndieWire’sown top 10 of the year, including “The Fabelmans,” “After Yang,” “Decision to Leave,” and “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” though IndieWire declared “Aftersun” the best of the year.Many of Obama’s 2021 picks went on to earn Oscar nominations (and the gold).

He also included Stacy Schiff's Founding Father biography,The Revolutionary: Samuel Adams, as well as novels by Charmaine Wilkerson (Black Cake) and Hernan Diaz (Trust).
Imani Perry's historical text,South to America: A Journey Below the Mason-Dixon to Understand the Soul of a Nation, also made the listObama's movie choices run the gamut fromViola Davis' war epicThe Woman KingtoTom Cruise's epic sequelTop Gun: MavericktoMichelle Yeohjust being epic inEverything Everywhere All At Once.
He also really enjoyedCate Blanchette's tour de force inTar,Steve Spielberg's coming-of-age dramaThe Fabelmans, the story of Emmett Till told through his mother's eyes,Till, and the documentaryDescendant, which he and Michelle produced through their Higher Ground company.And finally, what's got Barack Obama busting out his world-famous dad dance moves?Beyoncé's "Break My Soul,"Lizzo's "About Damn Time,"Bad Bunny's "Tití Me Preguntó,"Maggie Rogers' "That's Where I Am," andRosalía's "Saoko" all made the list of his fave tunes of the year.But what about TV?
Is all that book-reading, movie-watching, and music-listening cutting into his TV-binging time?
Maybe even former presidents think there's too much content, but we would still really like to hear his thoughts onThe White Lotusfinale.Related content:The best books of 2022The 10 best movies of 2022 (and 5 worst)The 10 best songs of 2022CommentsClose this dialog windowShare & MoreEW.comMagazines & MoreLearn MoreSubscribethis link opens in a new tabAdvertisethis link opens in a new tabConnectSubscribe to Our NewsletterMeredith© Copyright 2023 Meredith Corporation.

He evendissed Kanye.Butknowing your way around pop culture isn't enough.
It's also about taste.Over the years, Obama has talked about the books, movies, and TV shows he likes the most.Taken together, they create a portrait of a man who’s deeply occupied with American stories, the nature of identity, and just getting away from being the leader of the free world for a while.Let's take a look at Obama's pop culture picks:Obama’s favorite movies are “The Godfather” and “The Godfather II.”Paramount PicturesOne of our most important clues about Obama's favorite works of pop culture isa Facebook postpromoting the Trans-Pacific Partnership and defending the importance of copyright laws.
In it, he said his favorite movies are the first two “Godfather” films.
It’s a smart pick — the two movies are classic American stories and widely-regarded masterpieces of cinema.“There’s this combination of old world gentility and ritual, with this savagery underneath,”Obama told MTV.
It’s all about family.
So it’s a great movie.”He’s also really into classics.Screen grab/CasablancaHisother favoritesinclude “Casablanca,” “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” and “Lawrence of Arabia,” all of which are Oscar winners.AsObama said, “Who doesn’t like Casablanca?”Him and Michelle watched “Do the Right Thing” on their first date.At an event honoring the movie's 25th anniversary, Barack and Michelle Obamarecountedthe time they first watched the Spike Lee movie: their first date.
He was trying to show me his sophisticated side by selecting an independent filmmaker," Michelle said.
It ended up being a pretty good movie.
Do the Right Thing' still holds up a mirror to our society, and it makes us laugh, and think, and challenges all of us to see ourselves in one another,” Barack Obama said.Their first date wasadapted into a movie itself, called "Southside with You.
He’s also dropped the names of a few movies he enjoyed during the course of his presidency.Aidan Monaghan/20th Century FoxIn 2015, he said he really enjoyed“The Martian,"though Michellepreferred Pixar’s "Inside Out."
He likedRichard Linklater’s “Boyhood"best in 2014, and hisfavorite 2012 movieswere "Beasts of the Southern Wild," "Life of Pi," and "Argo.
Star Wars” came out when Obama was a teenager — and he’s a fan.Obama awarded George Lucas the National Medal of Arts — the United States’ highest government award for artists — in 2012.
And at the end of his final press conference last year, on the eve of the release of "Star Wars: The Force Awakens," he told the press room that he was off to see the film.His favorite song is “What’s Going On” by Marvin Gaye.Marvin Gaye.AP / Doug PizacHe’sa big fanofMotown singer Marvin Gaye, though hisfavorite musical artist overall is Stevie Wonder.
When I was at that point where you start getting involved in music, Stevie had that run with 'Music of My Mind,' 'Talking Book,' 'Fulfillingness' First Finale'and 'Innervisions,' and then 'Songs in the Key of Life,'" Obama told Rolling Stone in 2008.
Those are as brilliant a set of five albums as we've ever seen.
In fact, Obama’s taste in music is pretty grounded in the classics.REUTERS/Robert GalbraithHe's been endorsed by Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen, and endorses their music in turn:"I've got probably 30 Dylan songs on my iPod,"he told Rolling Stone.
And while he’s not a Deadhead ("I don't wear tie-dye and I've never followed them around any­where.
 he does listen to The Grateful Dead, as well as Earth, Wind and Fire, Elton John, and The Rolling Stones ("Gimme Shelter" is his favorite song of theirs).In high school, he started listening to more jazz.Jazz trumpeter Miles Davis is pictured during the opening concert of the annual North Sea Jazz Festival in The Hague, July 12, 1987.AP Photo/Ton PouwHe started listening to Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, and John Coltrane, before moving on to Howlin' Wolf, Yo-Yo Ma, Sheryl Crow, and Jay-Z.Like many people, Obama grudgingly admires Kanye West, though he prefers Jay-Z.Dimitrios Kambouris/GettyThere’s a kind of taste test in hip-hop music: Do you prefer Kanye West or Jay-Z?When asked this question by The Atlantic,his answer was Jay-Z—  he and Beyoncé are currently American music’s first family, after all.But he also can’t help but like Kanye.
He called him "a jackass" — presumably a judgment on Kanye’s arrogant public persona — but also "talented.
He likes other contemporary music, too.Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images for NARASHisfavorite song of 2015is“How Much a Dollar Cost” by Kendrick Lamar(Michelle prefers“Uptown Funk”).Last year, he alsorevealeda “summer playlist” on Spotify that demonstrates a more eclectic taste, and includes Sly & The Family Stone, Coldplay, Arcade Fire, and Florence + The Machine.He grew up reading comic books like “Conan the Barbarian” and "Spider-Man.
Universal PicturesIn an email to supporters, Obama wrote “I grew up loving comic books.
Back in the day, I was pretty into Conan the Barbarian and Spiderman.” He forgot the hyphen in Spider-Man, though, which amounts to scandal in the comic book universe.He thinks “The Wire” is the greatest television show of all time.HBO via YouTubeThe critically acclaimed HBO drama often tops lists of the best TV series of this century, but Obama takes it a step further and calls it the best TV show of all time.
He calls Omar, one of the show’s central characters, “the toughest, baddest guy on the show.”But he’s also named “M*A*S*H” his favorite TV show.20th Century FoxIn an offhand comment at a fundraiser in Minneapolis, hecalled the war comedy his favorite show.When he's got a minute, he'll catch up on HBO dramas.HBO/"Boardwalk Empire"With his family, he’ll watch episodes of "Modern Family" and "Parks and Recreation" when it was on the air.
But without his kids, he said helikes to sneakin episodes of "darker" shows, like "Homeland" and "Boardwalk Empire.
He alsowatches "House of Cards,"according to The New York Times, and hisfavorite show of 2015was "The Knick."
He alsoliked "Mad Men"(it “explains my grandparents, their tastes”), as well as "Entourage" and "Downton Abbey.
One of the perks of being president is that he gets to see who dies on “Game of Thrones” before everyone else.HBOThe showrunners said thatthe White House requested screener copiesof the new season before the premiere.
When the commander-in-chief says 'I want to see advanced episodes,' what are you gonna do?"
producer David Benioff said.He’s a Trekkie.Paramount PicturesHe’s been known toflash the Vulcan salutefrom time to time, and as a teenager had a crush on Nichelle Nichols, who played Lieutenant Uhura in the show.
But he lost some of his credibility with “Star Trek” fans in 2013, when hereferredto the “Vulcan mind meld” as the “Jedi mind meld.”He’s really into BatDad.It’shis favorite viral meme.
Whoever BatDad is out there, man, I was into your thing,” he told People.Obama’s favorite novel is “Song of Solomon” by Toni Morrison.President Barack Obama looks to author Toni Morrison before awarding her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, Tuesday, May 29, 2012, in the East Room of the White House in Washington.AP Photo/Carolyn KasterIt’s a little surprising that he didn’t pick “Beloved,” which is often considered the Nobel laureate’s best book.
But “Song of Solomon,” about a loose group of black strivers in magical-realist Michigan, is a sensitive pick.Since 2008, Morrison has become close to the president.
She wrote aflattering letter endorsing him, and heenlisted heras a member of his braintrust to map out his post-presidency, and awarded her a Medal of Freedom in 2012.He also admires author Marilynne Robinson, and considers her book “Gilead” one of his favorites.President Barack Obama, accompanied by Pulitzer Prize winning Iowa writer Marilynne Robinson, arrives to the State Library of Iowa in the Ola Babcock Miller Building, Monday, Sept. 14, 2015, in Des Moines.

He’s long considered her book “Gilead” one of his favorites, andawarded herthe National Medal of Arts in 2013.His taste in books show that he’s a student of American literature and history.Wikimedia CommonsOnhis Facebook page, Obama says his favorite books include "Moby-Dick," Ralph Waldo Emerson’s "Self-Reliance," Lincoln’s collected writings, and “Parting the Waters: America in the King Years 1954-63,” a volume by Taylor Branch about the civil rights movement.Elsewhere, he identified himself as a fan of Doris Kearns Goodwin’s “Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,” which is widely cited as the book that made him pick his onetime political rival Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State.In an interview with Rolling Stone, ObamaidentifiedErnest Hemingway’s “For Whom the Bell Tolls” as a book that inspires him.
Curiously, he considered “the tragedies of William Shakespeare” inspiring as well.
He also, of course, counts The Bible among his favorite books.A lot of his favorite books also grapple with themes of identity.Ralph Ellison, New York author, is a witness, August 30, 1966, at a Senate Subcommittee hearing in Washington during continuing hearings on the racial problems in big cities.AP PhotoAmong themDoris Lessing’s "Golden Notebook," Ellison’s "Invisible Man," and F.

And in 2010, Rowling was invited to read from "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" on the White House lawn during the annual Easter egg roll.But he's also known to keep up with contemporary literary fiction.AmazonEvery November, Obama makes a show of visiting an independent bookstore on Small Business Saturday.

But how many have you seen — or even heard of?
Ranging from blockbusters (“Top Gun: Maverick”) to foreign films that cover issues of reproductive rights (“Happening”), Obama’s tastes are varied.
Here’s his list, with some critical appraisals and information on how to watch them.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightThe FabelmansReturn to menuThis semi-autobiographical coming-of-age tale loosely depicts director Steven Spielberg’s formative years falling in love with storytelling.
Post movie critic Ann Hornaday agreed with the hype, giving it 3½ stars in her review,writing: “From an early age, Spielberg is telling us, he’s understood cinema’s power to entertain, immerse, inform and transport, and as a way to create a usable past.
The Fabelmans’ does it all, with an expansive spirit and that quintessential Spielbergian combination of honesty and sentiment.”(In theaters and available for purchase on several streaming services, including YouTube and Apple TV Plus)Decision to LeaveReturn to menuA South Korean romantic thriller, “Decision to Leave” follows a detective investigating a man’s death while battling emerging feelings for the widow involved in the case.
Post movie critic Michael O’Sullivan gave this film two stars and a less sparkling recommendation than the former president.
Decision to Leave’ is also needlessly complicated and at times almost impossible to follow, its narrative inscrutability often coming across less as the result of nonlinear storytelling than as simply a cinematic affectation,” O’Sullivanwrote.
Streams on Mubi and available for purchase on Apple TV Plus)The Woman KingReturn to menuSet in the 1800s, a collective of female warriors protects their African kingdom from danger.
But as a new, foreign threat emerges, the next generation must step up to continue their way of life.
Hornaday, who gave the film 3½ stars, praises Viola Davis’ performance: “‘The Woman King’ may be a fable, but its power is real: Her name is Viola Davis, and she’s nothing less than magnificent,” shewrote.
Available for rent on several streaming services, including VUDU and Prime Video)AftersunReturn to menuA young woman reflects on the holiday she spent with her father 20 years ago, when she was 11 — coming to terms with the father she knew in her youth and the man she didn’t really understand.
This melancholic recollection of childhood earned three stars from O’Sullivan, whowroteabout the film: “The seemingly happiest moments of childhood, [director Charlotte]Wells seems to argue, can take on somber overtones when seen in the rearview mirror.”(Available for purchase on several streaming services, including Apple TV Plus and Prime Video)Emily the CriminalReturn to menuA college graduate (Aubrey Plaza) with overwhelming debt and no career prospects becomes immersed in a scam where she acts as a dummy shopper and buys increasingly luxurious products with stolen credit cards.
O’Sullivan gavethe filmthree stars but credited most of what he enjoyed to Plaza.
A kind of gravitational pull emanates from Aubrey Plaza as the title character in … a passably diverting crime thriller where, in place of a moral center, Plaza delivers a performance that is entertainingly blackhearted,” O’Sullivanwrote.
Streams on Netflix)Petite MamanReturn to menuThis French fantasy drama centers on an 8-year-old girl named Nelly who lost her grandmother and is cleaning out her home.
After Nelly’s mom abruptly departs, she meets a girl her age in the woods.
O’Sullivan gave it a strong, four-starreview: “‘Petite Maman’ is what every film should be: powerfully, even arrestingly original; grounded in emotional truth; hyper-specific; deeply universal; strange; mesmerizing; and not a minute longer than necessary.”(Streams on Hulu)DescendantReturn to menuOne of the films Obama touted is a documentary from the production company he heads with his wife, Michelle.
This film follows the descendants of the survivors from the last known slave ship to arrive in the United States as they try to take control of their legacy and find connection with their ancestors.
Streams on Netflix)HappeningReturn to menuA French drama set in 1963 that follows a bright student who decides to take matters into her own hands when unplanned pregnancy threatens her academic dreams.
Streams on AMC Plus)TillReturn to menuBased on the true story of Mamie Till-Mobley (Danielle Deadwyler), who relentlessly pursued justice after her 14-year-old son, Emmett Till, was brutally lynched in 1955.
O’Sullivan gave it four stars,writingthatthe film“is many things: a portrait of Emmett Till, vibrant with the promise of life; the riveting retelling of a true-crime tale; a doomed courtroom drama about justice undelivered; and a glimpse at the backroom strategizing of the early civil rights movement’s players.”(Available for purchase on several streaming services, including Google Play and Apple TV Plus)Everything Everywhere All At OnceReturn to menuAn aging Chinese immigrant (Michelle Yeoh)is set on a multiversal course to save the world and better connect with the people she loves.
O’Sullivan gave the film 2½ stars,writing: “It’s hard to know what to make of ‘Everything Everywhere All at Once.’ It’s a tour de force — but of what?
It’s exhausting.
It’s funny.
It’s confusing.
It’s way too long and feels like it has multiple endings.”(Streams on Paramount Plus)Top Gun: MaverickReturn to menuThe sequel to 1986’s “Top Gun” dominated the box office and earned critical acclaim.
Maverick (Tom Cruise) is back and training a group of graduates for an assignment where he must confront his past ghosts.
Hornaday put it on hertop 10 moviesof the year and wrote in her 3½ starreview: “This is what the movies looked like, once.
And this is what they can look like again.”(Streams on Paramount Plus)The Good BossReturn to menuThis Spanish workplace comedy starring Javier Bardem focuses on the owner of an industrial scales manufacturing business who tries to resolve any problems that his workers have while he waits to hear if his company will be given an award.

In O’Sullivan’s three-star review, hewrote: “The movie takes place in Iran, yet it’s really situated in the crack of daylight that separates truth from a lie.
It’s a tight squeeze, [director Asghar] Farhadi seems to say, and one whose pinch this tragedy of the everyday makes us feel, acutely.”(Streams on Prime Video)Hit the RoadReturn to menuAnother Iranianfilm, this one about a middle-aged couple and their two sons who drive across the countryside to bond, bicker and grapple with the future.
Streams on Paramount Plus)TárReturn to menuFamed (and fictional) conductor Lydia Tár (Cate Blanchett) begins to spiral as she embarks on a symphony recording that will elevate her career.
Anotherfilmon Hornaday’stop-10 list, the critic gave the film four stars andwrote: “Watching Cate Blanchett inhabit the most indelible character to materialize on-screen this year is to witness a fascinating feat of artistic doubling, wherein Blanchett brings her angular physicality and a quick, slashing intelligence to bear on a woman who’s creating herself in real time.”(In theaters and available for purchase on several streaming services, including YouTube and Apple TV Plus)After YangReturn to menuYang, a girl’s beloved android companion, malfunctions and her father (Colin Farrell)searches for a way to repair it before realizing he should focus on repairing the relationships he has neglected with his wife and daughter.
Giving the film two stars, Hornadaywrote: “As ‘After Yang’ delves into the memories that he’s collected — and that make him a collector’s item in his own right — the result is moving, but the surrounding movie still feels like it’s unfolding at an empyrean, and frankly rather dull, remove.”(Streams on Paramount Plus)CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...View moreLoading...CompanyAbout The PostNewsroom Policies & StandardsDiversity and InclusionCareersMedia & Community RelationsWP Creative GroupAccessibility StatementGet The PostGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StoreBooks & E-BooksNewspaper in EducationPrint Archives (Subscribers Only)Today’s PaperPublic NoticesContact UsContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareContact the Opinions teamAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com© 1996-2023 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2023 The Washington PostAbout The PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipReport a VulnerabilityDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyCookie SettingsPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices

During his first term in office, the president converted the White House tennis court into a basketball court, ensuring he would be able to play as often as possible.Fiercely competitive, the outgoing POTUS has been seen shooting around with college basketball teams during their visits to the White House.
He has even invited members of staff and NBA players to pickup games and reportedly said he would refuse to invite any athlete back if they didn't go hard on him.<a href="https://twitter.com/YesTheCap">@YesTheCap</a> ferguson playing basketball with Obama (2011) <a href="https://t.co/VzZMY8EFr7">pic.twitter.com/VzZMY8EFr7</a>&mdash;@NoMoreAnimeNot just a b-ballerWhile basketball might be the out-going president's first love, he has proven he can hang in other sporting spheres as well.
Like presidents before him, he has been bowling in the White House bowling alley, he's been golfing with Golden State Warriors Steph Curry, and even played ping pong with former British Prime Minister David Cameron during a visit to the U.K.The time David Cameron and Barack Obama played ping pong.

a href="http://t.co/XQ6M9TAcAm">pic.twitter.com/XQ6M9TAcAm</a>&mdash;@moustashley_Just another sports fanThroughout his tenure, Obama has been seen on the sidelines at a number of sporting events and even served as coach on his daughter Sasha's basketball team.He made headlines last year when during his historic visit to Cuba he attended an exhibition game between the Cuban national team and the Tampa Bay Rays, accompanied by President Raúl Castro.The U.S. president was even caught on the "Kiss Cam" with the first lady while attending a U.S. men's basketball team game against Brazil in Washington in 2012.President's big pitchIn 2009 Obama became the first U.S. president in 33 years to throw the ceremonial first pitch at the MLB all-star game.
Taking the mound at the game in St. Louis, the president boldly sported a Chicago White Sox jacket in support of his hometown team.
Luckily, his potentially controversial choice in allegiance was overshadowed by his now infamous fashion failing "dad jeans.
POTUS picksThroughout his presidency, Obama filling out the NCAA basketball bracket for ESPN became an annual tradition.
While his track record has not been great, having predicted only one winner in 2009, he has come close, picking teams that made it to the fourth round in 2011, 2012 and 2014.
Last year he chose Kansas, which made it to the final four before being illuminated by eventual winner Villanova.President Obama typically goes chalk in filling out his bracket.<br><br>The final Barack-etology: <a href="https://t.co/ycs1UF2uUj">https://t.co/ycs1UF2uUj</a> <a href="https://t.co/M3StKWCnKF">pic.twitter.com/M3StKWCnKF</a>&mdash;@espnChampions in the 'House'White house visits by championship teams is an American tradition.
Olympic medallists, NCAA winners and professional sports champions have all made their way to the executive mansion to receive congratulations from the president.Most recently on Monday the World Series champion Chicago Cubs paid him a visit, presenting Obama with a Cubs jersey fittingly endowed with the No.
44, for the 44th president.Outfielder Dexter Fowler took the meeting a step further, bringing the POTUS a custom pair of Jordan brand sneakers which he showed off on his Instagram account.Medal of FreedomThroughout his eight years in the presidency, Obama has awarded the Medal of Freedom to 12 athletes — more than any other U.S. president in history.
Regarded as the greatest civilian honour, some of the recipients during the Obama tenure have included baseball Hall of Famer Stan Musial, the late legendary women's college basketball coach Pat Summitt, and most recently NBA great Michael Jordan.Moved by the honour, the six-time NBA champion seemed to get emotional during the ceremony, almost bringing the "crying Michael Jordan" meme to life.CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBCSportsCorrections and clarifications|Report errorCommentsTo encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

President,Klain said,pretend you’re an all-offense, no-defense shooter — like the old Celtics guardPaul Westphal.
Romney’s going to score a lot of points.
You just have to outscore him.Obama’s preparation for the debate was dismal, according to Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s bookDouble Down.
Then–chief campaign strategist David Axelrod tried to reassure a colleague by saying, “Trust me, he’s a gamer.” But Axelrod was struck by Obama’s mood just before showtime.
In 2008, Obama had said before a debate, “Just give me the ball!” Now, he said, “Let’s just get this over with and get out of here.”Romney wound upclobbering Obamathat night.
When Obama faced his aides a few days later, he sounded like a losing quarterback: “It’s all on me.” Obama explained that his debating skills were as out of whack as Roy McAvoy’s golf game inTin Cup.As Obama threw himself into preparation for the next debate, Klain offered another sports metaphor.This debate is like theend of the Rams-Titans Super Bowl, Klain said.The difference between election and defeat — between Obamacare and repeal — could be a single yard.This was a typical sequence from the sports-mad presidency of Barack Obama.
Every president campaigns with athletes, arranges them as props at his State of the Union, and uses sports as alingua francato speak to Joe Sixpack.
Yet what Obama did was astounding.
He filled nearly every minute of his administration with sports talk — using it as entertainment, metaphor, and, finally, as a political weapon.
It was easy to miss that last aspect when Obama wastweeting about Jimmy Butler’s extension.The White House has known extremesports nerdery before.
Asked by a reporter in 1972 to come up with his all-time Major League Baseball team, Richard Nixon suppliedfourteams: American and National League teams for both pre- and post-1945.
Yet Obama ascended to a plane beyond what Nixon or any other president could dream of.
He didn’t just go on ESPN to fill in an NCAA bracket (“Barack-etology”) every year.
He filled in awomen’sbracket, too.Jason Chaffetz, the Republican congressman from Utah, once told me he thought Obama’s sports fandom was real and deep.
Conservatives had tweaked Obama for saying he watched his beloved White Sox at “Cominskey Field.”) But even Chaffetz couldn’t believe Obama was talking fluently about women’s basketball without glancing at talking points.
No way that was legit!”Like no president before, save maybe Gerald Ford, Obama could be understood through the prism of his favorite sport, basketball.
Michael Lewis followed Obama to a game for a2012Vanity Fairprofileand found metaphors for the Obama presidency strewn all over the court.
Four years after his ascension, Obama was no longer a transformational star — a max player — but a veteran facilitator like late-career Kevin Garnett.
He’s switched to trying to figure out how to make his team win,” Lewis wrote.
And there was this, from one of Obama’s fellow players: “Unlike a lot of lefties, he can go to his right.”In public, Obama was often remote.
In hoops, you could see a ruthless streak.
Obama liked playing at the basketball court at FBI headquarters, because the court was slightly smaller and, thus, it was easier for an old guy to assert himself.
The plan had been for Lewis and Obama to play on the same team, but Obama asked Lewis to sit until the team got a lead.
I was benched,” Lewis wrote.Writing inThe Undefeated, LZ Grandersonarguedthat Obama’s love of basketball may have worked as a tractor beam to pull players like LeBron James toward liberal causes.
NBA commissioner Adam Silvernotedanother effect: Because America had an African American president, a single basketball player committing a crime didn’t get the whole league dismissed as “thugs.”All of this was orchestrated by someone who didn’t have even a significant high-school basketball career.
During a 2008 campaign stop in Kuwait, Obama addressed troops on a court.
Then hewalked a basketballup to just outside the 3-point line.
I may not make the first one,” he said.
But I’ll make one eventually.” He let go of the ball, it went through the net, and Obama stuck both hands up in the air.It’s one thing to mix sports talk with presidential stagecraft.
Obama wanted more than that.
He wanted to be our sports-talk-host-in-chief, weighing in on the burning issues of the day.In 2013, ObamatoldThe New Republicthat if he had a son, “I’d have to think long and hard before I let him play football.” HetoldBill Simmons he couldn’t believe Roger Goodell made $44 million in one year.
Obama wasagainst the BCS,against stadium financing scams,against Donald Sterling(he called him “ignorant”), and thoughtcollege basketball’s shot clockshould be 30, rather than 35, seconds.None of these were exactly hot takes.
Indeed, when he talked sports, Obama sounded like your typical, liberal-inclined sportswriter, furrowing his brow and (to use a slogan that got slapped on his foreign policy) “leading from behind.”Sports was the chief metaphor of the Obama White House.
During the 2014 midterms, when Democrats asked Obama to stay off the trail, an anonymous aidetoldTheNew York Times: “You’re in the Final Four, and you’re on the bench with a walking boot and you don’t get to play.”Obama, in turn,used the language of sports to describe himself.
He was Aaron Rodgers, he told Simmons, his eyes always trained downfield despite a messy pocket.
Teasing out his foreign policy at a stop in the Philippines, Obamasaid: “You hit singles, you hit doubles; every once in a while we may be able to hit a home run.”In 2014, Obamascoffedat the remnants of Al Qaeda that had outlived Osama bin Laden: “[I]f a JV team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant.” The metaphor wouldbecome notoriouswhen another terrorist group, ISIS, claimed tracts in Syria and Iraq.RelatedObama’s Biggest MistakeYet for every time he tried way too hard, Obama unlocked moments of pure joy only accessible to a genuine fan.
He was the first president to establish full diplomatic relations with the nation’s athletes, and the shit talk echoed back and forth between the locker room and the White House.Obamatoldsoccer player Tim Howard to shave his beard.
When the Miami Heat visited the White House, he knewthe right, slashing joketo make about Mario Chalmers.
LeBron James put his head on Dwyane Wade’s shoulder as he dissolved in laughter.)
Steph CurrysaidonEllenthat Obama talked trash while playing golf: “I’ll hit a shot out of bounds, and he’ll just look like, ‘Yeah, that’s not a good shot.
I’m going to need you to do better next time.’”Two years ago, Michael Jordan dismissed Obama as a “shitty” golfer.
Obamafired back: “There is no doubt that Michael is a better golfer than I am.
Of course, if I was playing twice a day for the last 15 years, then that might not be the case.”Obama added, “He might want to spend more time thinking about the Bobcats.”Here you can almost hear Obama’s internal editor stepping in —the sports-talk-host-in-chief has to be exact!“Or the Hornets,” he added.Charming anecdotes like these didn’t walk from the White House to the front page of the newspaper.
The endless reminders of Obama’s sports fandom made you realize that America wasn’t just eavesdropping on a man’s private passion.
If Obama was more sports-mad than any president, he alsousedsports more ruthlessly.
He made it into cold-blooded political tool.When I point this out to Obamaites, they often respond, “Oh, I think he really loves sports.” Well, sure.
And Bill Clinton really loved the saxophone.
But whenClinton played the sax onArsenio, it morphed from a hobby into a campaign prop.
This is exactly what happened with Obama and sports.Early in Obama’s presidency, stories leaked to reporters that painted a picture of a gonzo fan who somehow coped with being leader of the free world.
In a 2008 meeting, Obama was “sending urgent-looking BlackBerry messages back and forth” with Robert Gibbs, his first press secretary.
What was so important?
Obama,TheNew York Timesreported, was chatting with Gibbs about his fantasy team.InDouble Down, Halperin and Heilemann noted that Obama’s Treaty Room had a computer, printer, and “a TV for monitoring ESPN.” (Not CNN?
My favorite Obama set piece was staged on May 20, 2012, when Obama left a dinner with NATO allies to go to Chicago’s Soldier Field.
There, he picked up a football and cocked it in his left arm, while the perfectly positioned White House photographer, Pete Souza, snapped away.
On the White House website, the picture was selected as a “photo of the day.” Why?
Obama was running for re-election.
Throwing a football made him look really cool.It was a perfectly manipulative use of sports fandom.
It’s not unlike the times Michael Dukakis, during his 1988 campaign, grabbed a baseball glove and played catch on a tarmac in front of reporters.
As Joan DidionwroteinTheNew York Review of Books:There was more than a little willingness to accept spin — there was with Obama, too.Of course, Obama had good reasons to lay it on thick.
He spent his presidency being labeled The Other — a madrassa-educated, Kenyan-born, America-(god)damning socialist mole who would shred the Constitution.I oncewrotethat when Obama talks sports, he shows America his birth certificate.
I never figured that the man demanding the birth certificate would replace him.And it should be said that Obama’s sports campaign was wildly successful.He forged a bond with Rust Belt voters that Hillary Clinton couldn’t in 2016; for such a remote figure, Obama came off as more approachable than either of his opponents.
Other than convincing Americans he could be a transformative, cross-partisan force, convincing them he loved sports as madly and deeply as they did was Obama’s greatest act of salesmanship.
He showed more gusto talking sports than he ever did defending Obamacare.Outside of midwifing a new wave of athlete political awareness, Obama’s sports talk leaves no real intellectual legacy.
But it shows how genuine passion and political theater can converge until they become the same thing.
Back in 2012, when Obama recommitted himself to debate prep after his disastrous first encounter with Romney, David Axelrod was struck.
Here was a lifelong underdog ready to pull off another upset.
Obama was shooting like Paul Westphal; he was holding the goal line like the Rams.
As Axelrod laternoted, it was just like the ending ofHoosiers.Most ReadKevin Love Wants to Keep GoingA Hall of Fame career might be enough for some, but not for Love.

At 47, Obama regularly plays basketball and is an unabashed fan of the game.
How do his skills match up with the other 43 leaders of our country?
Here’s a look at our country’s most athletic presidents.10.
George W. BushThe one-time part owner of the Texas Rangers, Bush has showed off his throwing arm on numerous occasions in throwing out the first pitch at Major League ballgames.
Like his father, Bush played baseball at Yale and has also enjoyed running and cycling in his leisure time.9.
Abraham LincolnLincolnwas known as a pretty fair wrestler in his youth.
Most noteworthy was a wrestling match against Jack Armstrong in 1831 in New Salem.
Armstrong was considered the best fighter in the area, but several accounts of the match haveLincolnwinning handily.Lincolnwas also known for his strength reportedly carried a load of 600 pounds.8.
John F. KennedyKennedy was a swimmer at Harvard and won an intercollegiate sailing championship with his brother Joe.
He also played football and the family touch football games on the White House lawn were legendary during his term as president.7.
Jimmy CarterCarter was president in the late 1970s – right when the running craze hitAmerica.
A cross country runner in the service, Carter was often shown running for recreation during his White House days.
In high school in Plains,Ga., Carter was a standout in basketball and reportedly played baseball while serving in the Navy.6.
Ronald ReaganReagan may have been better known for portraying athletes in the movies than actually being an athlete.
He played George Gipp in the movie “Knute Rockne, All-American” and Grover Alexander in “The Winning Team.” Reagan graduated fromDixonHigh SchoolinIllinoiswhere he played sports.
According to Reagan, he was lifeguard and saved 77 lives in 1926.
He also reportedly played football atEurekaCollege.
Riding horseback and working on hisCaliforniaranch were some of the more physical activities he participated in during his two terms as president.5.
Barack ObamaThe newly-elected president has made no secret of his love for the game of basketball.
Often shown playing pickup games during his campaign, Obama is reported to have ledOccidentalCollegein scoring in 1979; however other reports list him as a member of the JV team, not the varsity.
Obama graduated fromPunahouHigh SchoolinHawaii, which has won 322 state championships, the most of any school in the nation.4.
Theodore RooseveltRooseveltwas a rugged outdoorsman who was known for his marksmanship.Rooseveltalso took boxing lessons as a youth and enjoyed the sport up until his presidency when he was injured in one eye and was forced to give up the sport.3.

1]She is the mother ofBarack Obama, the44th president of the United States.
Dunham was known as Stanley Ann Dunham through high school, then as Ann Dunham, Ann Obama, Ann Soetoro, a.k.a.
Ann Sutoro, and resumed her maiden name, Ann Dunham, later in life.
2]Born inWichita, Kansas, Dunham studied at theEast–West Centerand at theUniversity of Hawaiʻi at MānoainHonolulu, where she attained a bachelor of arts degree in anthropology (1967),[3]and later received master of arts (1974) and PhD (1992) degrees, also in anthropology.
4]She also attended theUniversity of WashingtoninSeattlefrom 1961 to 1962.
Interested in craftsmanship, weaving, and the role of women incottage industries, Dunham's research focused on women's work on the island ofJavaand blacksmithing in Indonesia.
To address the problem of poverty in rural villages, she createdmicrocreditprograms while working as a consultant for theUnited States Agency for International Development.

Janny Scott, an author and formerNew York Timesreporter, published a biography of her titledA Singular Womanin 2011.

5]In an interview, Barack Obama referred to his mother as "the dominant figure in my formative years ...
The values she taught me continue to be my touchstone when it comes to how I go about the world of politics.
6]Early life[edit]Dunham was born on November 29, 1942, at St. Francis Hospital inWichita, Kansas,[7]the only child ofMadelyn Lee PayneandStanley Armour Dunham.
8]She was of predominantly English ancestry, with some Scottish, Welsh, Irish,Germanand Swiss.
9]Wild Bill Hickokis her sixth cousin, five times removed.
10]Ancestry.comannounced on July 30, 2012, after using a combination of old documents andyDNAanalysis, that Dunham's mother was descended fromJohn Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in seventeenth-century colonialVirginia.
11][12]Her parents were born in Kansas and met in Wichita, where they married on May 5, 1940.
13]After theattack on Pearl Harbor, her father joined theUnited States Armyand her mother worked at aBoeingplant in Wichita.
14]According to Dunham, she was named after her father because he wanted a son, though her relatives doubt this story and her maternal uncle recalled that her mother named Dunham after her favorite actressBette Davis' character in the filmIn This Our Lifebecause she thought Stanley, as a girl's name, sounded sophisticated.
15]As a child and teenager she was known as Stanley.
2]Other children teased her about her name.
Nonetheless, she used it through high school, "apologizing for it each time she introduced herself in a new town.
16]By the time Dunham began attending college, she was known by her middle name, Ann, instead.
2]AfterWorld War II, Dunham's family moved from Wichita toCaliforniawhile her father attended theUniversity of California, Berkeley.
In 1948, they moved toPonca City, Oklahoma, and from there toVernon, Texas, and then toEl Dorado, Kansas.
17]In 1955, the family moved toSeattle,Washington, where her father was employed as a furniture salesman and her mother worked as vice president of a bank.
They lived in an apartment complex in theWedgwoodneighborhood where she attendedNathan Eckstein Junior High School.
18]In 1957, Dunham's family moved toMercer Island, anEastsidesuburb of Seattle.
Dunham's parents wanted their 13-year-old daughter to attend the newly openedMercer Island High School.
6]At the school, teachers Val Foubert and Jim Wichterman taught the importance of challenging social norms and questioning authority to the young Dunham, and she took the lessons to heart: "She felt she didn't need to date or marry or have children."
One classmate remembered her as "intellectually way more mature than we were and a little bit ahead of her time, in an off-center way",[6]and a high school friend described her as knowledgeable and progressive: "If you were concerned about something going wrong in the world, Stanley would know about it first.
We were liberals before we knew what liberals were."
Another called her "the original feminist".
6]She went through high school "reading beatnik poets and French existentialists".

Years later she discovered this was false.
21]Obama Sr.'s first wife, Kezia, later said she had granted her consent for him to marry a second wife in keeping withLuocustoms.
23]On August 4, 1961, at the age of 18, Dunham gave birth to her first child, Barack Obama, in Honolulu.

40]On August 9, 1992, she was awardedPhDinanthropologyfrom the University of Hawaii, under the supervision of Prof.Alice G. Dewey, with a 1,043-page dissertation[50]titledPeasant blacksmithing in Indonesia: surviving and thriving against all odds.
51]Anthropologist Michael Dove described the dissertation as "a classic, in-depth, on-the-ground anthropological study of a 1,200-year-old industry".
52]According to Dove, Dunham's dissertation challenged popular perceptions regarding economically and politically marginalized groups, and countered the notions that the roots of poverty lie with the poor themselves and that cultural differences are responsible for the gap between less-developed countries and the industrialized West.
52]According to Dove, Dunhamfound that the villagers she studied in Central Java had many of the same economic needs, beliefs and aspirations as the most capitalist of Westerners.
Village craftsmen were "keenly interested in profits", she wrote, and entrepreneurship was "in plentiful supply in rural Indonesia", having been "part of the traditional culture" there for a millennium.Based on these observations, Dr. Soetoro concluded that underdevelopment in these communities resulted from a scarcity of capital, the allocation of which was a matter of politics, not culture.
Antipoverty programs that ignored this reality had the potential, perversely, of exacerbating inequality because they would only reinforce the power of elites.
As she wrote in her dissertation, "many government programs inadvertently foster stratification by channeling resources through village officials", who then used the money to strengthen their own status further.
52]Dunham produced a large amount of professional papers that are held in collections of theNational Anthropological Archives(NAA).
Her daughter donated a collection of them that is categorized as theS.
Ann Dunham papers, 1965-2013.
This collection contains case studies, correspondence, field notebooks, lectures, photographs, reports, research files, research proposals, surveys, and floppy disks documenting her dissertation research on blacksmithing, as well as her professional work as a consultant for organizations such as the Ford Foundation and the Bank Raykat Indonesia (BRI).
They are housed at theSmithsonian National Museum of Natural History.Her field notes have been digitized and, in 2020,Smithsonian Magazinenoted that an effort had been established for a project to transcribe them.
53]Public participation in the transcription project was announced at the same time.Illness and death[edit]In late 1994, Dunham was living and working in Indonesia.
One night, during dinner at a friend's house in Jakarta, she experienced stomach pain.
A visit to a local physician led to an initial diagnosis of indigestion.
16]Dunham returned to the United States in early 1995 and was examined at theMemorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Centerin New York City and diagnosed withuterine cancer.
By this time, the cancer had spread to her ovaries.
21]She moved back to Hawaii to live near her widowed mother and died on November 7, 1995, 22 days short of her 53rd birthday.
54][55][34][56][57]Following a memorial service at the University of Hawaii, Obama and his sister spread their mother's ashes in the Pacific Ocean atLanai Lookouton the south side ofOahu.
34]Obama scattered the ashes of his grandmotherMadelyn Dunhamin the same spot on December 23, 2008, weeks after his election to the presidency.
58]Obama talked about Dunham's death in a 30-second campaign advertisement ("Mother") arguing for health care reform.
The ad featured a photograph of Dunham holding a young Obama in her arms as Obama talks about her last days worrying about expensive medical bills.
57]The topic also came up in a 2007 speech inSanta Barbara:[57]I remember my mother.
She was 52 years old when she died of ovarian cancer, and you know what she was thinking about in the last months of her life?
She wasn't thinking about getting well.
She wasn't thinking about coming to terms with her own mortality.
She had been diagnosed just as she was transitioning between jobs.
And she wasn't sure whether insurance was going to cover the medical expenses because they might consider this a preexisting condition.
I remember just being heartbroken, seeing her struggle through the paperwork and the medical bills and the insurance forms.
So, I have seen what it's like when somebody you love is suffering because of a broken health care system.
And it's wrong.
It's not who we are as a people.
57]Dunham's employer-provided health insurance covered most of the costs of her medical treatment, leaving her to pay the deductible and uncovered expenses, which came to several hundred dollars per month.
59]Her employer-provided disability insurance denied her claims for uncovered expenses because the insurance company said her cancer was apreexisting condition.
59]Posthumous interest[edit]In September 2008, theUniversity of Hawaii at Mānoaheld a symposium about Dunham.
60]In December 2009,Duke University Presspublished a version of Dunham's dissertation titledSurviving against the Odds: Village Industry in Indonesia.The book was revised and edited by Dunham's graduate advisor,Alice G. Dewey, and Nancy I. Cooper.
Dunham's daughter,Maya Soetoro-Ng, wrote the foreword for the book.
In his afterword,Boston Universityanthropologist Robert W. Hefner describes Dunham's research as "prescient" and her legacy as "relevant today for anthropology, Indonesian studies, and engaged scholarship".
61]The book was launched at the 2009 annual meeting of theAmerican Anthropological Associationin Philadelphia with a special Presidential Panel on Dunham's work; The 2009 meeting was taped byC-SPAN.
62]In 2009, an exhibition of Dunham's Javanesebatiktextile collection (A Lady Found a Culture in its Cloth: Barack Obama's Mother and Indonesian Batiks) toured six museums in the United States, finishing the tour at theTextile Museumof Washington, D.C., in August.
63]Early in her life, Dunham explored her interest in the textile arts as a weaver, creating wall hangings for her own enjoyment.
After moving to Indonesia, she was attracted to the striking textile art of the batik and began to collect a variety of different fabrics.
64]In December 2010 Dunham was awarded theBintang JasaUtama,Indonesia's highest civilian award; the Bintang Jasa is awarded at three levels, and is presented to those individuals who have made notable civic and cultural contributions.
65]A lengthy major biography of Dunham by formerNew York Timesreporter Janny Scott, titledA Singular Woman, was published in 2011.The University of Hawaii Foundation has established the Ann Dunham Soetoro Endowment, which supports a faculty position housed in the Anthropology Department at theUniversity of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, and the Ann Dunham Soetoro Graduate Fellowships, providing funding for students associated with theEast–West Center(EWC) inHonolulu, Hawaii.
5]In 2010 the Stanley Ann Dunham Scholarship was established for young women graduating from Mercer Island High School, Ann's alma mater.
In its first six years the scholarship fund has awarded eleven college scholarships.
66]On January 1, 2012, President Obama and his family visited an exhibition of his mother's anthropological work on display at theEast–West Center.
67]Filmmaker Vivian Norris's feature length biographical film of Ann Dunham entitledObama Mama(La mère d'Obama-French title) premiered on May 31, 2014, as part of the 40th annual Seattle International Film Festival, not far from where Dunham grew up on Mercer Island.
68]Personal beliefs[edit]In his 1995 memoirDreams from My Father, Barack Obama wrote, "My mother's confidence in needlepoint virtues depended on a faith I didn't possess...
In a land [Indonesia] where fatalism remained a necessary tool for enduring hardship ... she was a lonely witness forsecular humanism, a soldier forNew Deal,Peace Corps, position-paper liberalism.
69]In his 2006 bookThe Audacity of HopeObama wrote, "I was not raised in a religious household ... My mother's own experiences ... only reinforced this inherited skepticism.
Her memories of the Christians who populated her youth were not fond ones ... And yet for all her professed secularism, my mother was in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I've ever known.
70]"Religion for her was "just one of the many ways—and not necessarily the best way—that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives," Obama wrote.
71]She felt that somehow, wandering through uncharted territory, we might stumble upon something that will, in an instant, seem to represent who we are at the core.
That was very much her philosophy of life—to not be limited by fear or narrow definitions, to not build walls around ourselves and to do our best to find kinship and beauty in unexpected places.—Maya Soetoro-Ng[34]Dunham's best friend in high school, Maxine Box, said that Dunham "touted herself as an atheist, and it was something she'd read about and could argue.
She was always challenging and arguing and comparing.
She was already thinking about things that the rest of us hadn't.
6][72]On the other hand, Dunham's daughter, Maya Soetoro-Ng, when asked later if her mother was an atheist, said, "I wouldn't have called her an atheist.
She was an agnostic.
She basically gave us all the good books—the Bible, the HinduUpanishadsand theBuddhist scripture, theTao Te Ching—and wanted us to recognize that everyone has something beautiful to contribute.
33]"Jesus, she felt, was a wonderful example.
But she felt that a lot of Christians behaved in un-Christian ways.
71]In a 2007 speech, Obama contrasted the beliefs of his mother to those of her parents, and commented on her spirituality and skepticism: "My mother, whose parents were nonpracticing Baptists and Methodists, was one of the most spiritual souls I ever knew.
But she had a healthy skepticism of religion as an institution.
16]Obama also described his own beliefs in relation to the religious upbringing of his mother and father:My father was from Kenya and a lot of people in his village were Muslim.
He didn't practice Islam.
Truth is he wasn't very religious.
He met my mother.
My mother was a Christian from Kansas, and they married and then divorced.
I was raised by my mother.
So, I've always been a Christian.
The only connection I've had to Islam is that my grandfather on my father's side came from that country.
But I've never practiced Islam.

She was Stanley Ann Dunham at birth and Stanley Ann as a child, but dropped the Stanley upon graduating from high school.
She was Ann Dunham, then Ann Obama, then Ann Soetoro until her second divorce.
Then she kept her husband's name but modernized the spelling to Sutoro.
In the early 1980s, she was Ann Sutoro, Ann Dunham Sutoro, S. Ann Dunham Sutoro.
In conversation, Indonesians who worked with her in the late 1980s and early 1990s referred to her as Ann Dunham, putting the emphasis on the second syllable of the surname.
Toward the end of her life, she signed her dissertation S. Ann Dunham and official correspondence (Stanley) Ann Dunham.p.

Five Unordinary Facts About President Obama's Mother - ABC NewsABC NewsVideoLiveShowsGuns in AmericaInterest Successfully AddedWe'll notify you here with news aboutTurn on desktop notifications for breaking stories about interest?OffOnLOG INStream onFive Unordinary Facts About President Obama's MotherAnn Dunham was an unorthodox mother, to say the least.ByAMY BINGHAMMay 11, 2012, 5:37 PMMay 12, 2012 --intro: This Mother's Day, as Sasha and Malia Obama present their mom withhandmade giftsat the White House, the stark contrasts between President Obama's family now and his family as a child growing up in Hawaii could not be more apparent.Whereas the president and the first lady have been married for 20 years, his mother and father were married for four.
Throughout the first decade of his daughters' lives the family has lived in two cities, Chicago and Washington, D.C. By the time he was 10, Obama had lived in two countries.While Obama has put down the strongest of roots, his mother opted for wings, never staying in one place, let alone one country, for long.
I never imagined that an American president would have a mother who had done the things that she did," Janny Scott, who wrote a biography of Obama's mother, toldThe New York Times.And in her biography, "A Singular Woman," Scott quoted the president.
His mother had given him, he said, "a sense of unconditional love that was big enough that, with all the surface disturbances of our lives, it sustained me, entirely.
Here are five facts that make President Obama's mother no ordinary mom.quicklist:title:She lived in five states and three countriestext: Ann Dunham's family moved five times before Ann, or Stanley, as she was called in her childhood, turned 18, bouncing from Wichita, Kans., to California to Texas to Seattle and, finally, to Hawaii.As an adult Dunham adopted her parents' knack for nomadism, splitting most of her adult life between Hawaii and Indonesia, and briefly taking up residence in Pakistan, where she helped establish a microfinance program for women.Her son, on the other hand, took the opposite approach, putting down roots in Chicago and firmly planting himself and his family in the U.S."We've created stability for our kids in a way that my mom didn't do for us," Obama toldTime magazineduring his 2008 presidential campaign.
My choosing to put down roots in Chicago and marry a woman who is very rooted in one place probably indicates a desire for stability that maybe I was missing.
quicklist:title:Her first name is actually Stanleytext: President Obama's mother's full name is Stanley Ann Dunham.
Although she used her middle name for the majority of her adult life, Dunham went by Stanley throughout grade school, the name that her father, who wanted a son, gave her.Over the course of Dunham's short life -- she died when she was in her early 50s -- she went byfour different names.
Growing up it was Stanley Dunham.
In college she was Ann Dunham.
During her first marriage, to Barack Obama's father, she was Ann Obama.
And after her second marriage she was Ann Soetoro.quicklist:title: She was 18 when Barack Obama was borntext:President Obama's mother married his father at the ripe young age of 18, after the two met in a Russian-language class at the University of Hawaii.
At the time, interracial marriage was illegal in most states.Dunham was three months pregnant when the two tied the knot in a ceremony so discrete that her son never uncovered any records of the event, according toScott's biographyof Dunham, "A Singular Woman.
By the time Obama was a year old, his father, Barack Obama Sr., had moved from Hawaii to Massachusetts to get a masters degree from Harvard.
By the time he was six, he had moved with his mother to Indonesia after she married Lolo Soetoro.
The couple had a daughter, Maya Soetoro, before they divorced in 1980.quicklist:title: She was only five years older than Hillary Clintontext: Born in 1942, as World War II was ravaging the world, Obama's mother was a mere five years older than Hillary Clinton, whom he would later defeat in a bitter Democratic primary during his race for the White House.Dunham died a few weeks short of her 53rd birthday, of uterine and ovarian cancer, two years before her son was elected to the Illinois state senate.quicklist:title: She had a Ph.D. in anthropologytext: It may have taken her two decades and countless trips back-and-forth between Indonesia and the University of Hawaii to complete, but in 1992 Ann Dunham was awarded her Ph.D. inanthropology.Her 1,000-page dissertation explored the indigenous craft of blacksmithing in Indonesia, a topic she had studied for more than 20 years.
She died two years after completing it.She had instilled in her son the importance of education, making him rise before the sun came up to do his homework.
She would tell people that her son was gifted, "that he can do anything he ever wants in the world, even be president of the United States.

But biographer Janny Scott argues that those descriptions don't do justice to the president's mother — a complex, intellectual woman who led an "unconventional" life.NPRsubscribetoFresh AirpodcastNPR OneApple PodcastsSpotifyGoogle PodcastsAmazon MusicRSS linkAuthor InterviewsThe 'Singular Woman' Who Raised Barack ObamaFacebookFlipboardEmailMay 3, 201111:41 AM ETHeard onFresh AirThe 'Singular Woman' Who Raised Barack ObamaListen·34:1234:12Toggle more optionsDownloadEmbedEmbed<iframe src="https://www.npr.org/player/embed/135840068/135950317" width="100%" height="290" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" title="NPR embedded audio player">TranscriptA Singular Woman: The Untold Story of Barack Obama's MotherBy Janny ScottHardcover, 384 pagesRiverhead HardcoverList price: $26.95Read An ExcerptIn 1990, Barack Obama became the first African-American president of theHarvard Law Review.
A year later, he was approached by a literary agent, who asked if he would be interested in writing an autobiography about his life.Obama said yes, and in 1995, his bookDreams from My Fatherwas published.
As the title suggests, it focused mainly on the relationship he had with his father, Barack Obama Sr.
When articles about the book started coming out, they referred to his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, as simply "a white anthropologist from Kansas.
But the characterizations of Obama's mother — first as "a white anthropologist from Kansas" and then as "a single mother on food stamps" and "the woman who died of cancer while fighting with her insurance company at the end of her life" — don't encompass who she was, the unconventional life she led or the influence she had on the future president of the United States, says writer Janny Scott.Scott's biography of Obama's mother,A Singular Woman, traces Dunham's life and the relationship she had with her son, whose rise in the political world came largely after her death in 1995.
But he has said he largely thanks his mother for the values that led him to the work he now does.
He credits her with impressing upon him the importance upon one's duty to others — perhaps that the best thing that one can do is to give opportunities for others," Scott tellsFresh Air's Terry Gross.
And her work in many ways foreshadows his.
There was a period in 1979 where she was working in what her boss described to me as 'community development in Java.'
That's five years before he becomes a community development person in Chicago.

It was in Hawaii that she met a Kenyan student named Barack Obama.
Three months pregnant with their child, she married him in 1961.
Obama Sr. stayed in school in Hawaii, and Dunham returned to Seattle with her newborn baby, Barack.
She returned to Honolulu in 1963; she and Obama divorced in 1964.
In 1966, Dunham married Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian man studying in Honolulu on a student visa.Obama was largely raised in Hawaii for the first six years of his life, but in 1967, he moved to Indonesia with his mother to join Soetoro, who worked as a surveyor for the Indonesian government and then a consultant for Mobil.
Dunham taught English, worked in rural development and consulted on microfinance projects.
Obama attended local schools in Jakarta.
He also, at her insistence, took English correspondence classes and regularly woke up before dawn to go over his English language skills.
She believed that he deserved the kind of opportunities that she had had [like] the opportunity to a great university," Scott says.
And she believed that he would never get that if he didn't have a strong English-language education.
So at a certain point, she decided she wasn't serving his interests well by keeping him in Indonesia and in Indonesia schools.
Four years later, Obama moved back to Hawaii to live with his grandparents while his mother stayed in Indonesia with her second husband and daughter Maya Soetoro-Ng.
It was a complicated decision — and one that most people don't give her credit for, Scott says:"She was juggling a number of things: She wanted her son to get a good English-language education, which wasn't available to her in Indonesia.
She had an Indonesian daughter and an Indonesian husband at the time.
She needed to be able to work to pay for the education she wanted for her son and her daughter.
In order to work, she was going to need some kind of advanced degree.
So she was juggling a lot of things."
In 1972, Scott says, Dunham rejoined her son in Hawaii and stayed there during his middle school years.
She returned to Indonesia to do anthropological field work shortly after he entered high school.Enlarge this imageJanny Scott was a reporter forThe New York Timesfrom 1994 to 2008.Nina Subin/G.P.

PutnamObama decided not to return to Indonesia with his mother.
In 1985, she wrote a list of her long-range goals, which included "finish[ing] her dissertation, making a salary of 60K, los[ing] weight ... and having constructive dialogue with Barry" — a nickname used for the junior Barack Obama.Scott says she doesn't know of any problems between Obama and his mother, but there were some indications that his mother felt some sadness about the physical distance between them.
At different moments in her life she is upset, and at one point, in his senior year of high school in Hawaii, she goes back just to be with him because she realizes it's the last year of his childhood," she says.
Later, one friend describes her as wistful about his decision to move to Chicago and root himself in Chicago and emphasize the sort-of black part of himself.
So I think there was a theme — and this is just snippets of little things I've stumbled upon — that she had a kind of longing for a closer relationship with him.
Interview HighlightsOn her thoughts about articles written about Obama after he was elected president of theHarvard Law Review" 'His mother is a white woman from Kansas,' [or] 'His mother is an anthropologist,' or 'His mother is an anthropologist working in international development,' and that would be about it.
There were] long descriptions of his father's family history.
She went back to Indonesia during that period and confided to a friend how distraught and upset she was to be reduced to one sentence.
On interviewing President Obama for the book"I asked him about the [implication left] by his book that his mother was sort of a naive idealist — something that comes through in the way he talks and sometimes in the way other family members talk about her.
But that's not at all the description that I get from people who knew her as a colleague — close friends of hers.
No one has ever described her in that way to me.
Obama] said that he did think of her as a bit that way, but he didn't think of it as a pejorative.
He described those qualities as a source of her strength in many ways.
On the "birther" movement"The birther movement began during the campaign, when I was actually writing a series of biographical pieces forThe New York Timeson then-Senator Obama.
And then it kind of faded out a bit.
So during the period when I was doing the research, it wasn't something I was thinking a whole lot about ... and then was resuscitated by Donald Trump.
In the beginning, particularly because of speaking to so many people about President Obama's mother's life, and of course that covered his birth, I really had no question as to where he was born.
He was born in Hawaii.
When it became more and more pressing in recent months, I went back and looked at everything I had ever gathered on that subject.
... And it seemed so clear.
So I came to the conclusion that many people have come to — that this is a classic conspiracy theory, and it feeds on information that may well be to the contrary but is all taken to be evidence of the conspiracy.

 BARACK OBAMA, MARCH 18, 2008The photograph showed the son, but my eye gravitated toward the mother.
That first glimpse was surprising — the stout, pale-skinned woman in sturdy sandals, standing squarely a half­step ahead of the lithe, darker-skinned figure to her left.
His elas­tic-band body bespoke discipline, even asceticism.
Her form was well padded, territory ceded long ago to the pleasures of appetite and the forces of anatomical destiny.
He had the studied casualness of a catalog model, in khakis, at home in the viewfinder.
She met the camera head-on, dressed in hand-loomed textile dyed the color of indigo, a silver earring half hidden in the cascading curtain of her dark hair.
She carried her chin a few degrees higher than most.
His right hand rested on her shoulder, lightly.
The photograph, taken on a Manhattan rooftop in August 1987 and e-mailed to me twenty years later, was a revelation and a puzzle.
The man was Barack Obama at age twenty-six, the community organizer from Chicago on a visit to New York.
The woman was Stanley Ann Dunham, his mother.
It was impossible not to be struck forcefully by the similarities, and the dissimilarities, between them.
It was impossible not to question, in that moment, the stereotype to which she had been expediently reduced: the white woman from Kansas.The president's mother has served as any of a number of useful oversimplifications.
In the capsule version of Obama's life story, she is the white mother from Kansas coupled alliteratively with the black father from Kenya.
She is corn-fed, white-bread, whatever Kenya is not.
In Dreams from My Father, the memoir that helped power Obama's political ascent, she is the shy, small-town girl who falls head over heels for the brilliant, charismatic African who steals the show.
In the next chapter, she is the naive idealist, the innocent abroad.
In Obama's presidential campaign, she was the struggling single mother, the food stamp recipient, the victim of a health-care system gone awry, pleading with her insurance company for cover­age as her life slipped away.
And in the fevered imaginings of supermarket tabloids and the Internet, she is the atheist, the Marx­ist, the flower child, the mother who "abandoned" her son or duped the state of Hawaii into issuing a birth certificate for her Kenyan­born baby, on the off chance that he might want to be president someday.The earthy figure in the photograph did not fit any of those.
A few months after receiving the photo, I wrote an article for The New York Times about Dunham.
It was one in a series of bio­graphical articles on then Senator Obama that the Times published during the presidential campaign.
It was long for a newspaper but short for a life, yet people who read it were seized by her story and, some said, moved to tears.
As a result of the article, I was offered a chance to write a book on Dunham, and I spent two and a half years following her trail.
I drove across the Flint Hills of Kansas to the former oil boomtowns where her parents grew up during the Depression.
I spent many weeks in Hawaii, where she became pregnant at seventeen, married at eighteen, divorced and remar­ried at twenty-two.
I traveled twice to Indonesia, where she brought her son, at six, and from whence she sent him back, alone, at age ten, to her parents in Hawaii.
I visited dusty villages in Java where, as a young anthropologist, she did fieldwork for her Ph.D. disserta­tion on peasant blacksmithing.
I met with bankers in glass towers in Jakarta where, nearly two decades before Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank shared the Nobel Peace Prize for their work with microcredit, Dunham worked on the largest self-sustaining commercial microfinance program in the world.
I combed through tattered field notebooks, boxes of personal and professional papers, letters to friends, photo albums, the archives of the Ford Founda­tion in Midtown Manhattan, and the thousand-page thesis that took Dunham fifteen years to complete.
I interviewed nearly two hundred colleagues, friends, professors, employers, acquaintances, and relatives, including her two children.
Without their generosity, I could not have written this book.To describe Dunham as a white woman from Kansas is about as illuminating as describing her son as a politician who likes golf.
Intentionally or not, the label obscures an extraordinary story—of a girl with a boy's name who grew up in the years before the civil rights movement, the women's movement, the Vietnam War, and the Pill; who married an African at a time when nearly two dozen states still had laws against interracial marriage; who, at age twenty­-four, moved to Jakarta with her son in the waning days of an anti-communist bloodbath in which hundreds of thousands of Indonesians are believed to have been slaughtered; who lived more than half of her adult life in a place barely known to most Ameri­cans, in an ancient and complex culture, in a country with the larg­est Muslim population in the world; who spent years working in villages where an unmarried, Western woman was a rarity; who immersed herself in the study of a sacred craft long practiced ex­clusively by men; who, as a working and mostly single mother, brought up two biracial children; who adored her children and believed her son in particular had the potential to be great; who raised him to be, as he has put it jokingly, a combination of Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, and Harry Belafonte, then died at fifty-two, never knowing who or what he would become.
Had she lived, Dunham would have been sixty-six years old on January 20, 2009, when Barack Obama was sworn in as the forty­fourth president of the United States.FromA Singular Woman: The Untold Story of Barack Obama's MotherbyJanny Scott.

She was less than two years older than the president is now.
Her death from uterine cancer came between two key events in her son’s life.
Four months earlier “Dreams From My Father” had been published; it seemed destined to drown unnoticed in the deep ocean of books.
One year later Obama won his first election, to the Illinois state Senate, the initial stop on his swift journey to the White House that, along the way, brought a mass audience to that forgotten memoir, which in its best-selling revival defined his political image and provided him with lifelong financial security.The title of the book was at once understandable and misleading.
Obama barely knew his father except in dreams, or nightmares.
He spent time with the old man only once, when he was 10, for an unsatisfying month.
It is harsh to say but nonetheless likely that Barack Obama II was lucky never to have lived with Barack Obama Sr., an abusive alcoholic.
By far the most influential figures in Obama’s early life were his mother and grandmother.
He has some of the demeanor of his grandmother and the will and much of the outlook of his mother.
Dreams From My Mother” better evokes his life’s story.She was a woman of many names.
Born Stanley Ann Dunham, she assumed, as most people did, that her unusual first name was imposed by her father.
An uncle tells a different story, attributing the choice to Madelyn Dunham, Stanley Ann’s mother, who as a small-town Kansas girl yearned to emulate Bette Davis, the sophisticated actress she saw on the big screen at the air-conditioned Augusta Theater.
While Madelyn was pregnant, Davis was starring in a movie in which she played a female character named Stanley.
As it happened, no two people could have been less alike than Madelyn’s daughter and this film character, who was cruel, cunning and racist.)
Stanley Ann became Stannie Ann in grade school, Stanley in high school and, finally, Ann in adulthood.
Her last name changed as often, from Dunham to Obama to Soetoro to a final spelling of Sutoro.By any name, she was a searcher.
She married a Kenyan and an Indonesian (both marriages collapsed; the first quickly, the second slowly) and spent most of her adult life overseas.
She was constantly on the move.
She earned a doctorate in anthropology and had an anthropologist’s nature as a participant observer, a character trait shared by her son.
She was fascinated by other cultures and ways of living.
A polyglot, she could speak Bahasa Indonesia fluently and had a working knowledge of Urdu, Hindi, Javanese, French and Latin.
There was never a foreign film she did not want to see, a batik dress she did not want to wear, a mythology she did not wish to understand.
In Indonesia, where she spent most of her adult life, she became obsessed with the work of rural blacksmiths, who were said to forge human souls.
She devoted herself later to helping Javanese women maintain their handicraft livelihoods in a male-dominated society that practiced what she called “the gentle oppression” of women.
She would wake up before dawn every morning and, in notebooks with the black-and-white speckled covers, record her travels, her encounters and her hopes for people, including her only son.Barack Obama’s relationship with his mother was complicated.
She called him Barry or Bar (sounds like bear).
She pushed him to be serious and to look at people with empathy.
He always felt protective of her, according to his memoir.
He describes a scene in which she told him that she intended to marry Lolo Soetoro and that, after the marriage, they would all live in Indonesia.
As Obama recalls it, he turned to her and asked, “But do you love him?” — a question that made her chin tremble.
It was, at the least, precocious.
At the time he was only 31/2.
But it was also in keeping with one of the themes that weaves through his dealings with his mother over the years — that she was naive and idealistic, sometimes too good for her own good.
In the journal that his New York girlfriend, Genevieve Cook, kept during their time together in the early 1980s, Cook wrote, “Told me the other night of having pushed his mother away over past 2 years in an effort to extract himself from the role of supporting man in her life — she feels rejected and has withdrawn somewhat.”Ann once joked that she had children with a Kenyan and an Indonesian so that the kids would not have light skin and get sunburns.
She herself looked like a Kansas schoolmarm, she noted, which made it easy for her to sail through Customs during her foreign comings and goings.
Barry, thehapaKenyan, and his little sister Maya, thehapaIndonesian, could never say the same.
The mother and her two children struggled to find their identities, but in very different ways.
Ann found hers through her work and travels, a lifestyle that, among other things, meant she and her son were apart for most of his adolescence, he in Honolulu with his grandparents, she in Indonesia.
The search for identity was more psychological for her children, something that Maya said her mother must have understood but never fully acknowledged.
In her career, Ann was idealistic but not naive.
If she at times came across as naive to her children, it was in the role of a mother not wanting her children to suffer.“She made sure that laughter was the prevailing form of communication and that nothing ever became acrimonious and that everything was pretty and everything was sacred,” Maya told me during an interview.
Maybe she didn’t want us to suffer with identity.
She wanted us to think of it as a gift.
The fact that we were multilayered and multidimensional and multiracial — it meant that she was perhaps unprepared when we did struggle with issues of identity.
She was not really able to help us grapple with that in any nuanced way.
Perhaps she felt that if she did acknowledge the difficulty of it, she would feel guilty.”No guilt on Mother’s Day.
