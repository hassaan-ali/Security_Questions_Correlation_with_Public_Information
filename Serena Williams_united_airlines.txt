In a housetour forArchitectural Digest, Williams revealed this week that instead of a living room, her new home features a central art gallery for some of her favorite pieces.PlayIn terms of artistic tastes, Williams favors flashy pieces by bombastic art world favorites such as Leonardo Drew, David Kracov and Radcliffe Bailey. She also has a Kaws x Campana Brothers chair in the center of her gallery that’s made up of a clump of plush red Elmo toys. In theArchitectural Digestvideo, she also approaches a large piece by Radcliffe Bailey that features a genuine moon rock affixed to its materials. “Sometimes I feel like when I want to go to space I just touch that little guy, so that’s pretty amazing,” Williams explains.The tennis pro also shows off a set of doors from Nepal that stand in her gallery, as well as 3D artwork featuring paint and a needle that she’s made herself. Williams also notes that her gallery isn’t yet finished, and that she’s anticipating the arrival of pieces by artist Titus Kaphar. Finally, she shows off two feminine figurines by artist Brendan Marshall which Williams has chosen to represent herself and her sister, Venus. However, perhaps the funniest part of the video comes when Williams attempts to show off her trophy collection; it’s clear she isn’t even certain how many trophies she has, what they’re for and where they all are. When you’re this good, who needs to keep track?Filed Under:Arts,Visual Art,Leonardo Drew,David Kracov,Brendan Marshall,Radcliffe Bailey,Titus Kaphar,Architectural Digest,Alexis Ohanian,Serena Williams,Florida,United States,MiamiSEE ALSO:  Review: ‘Becky Nurse of Salem’ Rides a Witch Revival WaveContactAboutAdvertiseAdvertising GuidelinesEditorial EthicsSitemapNewslettersRSS FeedsPrivacyTermsCookie SettingsDo not sell my dataPowered byWordPress VIPWe noticed you're using an ad blocker.We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.But advertising revenue helps support our journalism.To read our full stories, please turn off your ad blocker.We'd really appreciate it.How Do I Whitelist Observer?How Do I Whitelist Observer?Below are steps you can take in order to whitelist Observer.com on your browser:For Adblock:Click the AdBlock button on your browser and selectDon't run on pages on this domain.For Adblock Plus on Google Chrome:Click the AdBlock Plus button on your browser and selectEnabled on this site.For Adblock Plus on Firefox:Click the AdBlock Plus button on your browser and selectDisable on Observer.com.Then Reload the Page

WILLIAMS: That's my little sister, guys.(LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Ladies and gentlemen, our champion, the legendary Serena Williams.(APPLAUSE)S. WILLIAMS: She's the only reason I'm standing here today and the only reason that the Williams sisters exist. So thank you, Venus, for inspiring me.(APPLAUSE)GARCIA-NAVARRO: Serena Williams beat her big sister, Venus, on Saturday to win the Australian Open. It's her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, a new record. In this week's edition of Out Of Bounds, our ongoing conversation about sports and culture, we talk with Clinton Yates. He's a writer for the ESPN website The Undefeated and penned an intensely personal essay about how he came to admit that Serena is his favorite athlete of all time.Thanks for coming here.CLINTON YATES: Anytime.GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to talk about this article which caught our eye. You wrote that it took you years to be able to say this out loud. Say it. What is it?YATES: Serena Williams is my favorite athlete of all time.GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK (laughter), tell us, why was it so hard for you, as a man, to admire a woman athlete?YATES: I think there's two reasons. No. 1, is that as somebody that grew up - you know, I played three sports in high school. I played soccer. I played basketball. I played baseball. So my entire, sort of, psychological link to what I cared about in sports was very much toward, No. 1, those sports and No. 2, people who I saw who I felt were better at team games.But I also think that too many athletes are so caught up, from an identity standpoint, in one thing or another thing - whether it's being a woman, whether it's being black or whether it's being someone who's not American. In this case, Serena obviously is American. But you know how sometimes there's something that you like and you keep returning to it and you don't really have a reason why? And then something happens and you're like - wow, I know a lot more about that than I cared to realize.And it was when she last won Wimbledon, and I just looked at myself, and I said - I don't know that there's another person I'd rather watch play sports. And that's all I do for a living, you know what I mean? And...GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was the moment for you?YATES: That was the moment for me. It was the last Wimbledon where I said - wow, not only is she my favorite athlete from a standpoint of playing the game, but I am here for the fashion. I am here for what she does off the court. I am here for her eloquence and intelligence and personal standards. The situation that happened at Indian Wells - she didn't play there for years because she felt it was a racist location, and she was not going to deal with that.GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to come back to this idea of you - obviously - as a man, making this admission about a woman athlete. What has been the reaction when you talked about this on Twitter, when you've talked about this publicly? What has been the reaction among other men?YATES: The first reaction I got to that was some guy said, I'm having a hard time imagining you wearing a tennis skirt, which instantly indicated to me where most people are at, from a guy's standpoint, when it comes to what they think about women. They are ultimately just objects of desire or of their gaze. So a lot of guys, for me, reacted - oh, come on, how could you say something like that? And it's like well, you know, sorry, dude - I don't look at all women as sex objects, No. 1. And No. 2, I don't view all things that women do in athletic context as lesser than.And that - those two things right there are more than most men are not only willing to do but need to do. That's the problem. You know, this is what toxic masculinity and patriarchy bring to you in society - is that if you don't have to do that, you will not do that. And so once I, you know, made that personal growth point, which was 10, 15 odd years ago, you know, it's not hard for me to say that.GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what did you think of the match?YATES: The grace that they showed toward each other, the actual competitiveness that they show on the court, it's really, really something to see. And if you haven't gotten a chance to watch it, it's worth watching the fullness of the match from entrance to exit, not just the part where they're hitting the tennis balls because their relationship is so special like that.GARCIA-NAVARRO: Clinton Yates is a writer for The Undefeated.

She now returns to the No. 1 spot after losing that ranking in September to Angelique Kerber.Despite an intense game in the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, the two sisters were all smiles and compliments in the post-match ceremony."There's no way I could be at 23 without her," Serena, 35, said of her sister. "Thank you Venus for inspiring me to be the best player I can be."The Two-WayNadal Books Date With Federer For Australian Open Title"Serena Williams. That's my little sister, guys," Venus said. "Your win has always been my win."The last time the two sisters faced off for the Australian Open was in 2003, which resulted in a win for Serena. She now has a 17-11 career record against Venus, which includes a record of 10-5 of Grand Slams, The Associated Press reports.With a combined age of 71, the sisters made up the oldest women's Grand Slam final. At 36, Venus was the oldest Grand Slam finalist in 23 years."I really elevated my game somehow," Serena told ESPN afterward, saying she still thinks she's in the prime of her career.

                                  as well as other partner offers and accept ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy.In order forSerena Williamsto juggle being a tennis icon, mother, founder of her own clothing line, and philanthropist, it's important for her to stay strong and fit.It's not an easy feat being one of the fastest-moving tennis players, so Williams has to be mindful ofthe exercises she routinely doesin order to maintain muscle while keeping her stamina up for long matches.Williams and her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, have even put together a workout routine made up ofagility work, cardio, and strength exercises.Although I'm far from being a pro athlete, I decided to try Williams' fitness regimen myself. After a bit of research, I devised a seven-day plan so I knew exactly which of her' exercises I would be doing each day.Here's what it was like working out like tennis pro Serena Williams for a week:Day one: I began Williams' workout by doing sprints and bodyweight exercises.The sprints were just the beginning of my day-one routine.Fabiana Buontempo for InsiderAlthough I felt pretty confident going into this week of workouts, I knew itwasn't going to be easy on my body.I began the day with sprints up and down my driveway to get my cardio in as Williams would, even though I'mnot a huge fan of running.Mouratoglou toldShape magazinethat he trains Williams on speed, not distance since she doesn't have to go very far on the tennis court. Mouratogloualso saidthat Williams sprints 50 meters at a time so she can move fast without running out of steam on the court.In true Williams fashion, I did my best and by the fifth sprint, I was dripping in sweat and ready to lay down on my front yard to catch my breath.According to herInstagram, Williams is a fan of bodyweight exercises, so I also did a circuit of moves that worked my entire body.I did three sets of 10 shoulder taps, split squats to leg kicks, mountain climbers, and crunches. At the end of the workout, I was sweaty and tired but I felt strong and proud of what I accomplished in day one.Day two: My abs were in pain after doing Williams' core routine.I started my day with some cardio on an elliptical.Fabiana Buontempo for InsiderThere's no denying that Williams has incredible abs, so I was excited to try hercore routinetoday. First, though, I wanted to start with some cardio.Williams toldFitness magazine, per Refinery29, that she likes to constantly change things up so she doesn't do the same form of cardio all the time.I don't regularly use the elliptical, so it felt like a good choice for me to switch up my routine, too. I ended up using the machine for 20 minutes.After breaking a sweat, I rolled out my mat for the core workout.I was exhausted after working on my core for less than an hour.Fabiana Buontempo for InsiderTo work her abs, Williams does a combination of bicycle crunches, leg crunches, front and side planks, and planks with hip dips.I decided to do 30 seconds of each exercise for four rounds. These simple exercises were very effectivefor making my abs burn.Day three: I started my routine with a brutal leg workout.I used 10-pound dumbbells in my routine.Fabiana Buontempo for InsiderI started the day by warming up my muscles before diving into a leg workout.When Williams works on herlegs, her trainer gives her specific moves that help keep her knees in great shape, which is key to balance out all of the tennis playing. Mouratoglou toldShapethat he has her focus on simple exercises that strengthen the muscles surround her knee joints.This intrigued me because my knees are pretty bad after my years of being a dancer, and sometimes leg-focused workouts make me nervous that I'll further put a strain on them.Since Williams does a combination of lunges, step-ups, front squats, and leg extensions, I grabbed my 10-pound dumbbells and attempted the same.For these moves, I made sure to really take my time and focus on my form.My legs were shaking by the end of this workout.Fabiana Buontempo for InsiderI did my best to get through three sets of 12 reps for each exercise. By the second set, I had to take breaks toshake out my legs.Despitemoving slowly through each exercise,I was still breathing heavily and had to keep my towel nearby to wipe the sweat out of my eyes.Once this leg routine was completed, I cooled down and stretched. Although I work out my legs fairly often, these specific exercises with low weight definitely shocked my muscles a bit and were more challenging than expected.Day four: Williams' short but brutal bodyweight routine left me in pain.Serena Williams' 15-minute workout left me exhausted.Fabiana Buontempo for InsiderAs expected, I woke up with sore legs — but I still hopped out of bed and immediately put on my workout clothes for today's moves.On the Nike Training Club app, Williams has her own 15-minuteworkoutthat you can download and follow. I was intrigued when I heard it was only 15 minutes, but knowing how hard Williams trains, I knew this workout was still going to put me through the wringer.The workout began with a warm-up that consisted of exercises such as squats and A-Skips, which are very fast-paced skips. After just a few minutes, I was already taking a sip of water, trying to catch my breath.I pushed myself to finish the workout strong.I struggled through the moves, but I didn't give up.Fabiana Buontempo for InsiderFrom there, the app led me through a series of bodyweight exercises. The transition from one exercise to the other was fast, leaving me little time to rest.I did lunges, lateral shuffles, and side-plank knee drives, which were so tough I had to bring my leg down a few times and just hold a side plank.From there I did renegade rows, which worked my back,push-ups, and burpees. The 15 minutes flew by and I was so thankful it was a quick workout.I struggled a bit through this routine, but I was proud of myself for keeping up with the intense moves and not giving up.Day five: My lungs and upper body burned from today's pool workout.Exercising in the pool was beyond my comfort zone.Fabiana Buontempo for InsiderAt this point in the week, I was amazed at all of the different ways athletes train in order to be in tip-top shape for their sport. Williams lifts weights and works on her speed — and she also works to strengthen her lungsby swimming.I'm lucky to have a pool in my backyard so I was able to follow in the tennis pro's footsteps and take today's workout outside.I don't often exercise in water, so I knew this would be a challenge for me. I gave myself a pep talk before attempting to do five laps back and forth across the pool with my head underwater.After each individual lap, I took a few breaths once I reached the wall and allowed my heart rate to come down a bit. Not only were my lungs getting a workout, but also I started feeling a burn in my arms and shoulders.I completed five laps and then rewarded myself with a back float around the pool.I empathized with Serena feelinglike she was "going to drown"during her pool workouts because my lungs were definitely burning from this.Day six: Williams' full-body circuit was one of the most challenging workouts so far.Part of Serena Williams' routine includes a ladder. I used a mat instead.Fabiana Buontempo for InsiderSurprisingly, I woke up excited for today's workout. This challenge was soon coming to an end and I felt strong from the moves I'd completed so far. I was even starting to see some definition in my arms and abs.For day six, I found a full-body circuit on Williams'Instagram.She used a ladder to work on her hops, jumping jacks, and footwork.I didn't have a ladder so I used a mat to replicate the circuit and did each move for 45 seconds.The full-body workout continued with bodyweight exercises.This was the toughest workout I did this week but I felt good for completing it.Fabiana Buontempo for InsiderIn the same video, Williams did an exercise that looked likeweighted squat jumpswith a heel click, plank hip dips, a standing ab exercise with a resistance band, bicycle crunches with a band around her ankles, regular crunches, mountain climbers, and shoulder taps.I couldn't believe how many exercises Williams did inone workout session.I forced myself to get through the seven exercises. I continued using a timer for this portion of the workout but instead of 45 seconds for each exercise, I did 30. I repeated this sequence three times each with a lot of water breaks in between.Although my body felt like jelly at the end of this workout, I noticed thatmy stamina had definitelyincreased from all of the high-impact workouts I'd been doing.Day seven: Every routine this week worked my entire body from head to toe so I wanted to end this challenge on a fun note.I did a workout from 305 Fitness, which left me feeling great.305 Fitness/YouTubeIt was a long week of workouts and although I was continuously sore,I felt strong and a little more confidentwith how my body looked. That said, I wanted to end the week on a high note.Williams once toldFitness magazine, per Refinery29,that when she was sick once and couldn't train like usual, she turned toward dance. Now, she said, she'll run for 10 minutes and then dance.I decided I'd do the same for my last workout. After a quick run, I followed along to a dance-cardio workout video from the305 Fitness YouTube channel.This workout was exactly what my sore muscles needed. It was fun to just shut my brain off and dance around like no one was watching. I felt satisfied with myself for completing this challenge.I felt strong and more confident after this week. I also think Williams' routine would be pretty doable for the average person.Serena Williams' routine was challenging but surprisingly doable.Scott Barbour/Stringer/Getty ImagesThis week of trying Williams' routine was the first time I attempted an athlete's workout regimen.Much to my surprise, a lot of the exercises Williams does wereones I was already familiar with.I also appreciated the reasoning behind some of her moves, which are designed to help her perfect her craft and avoid injuries. However, sprinting up and down my driveway and doing laps to strengthen my lungs were two of my least favorite workouts.I also think those two exercises could be tricky for the average person if they don't have the space for sprints or access to a pool.Overall, I really enjoyed this week of workoutsthat left me sore and sweaty. I think anyone can learn a few things from Williams and incorporate her workouts into their already established routine.Read More:13 of Serena Williams' most memorable tennis outfits of all timeI tried working out like Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle for two weeks, and found Markle has the better routineI worked out like Britney Spears for a week and my abs have never felt so soreI worked out like Beyoncé for a week, and I fell on my face, almost threw up, and have never felt more sore in my lifeRead nextFeaturesFreelancerEvergreen storyMore...Close iconTwo crossed lines that form an 'X'.

If I was pressed to name one over all others it would be French Horn. The sound of the instrument is so beautiful and varied. It can sound noble, defeated, utterly lonely and forlorn, heroic, soft and soothing, blaringly frightening and harsh. I know many instruments express emotions as well as french horn but the round sound it makes (that is the best way to describe it) is just absolutely beautiful.If I had time I would complement each instrument in the symphony orchestra and few more but for the sake of space and nerves I leave it at french horn.Link to commentShare on other sitesMore sharing options...John McClane1PostedJanuary 23, 2006John McClaneThe Die HardestGroup:MembersJoined:January 31, 2004Posts:4206Reputation:1Active:May 13, 2019Location:Mêlée IslandSharePostedJanuary 23, 2006French Horn(that's what Williams calls it anyways)Indeed, I tend to trust much more John Williams himself that that memeber here (probably someone who dislike France?)Link to commentShare on other sitesMore sharing options...ashinyobject0PostedJanuary 23, 2006ashinyobjectRegular PosterGroup:MembersJoined:April 8, 2005Posts:451Reputation:0Active:October 4, 2015Location:Talladega, Alabama, USofA, North AmericaSharePostedJanuary 23, 2006Freedom Horn.Link to commentShare on other sitesMore sharing options...Salacius7PostedJanuary 23, 2006SalaciusRegular PosterGroup:MembersJoined:January 4, 2006Posts:697Reputation:7Active:August 3, 2013SharePostedJanuary 23, 2006Have to say the solo in Always made me fall in love with the French Horn, it's just fantastic (I think it was James Thacher?)Also the intro to Arlington from JFK is awesome.From that to the powerful trills and glissandi Goldenthal writesNumero 1 for me!Link to commentShare on other sitesMore sharing options...Joni Wiljami1168PostedJanuary 23, 2006Joni WiljamiVeteranGroup:MembersJoined:October 16, 2005Posts:6442Reputation:1168Active:3 hours agoSharePostedJanuary 23, 2006Almost everyone's favorite instrument here seems to be the French Horn.Cool!...and the solo in Always is quite a challenge(Thacher it is...also well played in"collaboration"-cd)Link to commentShare on other sitesMore sharing options...Greg11383PostedJanuary 23, 2006Greg1138Down Once More...Group:MembersJoined:September 26, 2004Posts:3650Reputation:3Active:October 18, 2020Location:Gloucester, UKSharePostedJanuary 23, 2006Trumpet.....but a well-played Violin is also a joy to hear.....Link to commentShare on other sitesMore sharing options...Joe Brausam211PostedJanuary 23, 2006Joe BrausamA horn player.Group:MembersJoined:May 28, 2005Posts:3453Reputation:211Active:March 28Location:NJ, USASharePostedJanuary 23, 2006Well French Horn is the common name but Horn in F is the official name, as decided by the IHS (International Horn Society).

Read ourprivacy noticeIt is just as well that Serena Williams does not play tennis the way she writes television scripts or plays the guitar. On the court the American is the ultimate competitor, a fighter to the death. Off the court she gives the impression of a half-hearted dabbler without the commitment to see a project through.Williams admits she has a "remarkable ability to waste time" and can idle away hours surfing the internet. She has tried her hand at fashion designing and acting and now wants to write. She has plans for a "dramedy", mixing comedy and drama. Sister Venus has even bought her a book called Writing a TV Drama Series.There is only one problem. "In my mind I've been saying I want to write, but I haven't actually physically picked up a pencil and started writing," Serena confessed recently. "That is my next challenge, to actually sit down and do it. I don't know why I haven't started it yet. I have these unbelievable dreams. I need to write about them. I need to write an episode in this 'dramedy' to get them in. I've got the book on how to write it. I've been reading the book so maybe I now have just to start writing it."It is much the same with her collection of Stratocaster guitars. "I have five guitars, all Strats – I love Strats," Williams said. "I have one in baby blue, two blacks, one red, one wood-coloured." So how often does she play? "Not often, not as much as I used to. I used to have an acoustic, which I played more. But with my long nails now it's impossible to play my guitar. I won't cut my nails."I used to always jam with some other people in a band. We could never find a drummer, but we used to jam together. Venus played the bass, I'd play the guitar. Sometimes I'd play the bass, she'd play the guitar. We played lots of rock music, punk. Venus did more alternative stuff. It was fun."Nowadays Williams tends only to listen, either on her iPod – provided she can find it – or on her computer. "I lose my iPod every day," she said. "I don't have one at the moment because I lost it, just after I had bought it. On a plane I probably read and watch movies more than listen to music. I mostly listen to music in my room. If I'm just relaxing I have the music playing. I play it on the sound system on my HP computer."Music is important to me. It just takes you to a different place. I've read that Michael Phelps listens to music every day to get himself abbed up. Most players listen to music before they go out on the court."Does she use music before matches? "It depends. I did it one year and I didn't do it another year. I think that was because I lost and then I got mad. I obviously do it when I'm working out. I have my MP3 player. I use it to warm up. Sometimes I do dances before a match."What would she listen to before a match? "I have a playlist. I listen to some songs that keep me motivated, keep me abbed up. One is a Green Day song. I also listen to some Beyoncé. She seems to be so abbed with her music. I listen to a lot of hip-hop."As she prepares for her 10th Wimbledon, starting tomorrow, Williams might wonder whether to add Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive" to her playlist. The 16 seeds in Williams' debut year at Wimbledon in 1998 included Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Jana Novotna and Anna Kournikova, while only two of the seeds, Venus Williams and Patty Schnyder, are still playing today.Three years ago, when Serena missed the French Open and Wimbledon, there was speculation about her own future. Even when she won the 2007 Australian Open she was clearly short of her best physical shape, having played just five tournaments in the previous 16 months.At 27, however, she has just enjoyed her most successful 12 months since 2003, when she completed the "Serena Slam" – holding all four Grand Slam titles at the same time. Reaching last year's Wimbledon final was the start of a run that saw her win the US and Australian Open titles and regain the world No1 ranking she had last held five years previously. She has 10 Grand Slam titles and she is hungry for more.Serena needs hard work to stay in shape. She thinks she has never been fitter than this year, thanks in part to her winter training. "I was in Florida and a little bored – a big change from LA," she said. "I just trained with Venus [pictured with Serena, above] and my Dad in Florida. I practised a little more than I normally do. Florida's a little boring. There's nothing to do there. Every day I felt like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. I couldn't wait to get to Australia. Maybe that's why I won: because I didn't want to go back."It was a lot more focused for me in Florida. I'm on a great regime now – in LA as well. And being around Venus and seeing her work hard makes me want to do better and work harder. I have to work hard. I'm lazy. But the older I'm getting the more I'm enjoying hard work. I've realised that my job is to stay fit – and that's a pretty good job to have. I'm not a natural-born person who wants to go to the gym. That's not me."Does Venus bully her into working harder? "No, she just always says: 'Well, I did this, this and this.' It makes me want to say: 'Well, I did this, this, this and this.' So it was good. We were able to motivate each other."For years the sisters seemed to hate playing each other. Their matches were often poor and there were suggestions – strenuously denied – that they took it in turns to win. Over the years, however, their contests have become gripping. Last year's Wimbledon final, which Venus won 7-5 6-4, was memorable, while their US Open quarter-final, which Serena won 7-6 7-6, was arguably the best women's match of the year, full of wonderful athleticism and ball-striking."I think our matches have got a little better," Serena said. "We've got better as well, so that has made the quality of the match better, and our games have got closer. At one point she was dominating me and then I was winning. Now we're really neck and neck [they have won 10 matches each]. I think that has something to do with it as well."As for her own game, she believes she is a more complete player. How would the 2009 Serena fare against the 2003 version? "I think the Serena now would definitely beat the other Serena. I'm older. I think I'm wiser, a more mature player. Back then, it was more nitty-gritty. Now it's more composed and planned-out playing."Serena's recapturing of the world No 1 position – which she has since relinquished to Dinara Safina – was remarkable considering her comparative lack of success on the Sony Ericsson Tour. In almost five years, she has won just four tournaments away from the Grand Slam events. Safina has won six in the last 13 months alone – but has lost three Grand Slam finals along the way.After the Russian became world No 1 earlier this year, Serena was dismissive. "We all know who the real No 1 is," she said. "Quite frankly, I'm the best in the world."She insists, nevertheless, that losing the top spot is no big deal. "It's cool to be No 1, but everyone assumes I'm No 1 anyway," she said. "When I'm at home people come up to me and say: 'You're No 1.' I hadn't been No 1 for ever, but I never corrected them. I just let them assume."It's important, I guess, but at the same time I don't worry about it. I just take things as they go every day. If I'm No 1, great, if not I just try to keep winning the tournaments. It's hard these days to be No 1. You get to the finals of three Grand Slams in a row and you're still barely No 1."Serena concentrates on the Grand Slam tournaments. The Tour have tried to construct a calendar in which the top women all play at certain events, with fines for those who do not turn up, but appearing on court and winning matches are two different matters. Serena has fallen at the first hurdle in her last three tournaments outside the majors, losing to Klara Zakopalova, Schnyder and Francesca Schiavone.In Madrid she retired after one set against Schiavone, having arrived with a knee injury. Asked at a press conference if she would have been better advised to stay away and pay the $75,000 (£46,000) fine she feared, Serena replied: "Do you want to pay it for me? I'm remodelling a house. I don't know about anyone else, but $75,000 is a lot of money to me. That's like my whole furniture bill, some stairs, rugs. That can go a long way. In this economy I'm not in a position to just write out $75,000 cheques."Provided she remains fit, she plans to be around for a while yet. "I just feel like I'm going to play and keep playing," she said. "Right now I don't see an end. Today I actually enjoyed practising for the first time ever. I hate practising. I thought: 'Oh my God, the older I get the more forehands I want to hit.' So I think that's a good sign."And her ambitions for Wimbledon after finishing as runner-up 12 months ago? "My goal is just to do better than last year."Serena's possible path to finalRound 1Neuza Silva (Portugal) Age: 26.

No, scratch that. Shelooooooveskaraoke. She will throw down, any time or any place. She will groove to the music in between stanzas. She will belt out every single word and doesn't care if you film her because she is having a damn good time and don't you wish you were as alive as she is on stage.WatchRudy Gobert punches Kyle Anderson, remains waste of money | Andy ReactsCCShareSubtitlesOffEnglishShare this VideoFacebookTwitterEmailRedditLinkview videoRudy Gobert punches Kyle Anderson, remains waste of money | Andy ReactsWe microdosed Aaron Rodgers' darkness retreat8 hours agoSomething is wrong with the Knicks | Keep it a Buck(et)Friday 11:17AMNow, we have the Serena Williams karaoke collection.We'll start with the video above, Williams's take on the Marilyn Monroe classic "Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend" performed at a recent karaoke event in New York City. Don't be fooled by her charm and ease. Williams nails it because she's been working on her karaoke game for years.AdvertisementWilliams will work solo or with friends. Here she is with Victoria Azarenka and Redfoo performing "Party Rock Anthem."OK, that was an easy one, but Williams is a karaoke vet. Check out her skills on display in this rendition of Bon Jovi's "Always." Williams is on her knees, pouring over the microphone, gushing with emotion during the big chorus. Williams is so focused, she doesn't seem to notice the guy saying, "This is the raddest thing I've seen in, like, a month."44% offRoc Inflatable SUP Paddle Board BundleSummer's a' comin'Comes with everything you need like the pump and a separate waterproof dry bag to keep your valuables in like your keys or phone while on the waterBuy for$225at AmazonAdvertisementAdvertisementLike in tennis, Williams brings it all to her karaoke game.Williams doesn't just go for the obvious songs. Like a seasoned vet, she thinks about her karaoke choices.Advertisement"The thing about karaoke is picking a song that works for your voice," shetoldThe Associated Press, "that way if you sing like a cat—like I do—you can still sound pretty good."Perhaps that factored into her choice of Macy Gray's "I Try" when singing with Martina Hingis.But no karaoke canon is complete without "I Will Survive." It is the ultimate test of karaoke warriors' merits. Can they put their own take on the classic? Williams does not disappoint.Now, it all makes sense. Of course it was Williams whopartied with Caroline Wozniackisoon after Rory McIlroy called off the engagement. She knows we've all only got one life and, damn, is she living it.

My sister Venus also wears it — I assume for the same reasons. We share makeup tips and product suggestions sometimes, but my former physiotherapist Esther Lee actually first introduced me to this a few years ago.$15at AmazonBuy$7at WalmartBuyKing James Version Bible$5$5I try to read the Bible daily — usually first thing in the morning. If I’m driving, I’ll listen to scriptures onAudible. It’s also something I’ve tried to implement in my daughter Olympia’s life from infancy. Religion is a personal decision that everyone has to make on their own, but I make sure she knows principles from the Bible and how to live her best, most respectful life. I have specific passages that I turn to if I need inspiration or wisdom. Right now, I know a lot of people are feeling the pressures of the times that we are living in. In moments I feel overwhelmed, I like to remind myself of Matthew 6:30–34. I focus on verse 33, where we are reminded to keep seeking the kingdom when you feel anxious about the future. It really helps me calm down.$5at BookshopBuyBobbi Brown Skin Foundation Stick$47I do my makeup really fast every morning because I’m always in a rush. I’m no pro, but it’s been fun to learn new techniques from watching my favorite makeup artists over the years. In the past, I’ve always had to mix differentfoundation colorsto find my perfect match, but this product does a really good job matching my skin all on its own. I can just use one shade instead of two or three.$47at SephoraBuyApple iPhoneFrom

But in my defense, the first screen I look at in the morning is ourbaby camera, to see if Olympia is awake yet, then I pick up my phone. I use it for all the basic things: checking email, texting, social media. But I also do research for my fashion line on my phone. I create so many different mood boards for upcoming collections and find inspiration via so many different avenues. Doing it on myphoneallows me to collaborate with my team so we can bounce ideas off each other throughout the day.From

Another reason I love thelipstickis because it’s long-lasting — I often forget I have it on because of how natural it feels.

It’s just two months after the tennis titans went toe to toe at the Top Seed Open in Kentucky, which was their first time back on the court since the forced hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The world-famous pair, who have played many roles in each other’s lives in the 23 years since their first match against each other—best friends, former teammates, competitors, and longtime roommates—are giggling as they reflect on the five-year journey of collaborating on their greatest joint effort yet: designing Serena’s dream home.After co-owning a Palm Beach Gardens property where the Grand Slam duo lived together on and off since 1998, with Serena splitting her time between secondary homes from Bel-Air to Paris, she purchased a sprawling waterfront property of her own, with breathtaking views in a coveted enclave north of Miami, just minutes away from Venus and their parents. To help make the house ideal for her own family, naturally she turned to V Starr, Venus’s world-class design firm.A grouping of pendant lamps byTom Dixon(brass) andSimon Legald for Normann Copenhagen(Glass) sets the tone in the dining room. Artwork by Serena Williams.Lelanie FosterThe Sérénade Karaoke room features a bespoke neon sign designed by V Starr. Wall covering byPhillip Jeffries; custom Banquette and Fama chairs in aBrentanovelvet.Lelanie Foster“I was moving away from Venus for the first time in my life, so I wanted it to be really meaningful,” Serena says. While mixing family with business can be risky, the secret to their success as siblings and creative collaborators is simple: “You have to know your lane. I’m really good at playing tennis; I’m not as good at interiors. But I was able to learn through just watching Venus.”As with any other client, Venus says, her priority was catering to Serena’s vision—which did a complete 180 during the design process. After she purchased the 14,500-square-foot Spanish Mediterranean–style home, Serena’s traditional tastes suddenly felt out of step with this new phase of life. She credits her love of modern art and technology for ushering in a more modern, minimalist aesthetic. Then, of course, there was the burgeoning romance with tech tycoon Alexis Ohanian. The high-profile couple had only recently begun dating just after Serena embarked upon this massive real estate project, but Sonya Haffey, principal of V Starr, says Serena’s future family goals were an integral part of the design plans all along.Last July—after three years, including a gut renovation—Serena finally moved into the completely reimagined, ultra-modern, intracoastal property with a husband and toddler in tow. As the old adage goes, “If you build it, they will come.” Though, they all maintain, it was mostly Serena’s singular imagination—with guidance from V Starr—that spearheaded the design.RHpendant lights hang above a trapezoidal table.Officine Gulloappliances; Brizo sink fittings;Caesarstonecountertop.Lelanie FosterAVictoria + Alberttub stands in the bath.Brizotub and Shower fittings.

That would’ve been kind of creepy,” Venus chimes in.While Ohanian played the easygoing, supporting role to Serena’s more hands-on approach, one space the doting dad took the lead on perfecting was their three-year-old daughter’s bedroom. Both parents agree the pièce de résistance of their entire home is Olympia’s pink custom-designed castle bed complete with a built-in slide and an equally spectacular, one-of-a-kind chandelier created by blown-glass artist Josh Fradis. Indeed, it is positively fit for a princess.“She goes down the slide every night while we’re thinking, Man, we shouldn’t have done that, because now at bedtime, she just wants to slide,” Serena admits. “But whatever makes her happy makes me happy.”While Olympia’s room is decidedly the most extravagant space in the house, Serena insisted on exercising a bit more restraint in other areas. The marriage of sleek, clean lines and high-end features with warm woods and casual touches that complement Serena’s laid-back vibe resulted in a cohesive visual narrative that embodies Serena’s newly evolved design aesthetic, which Haffey calls “livable luxury,” adding that the client was a well of creativity, serving up references from hotels she’s stayed at all over the world.Art on display in the gallery includes works by (from left) Leonardo drew, Radcliffe Bailey, and David Kracov, as well as a Kaws x Campana chair, a live-edge wood bench, a piece from the Konyak Naga tribe of India, and a Vintage Wurlitzer piano. Floors are wide plank European Oak byHakwood.Lelanie Foster“Serena is not formal,” Venus notes. “She’s fun-loving; she’s very free, and not someone who wants to sit in a chair and serve someone tea. So it had to be a very welcoming space.”At Serena’s request, the V Starr team came up with an out-of-the-box design solution to refashion what was once a classical Floridian-style foyer and formal sitting room with beautiful chairs no one sat in, into a colorful art space with eccentric pieces on display. “When you walk in, it’s like walking into an art gallery,” says Serena. “That’s my favorite part of the house. It’s so unique. I’ve never seen anything like it.”Venus adds: “I am not a fan of just having spaces to have them. Maybe some people use their formal living rooms, but we don’t. So we created a space that she can actually use and enjoy and live with the art, and invite other people to absorb it and have that emotional connection as soon as you walk in. It sets the tone for the rest of the home.”Williams, poolside in Gucci and Serena Williams jewelry. The terrace is clad in White Falda porcelain tile. Landscape design by Lucido & Assoc.

Among the many standout features of the home are heated floors in the bathrooms, a sauna in the gym, a wine cellar the size of a small NYC apartment, an expansive terrace offering indoor/outdoor living spaces that overlooks an infinity pool complete with submerged chaise longues, Serena’s 620-square-foot closet fashioned after a luxe retail space, and a private trophy room to house the superstar athlete’s many awards. But there is one amenity that’s noticeably absent: a tennis court.“I wanted to separate home from work,” Serena says. “I love being home. When you have our job, you never get time to relax. So it’s good for me to be able to sit still and not do anything.”Moving into your dream home during a global pandemic no doubt has its challenges, but for this jet-setting athlete and mogul, being unexpectedly homebound for months has offered a welcome reprieve. The perks include ample quality time nesting with her young family, and a chance to hone her cooking chops. To that end, nailing the kitchen design was of supreme importance to Serena, who is the self-proclaimed cook of the family. The remit: “Somewhere in-between ‘super impressive’ and ‘Come in and grab something out of the fridge,’  ” Venus shares. “So we had to find that balance within the design.” Devised in consultation with Serena’s private chef, it was outfitted by V Starr with the finest appliances, including Gaggenau wall ovens, an Officine Gullo cooktop, and customized gold and black marble backsplash in a diamond-pattern mosaic that over-delivers in wow factor.1/ 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Lelanie Foster; Styling: Mieke ten HaveA guest room is painted inBenjamin Moore’s River Blue. Furniture fromWest Elm.Tennis, tech, and fashion empire-building aside, one of Serena’s favorite Williams family pastimes is karaoke. After winning the U.S. Open, the world champions would celebrate in a private karaoke room on 50th Street in Manhattan. Naturally, Serena had to have one of her own. So, just off the gallery, behind a secret doorway disguised as a bookshelf, lies a karaoke room. This unusual amenity features a small stage, a plush aquamarine velvet banquette, and foliage framing a neon sign that spells sérénade, a playful tribute to Serena’s karaoke persona.Of course, she and her sister even sing karaoke like it’s a competitive sport. House rules? No “Bohemian Rhapsody.” No “Love Shack.” No “I Will Survive.” No “Don’t Stop Believin’.” According to Serena and Venus, this room is reserved for “serious karaoke singers only.”“We all like to have a really good time,” Venus declares. “Our friends all have this very same attitude of loving great design, but not taking themselves too seriously.”Read MoreCelebrity Style14 Dazzling Celebrity Bedrooms for the Ultimate InspirationA bedroom is an extremely intimate reflection of a person’s tastes, wants, and needs—and celebrity bedrooms are no exceptionByRachel DaviesArchitecture + DesignTour a SoHo Penthouse That Blends Italian, Japanese, and American Design Sensibilities TogetherStudio Razavi created a generous, sunlight-filled triplex with a palette of rich materials and custom piecesByAnouk SarfatiAD Pro31 of the Brightest and Best Kitchens inADBecause we adore spending time in our kitchens tooByMadeleine LuckelAD-it-Yourself7 Creative Stone Slab Ideas That Go Beyond CountertopsGenius uses that will rock your interiorsByCaitlin Raux GuntherOur website, archdigest.com, offers constant original coverage of the interior design and architecture worlds, new shops and products, travel destinations, art and cultural events, celebrity style, and high-end real estate as well as access to print features and images from the AD archives.FacebookTwitterPinterestInstagramYouTubeTiktokSubscriptionsSubscribeCustomer ServiceRenew SubscriptionGive a GiftChange AddressConnect with ADAbout ADContact the EditorsNewsletter Sign UpContact AdvertisingMembership FAQsGeneral FAQsCondé Nast StoreCareersAccessibility HelpAD ReviewsCondé Nast SpotlightDo Not Sell My Personal Info©2023Condé Nast.

Take A Look Inside Serena Williams' Home×NewsExclusivesReal EstateHome RepairCleaningTipsDecorGardenCelebrityFeaturesAboutEditorial PoliciesPrivacy PolicyTerms of Use© 2023Static Media®. All Rights ReservedTake A Look Inside Serena Williams' HomeNewsExclusivesReal EstateHome RepairCleaningTipsDecorGardenFeaturesTake A Look Inside Serena Williams' HomeAlbert L. Ortega/Getty ImagesByStephen J. Schuyler/March 4, 2022  3:20 pm ESTThere are tennis players. Then there are the best-ever tennis players.Then,there's Serena Williams. Frankly, no-one's ever played the game like Williams, with her unstoppable legacy including 23 Grand Slam wins, 73 individual singles titles, earnings of almost $100 million in prize money, and more weeks as the No. 1 tennis player in the world than most of us have had hot meals, as per theWomen's Tennis Association(WTA). We mean, where do you evenbeginwith that level of success?With a legacy like that, we'd say that Williams more than deserves to enjoy her time spent off-court in style. And as one of the most fashionable players in the game, it's little wonder that when it came to her property, the superlative player opted to create a home that's as unique as she is. Her utterly gorgeouscelebrity home, located in Florida and shared with husband Alexis and daughter Olympia, is a SpanishMediterranean-styleproperty that positively oozes charm, style, and elegance (viaYouTube). And after one look at the house, we just knew we had to take our readers inside as well. Let's take a look at this jaw-dropping home.1. Serena Williams is no stranger to luxury propertyLev Radin/ShutterstockWilliams' current property is a masterclass in luxurious taste, but she's been perfecting the art of choosing and finessing high-end real estate to her liking for a while now, with an extensive property portfolio. Such is to be expected from a player worth well over$200 million, we guess. Among Williams' homes are multiple properties across the U.S., with a Spanish-style property in Bel Air and former homes in the Palm Beach area, one of which she shared with her sister Venus, according toThe Sun. Williams is no stranger to the European way of living, too, owning a luxury two-bed apartment in the heart ofParis, overlooking the Eiffel Tower.Williams clearly understands the power of mixing things up with her properties, too, both from a keeping-things-fresh perspective and on a financial level. Her former Los Angeles mansion, which she purchased in 2006 for $6.62 million, was sold in 2019 for $8.1 million, gaining her a hefty profit (viaMansion Global). Thankfully, her Florida property represents a pretty good upgrade in space from the 6,101-square-foot L.A. home, being more than double the size with 14,500 square feet of space.2. For her Florida home, Williams kept it localYouTubeDespite her international jet-setting lifestyle on the WTA tour, when it comes to home, Serena Williams likes to stick to what she knows. So when it was time to move, she stayed put in Florida, where she formerly lived in a $2.8 million West Palm Beach property purchased in 2015, as perDirt. The home, a five-bedroom, 5.5 bathroom villa-style home, was replaced in Williams' portfolio by buying the waterfront estate that she currently presides in, based in Jupiter (the town, not the planet), for a cool $8 million (viaThe Real Deal).And as it turns out, when it came to buying the riverfront property, Williams kept it in the sports world by purchasing the estate from none other than St. Louis Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina. Following the purchase, Williams also gained approval to perform renovation work on the property, which can now be seen in her stunning home.3. It was a family affair to design her propertyEmma Mcintyre/Getty ImagesNo person is an island, and tennis players know that as well as anyone else. Despite heading it up solo on the court on big match days, the team that a tennis player builds around them can be their very key to success. The same can be said for other aspects of their lives, and for Williams, when designing herFlorida home, she applied the same principles. She brought in someone she knows better than anyone else, her sister Venus, to help her shape her dream home with the help of her design firm, V Starr.Venus and her company's work on the property are displayed to stunning effect on V Starr'swebsite, where the elegant neutral aesthetic of the property is spiked with pops of color, hinting at Venus' understanding of Serena's personality and tastes. Venus' design of the property was doubly meaningful given that, before Serena lived with husband Alexis Ohanian and daughter Olympia, the sisters lived together as adults for two decades (viaPeople). Doubtless, Venus wanted to give Serena the home of her dreams –- and we'd say she succeeded.4. The home is a minimalist's dreamYouTubeThe style of the homes where we hang our hats at the end of the day is deeply personal, influenced hugely by our personalities and tastes. So as a tennis player who's famed for her precision and laser-sharp instincts, it's little surprise thatSerena Williams' homehas a focused, clean aesthetic to it that's catnip tominimalistarchitecture lovers. The house is built with order in mind, with straight lines guiding the property's architecture, creating an interior of high ceilings and towering windows. You can see this in action in a video on Williams'Instagram, in which she takes part in an adorable lightsaber battle with her daughter Olympia. (It looks like she's got mom's world-class hand-eye coordination!)The home's color palette is organized in a similarly sleek style, with white walls contrasting with black frames to create a pleasing monochromatic effect. Natural hardwood floors run throughout the property, ushering in a sense of confluence throughout the sprawling space and accentuating the more colorful aspects of the property.5. The exterior spaces make the most of the Florida landscapeInstagramWhat's aceleb homewithout a premium outside space? On this front, Williams does not disappoint. HerFlorida homeembraces the state's native landscape. The property flows almost seamlessly from indoor to outdoor, with an enclosed patio offering Serena and her guests space to relax when it starts to look a little overcast (or for her to chill on her own, as she's seen doing in anInstagrampost). The patio overlooks the water flowing by Williams' house and is styled in the same combination of whites, blacks, and muted neutrals that the rest of the home favors, with elegant deck furniture in grays and light woods.If you thought that a simplepatiowould be the end of outdoor features in this property, you'd be mistaken. In addition to the generous green space the estate has, there's also a stunning infinity pool, with a raised spa in the middle, set in deep blue tones. Within the pool are sunken sun loungers, allowing Williams to sunbathe while she soaks, and alongside it, an angular stone deck provides the perfect place to relax after a long day on the court.6. Her Florida home is an open-plan havenYouTubeWilliams was never going to do things like everyone else, and when it came to the design of her house, she banished a sense of separation between rooms. Instead, her home embraces an open-plan sensibility, seen from the very moment that Williams opens her door in herArchitectural Digesthome tour. The spaces in the property blend seamlessly into one another as Williams walks through the area, with the art gallery becoming the library becoming the music space. Despite this, Williams still understands the value of isolating certain rooms to maintain function. That includes her office, a cozy nook adorned with posters from her magazine shoots, and with pops of bright pink in the office furniture.While the idea of open-plan living might seem like a daunting prospect, you can create the aesthetic for yourself with a few simple tips. The most important thing to remember is that any space you create will eventually need to belivedin, so design with you and your family's day-to-day living experience in mind (viaLoveProperty).7. The kitchen combines neutrals with statement shadesInstagramSure, a kitchen is one of the most functional spaces in your house, but why shouldn't it also be the classiest darn space you can muster? This is a belief we hold dear to our heart, and we're frankly deeply gratified that Williams appears to agree.Her home'skitchen marries utility and luxury effortlessly. The kitchen continues the home's running aesthetic of clean neutral colors, with a white centerislandand chairs nestled against darker wooden furniture, shown in a photo on daughter Olympia'sInstagram. The hardwood flooring that runs throughout the rest of the house serves here to create a sense of comfort and homeliness in the space.What we love about this kitchen, however, is the vibrant, confident use of gold. From the backsplash to the tap spouts, gold is everywhere, drawing a feeling of luxury and excitement into Williams' cooking area. If you're looking for your own revamp, don't be shy when using golds in your kitchen, particularly if it's already kitted out in dark neutrals. "In terms of material pairing, a metallic accent works so well in darker kitchens. For example, polished handles or gleaming pendant lighting will reinforce the intense color of the cabinetry," design director Tom Howley tellsThe Independent.8. The home is full of one-of-a-kind featuresInstagramWhen it comes to the design choices of herFlorida home, Williams wanted things to stand out. And stand out they certainly do, with her house filled with unique decor choices that speak to her personality and taste. Strolling through the property, it's hard not to see some of the design decisions as artistic statements in themselves, with elements like her sleek, recessed fireplace providing function while offering a focal point for her and her guests to enjoy (seen viaInstagram).Elsewhere, Williams goesboldwith her aesthetic, like in the case of her dining room, in which the eye is immediately drawn to the light fixtures hanging above the stylish table. They're a collection of pendant lamps, which somehow, despite being a multitude of different styles, all work together to create one stunning piece. Focusing light fixtures as the central design moment in a room is bang-on-trend for 2022, says Smart Lighting Industries design expert Valentina Gori, who encourages people to be brave. "Thoughtfully placed, cleverly designed, and carefully crafted ceiling lights will transform rooms. Lighting will become a starting point for design rather than being left until last. Don't be afraid to go bold with your ceiling lighting," she tellsHomes & Gardens. It looks like Williams has thoroughly embraced this ethos!9. There's plenty of dedicated space for daughter OlympiaInstagramWhen Williams moved herself and her young family intoher home, she knew that her daughter Olympia needed a pretty special room. And wow,did mom deliver on that front. Williams and her husband Ohanian worked together to create a space for Olympia that was one of a kind. With a pink custom-designed castle bed, the end result is truly worthy of royalty, as perArchitectural Digest.Williams and Ohanian (who stepped in to spearhead Olympia's room design, while Williams took charge of the rest of the property's design choices) also ensured there was room for artistry in the bedroom, with a bespoke blown-glass chandelier by artist Josh Fradis. However, the stand-out moment in the room probably isn't the lighting choices, but theliteral built-in slidethat the castle bed came equipped with. "She goes down the slide every night while we're thinking, man, we shouldn't have done that, because now at bedtime, she just wants to slide," says Williams, speaking with the knowledge that only someone who's ever tried to put a child to bed at night possesses. "But whatever makes her happy makes me happy."10. The home isn't just about aesthetics — it's also about philosophyYouTubeIt's all too easy to assume that when it comes tocelebrity homes, the choices are just made for the people living there. But as Williams' house shows, celebrity houses are most successful when they consider the philosophy of the person living there. For Williams, there is a clear emphasis on the home as a space to live in and a space to be inspired by, as is clear from her decision to remove her formal living room. As seen in herhome tour, rather than seeing a comfy sofa when you walk in, you're greeted by pieces of one-of-a-kind art.The same philosophy for active creation exists in her media/club room, where she's abandoned the classic celeb vibe of a built-in movie theater. "I didn't want a movie theater room, cos I'm like, I just don't want to sit and watch movies. But I wanted something that was super functional," she said during the tour. The result is a vibrant, active space full of color and prints. It has its very own stage upon which Williams and daughter Olympia perform karaoke together.11. The home is chock-full of interesting spacesYouTubeWitha homeas sprawling as Williams', it's perhaps not surprising that you'll find some pretty unique decor gems dotted throughout. Take a look at her wine cellar, for example, seen on V Starr'swebsite. Instead of just a classic rectangular wine rack, Williams has opted to mix things up with unique geometric shelving to create a design moment. The subtle overheadrecessed lightswork with the room's dark wood and gold aesthetic to make a mood as mature and elegant as a glass of vintage Merlot.Or, for a different feel entirely, check out Williams' walk-in closet, seen via V Starr. To avoid the space feeling anonymous and clinical, Serena and Venus kept sterile whites mainly at bay, and instead chose to kit the space out in welcoming wooden tones for the drawers, shelves, and floors. They also included classy gold pulls and subtle lighting. The result is a closet in which you could happily spend hours trying on clothes.12. The house has its very own art galleryYouTubeIn most houses, you're doing well if you've managed to get a single piece of art in somewhere. However, Williams went to the next level by putting an art gallery inher house. Yep. There's a reason why she's the greatest of all time, folks.Williams' art gallery, which can be seen the moment you enter the property, is a space lovingly curated by the tennis superstar, and reflects her sources of inspiration. Among the works displayed is "Astro Black" by Atlanta-based artist Radcliffe Bailey, a mixed-media piece that contains a piece of lunar rock in the canvas, according toCulture Type. The "Monument for a Promise," another piece of work by Bailey, is placed near Brooklyn-based artist Leonardo Drew's piece "Number 184," an abstract piece created in black wood. Alongside these stunning pieces of work is an object of a different kind: A clear Plexiglass piano, which Williams sought out with the help of V Starr for daughter Olympia to play. Williams clearly has her own fun with it, as seen viaInstagram, where she contrasts the "Instagram" expectation of playing "Für Elise" flawlessly with the "reality" of playing "Do Re Mi" note-by-note. We're not sure we could do much better, to be honest!13. Williams' tennis career is firmly on displayYouTubeSo, spoiler alert: Williams has won a lot of trophies. Like, alot.And when you've won almost two dozen Grand Slams, you're gonna need somewhere to put them all. That's why Williams elected to build her very own trophy room in the property, displaying "some of" her plaudits, as she shows in herhome tour. The room has two separate racks opposite each other, with the gentle black frames of the racks and minimalist design choices showcasing the highlights from her career.Among the things displayed is a unique Wheaties box with a picture of Williams celebrating a win, and more Grand Slam awards than most people will ever see in their lives, despite Williams claiming otherwise in her home tour. "There's a U.S. Open Trophy. Okay. Here's one. That's 2002 ... okay. That was a while ago. Thislookslike one ... I am so bad with trophies," she proclaims as she works backward, discovering yet more wins that she'd forgotten were there. After the career she's had, we can see why it's hard to keep track!14. Serena Williams' bathroom has to be seen to be believedVivien Killilea/Getty ImagesWhile all of Williams' home is frankly gorgeous, there's one room that we simply couldn't ignore. Her bathroom is a piece of pure design elegance, a vision in whites and metallic tones, as seen via V Starr'swebsite. The floor has a subtle diamond tile effect, shifting to larger squares in the walk-in washing section. Inside the washing space, dual shower heads in gold tones sit opposite the almost absurdly classy freestanding tub, a bright white affair with gold accents. The whole space is delineated by huge plate-glass windows, with a gold trim running around them.Light pours into the space from widescreen windows placed high-up to preserve privacy, through which hints of greenery peek through. The washing space is completed by a white and gray marble wall, with gold staining its top edges. Honestly, this is bathing in pure style.Recommended

We’re in my car, and she’s holding my phone, using an interactive educational app she likes. This robot voice asks her a question: What do you want to be when you grow up? She doesn’t know I’m listening, but I can hear the answer she whispers into the phone. She says, “I want to be a big sister.”STANDING TALLSergio Hudson dress. Fernando Jorge earring.Fashion Editor: Gabriella Karefa-Johnson.Olympia says this a lot, even when she knows I’m listening. Sometimes before bed, she prays to Jehovah to bring her a baby sister. (She doesn’t want anything to do with a boy!) I’m the youngest of five sisters myself, and my sisters are my heroes, so this has felt like a moment I need to listen very carefully to.Believe me, I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don’t think it’s fair. If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family. Maybe I’d be more of a Tom Brady if I had that opportunity. Don’t get me wrong: I love being a woman, and I loved every second of being pregnant with Olympia. I was one of those annoying women who adored being pregnant and was working until the day I had to report to the hospital—although things got super complicated on the other side. And I almost did do the impossible: A lot of people don’t realize that I was two months pregnant when I won the Australian Open in 2017. But I’m turning 41 this month, and something’s got to give.I’ve been reluctant to admit that I have to move on from playing tennis. It’s like a taboo topic. It comes up, and I start to cry. I think the only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapistI have never liked the wordretirement.It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me. I’ve been thinking of this as a transition, but I want to be sensitive about how I use that word, which means something very specific and important to a community of people. Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to isevolution.I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me. A few years ago I quietly started Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm. Soon after that, I started a family. I want to grow that family.But I’ve been reluctant to admit to myself or anyone else that I have to move on from playing tennis. Alexis, my husband, and I have hardly talked about it; it’s like a taboo topic. I can’t even have this conversation with my mom and dad. It’s like it’s not real until you say it out loud. It comes up, I get an uncomfortable lump in my throat, and I start to cry. The only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapist! One thing I’m not going to do is sugarcoat this. I know that a lot of people are excited about and look forward to retiring, and I really wish I felt that way. Ashleigh Barty was number one in the world when she left the sport this March, and I believe she really felt ready to move on. Caroline Wozniacki, who is one of my best friends, felt a sense of relief when she retired in 2020.LIVING LEGENDSPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz with sister Venus Williams inVogue, May 1998.Praise to these people, but I’m going to be honest. There is no happiness in this topic for me. I know it’s not the usual thing to say, but I feel a great deal of pain. It’s the hardest thing that I could ever imagine. I hate it. I hate that I have to be at this crossroads. I keep saying to myself, I wish it could be easy for me, but it’s not. I’m torn: I don’t want it to be over, but at the same time I’m ready for what’s next. I don’t know how I’m going to be able to look at this magazine when it comes out, knowing that this is it, the end of a story that started in Compton, California, with a little Black girl who just wanted to play tennis. This sport has given me so much. I love to win. I love the battle. I love to entertain. I’m not sure every player sees it that way, but I love the performance aspect of it—to be able to entertain people week after week. Some of the happiest times in my life were spent waiting in that hallway in Melbourne, and walking out into Rod Laver Arena with my earphones in and trying to stay focused and drown out the noise but still feeling the energy of the crowd. Night matches in Arthur Ashe Stadium at Flushing Meadows. Hitting an ace on set point.My whole life, up to now, has been tennis. My dad says I first picked up a racket when I was three, but I think it was even earlier. There’s a picture of Venus pushing me in a stroller on a tennis court, and I couldn’t have been more than 18 months. Unlike Venus, who’s always been stoic and classy, I’ve never been one to contain my emotions. I remember learning to write my alphabet for kindergarten and not doing it perfectly and crying all night. I was so angry about it. I’d erase and rewrite thatAover and over, and my mother let me stay up all night while my sisters were in bed. That’s always been me. I want to be great. I want to be perfect. I know perfect doesn’t exist, but whatever my perfect was, I never wanted to stop until I got it right.To me that’s kind of the essence of being Serena: expecting the best from myself and proving people wrong. There were so many matches I won because something made me angry or someone counted me out. That drove me. I’ve built a career on channeling anger and negativity and turning it into something good. My sister Venus once said that when someone out there says you can’t do something, it is because they can’t do it. But I did do it. And so can you.POWER PLAYERPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz inVogue, April 2003.If you watchedKing Richard,then you know that when I was little, I was not very good at tennis. I was so sad when I didn’t get all the early opportunities that Venus got, but that helped me. It made me work harder, turning me into a savage fighter. I’d travel to tournaments with Venus as her hitting partner, and if there was an open slot, I’d play. I followed her around the world and watched her. When she lost, I understood why, and I made sure I wouldn’t lose the same way. That’s how I started to move so fast up the rankings, because I learned the lessons from Venus’s losses instead of the hard way, from my own. It was as if I were playing her matches, too. I’m a good mimic. Growing up I tried to copy Pete Sampras. I loved Monica Seles, and then I studied Monica Seles. I watched, I listened, then I attacked. But if I hadn’t been in Venus’s shadow, I would never be who I am. When someone said I was just the little sister, that’s when I got really fired up.I started playing tennis with the goal of winning the U.S. Open. I didn’t think past that. And then I just kept winning. I remember when I passed Martina Hingis’s grand slam count. Then Seles’s. And then I tied Billie Jean King, who is such an inspiration for me because of how she has pioneered gender equality in all sports. Then it was climbing over the Chris Evert–Martina Navratilova mountain. There are people who say I’m not the GOAT because I didn’t pass Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam titles, which she achieved before the “open era” that began in 1968. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want that record. Obviously I do. But day to day, I’m really not thinking about her. If I’m in a grand slam final, then yes, I am thinking about that record. Maybe I thought about it too much, and that didn’t help. The way I see it, I should have had 30-plus grand slams. I had my chances after coming back from giving birth. I went from a C-section to a second pulmonary embolism to a grand slam final. I played while breastfeeding. I played through postpartum depression. But I didn’t get there. Shoulda, woulda, coulda. I didn’t show up the way I should have or could have. But I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine. Actually it’s extraordinary. But these days, if I have to choose between building my tennis résumé and building my family, I choose the latter.QUEEN OF THE COURTPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz inVogue, April 2015.Earlier in my career, I never thought about having kids. There were times when I’ve wondered if I should ever bring kids into this world, with all its problems. I was never that confident or comfortable around babies or children, and I figured that if I ever did have a baby, I would have people taking care of it 24/7. I’m not going to lie—I definitely have a lot of support. But I’m also an incredibly hands-on mother. My husband will tell you I am too hands-on. In five years, Olympia has only spent one 24-hour period away from me. This past year, while I was recovering from a hamstring injury, I got to pick her up from school four or five days a week, and I always looked forward to seeing her face light up when she walked out of the building and saw me waiting there for her. The fact is that nothing is a sacrifice for me when it comes to Olympia. It all just makes sense. I want to teach her how to tie her shoes, how to read, where babies come from, and about God. Just like my mom taught me. As she grows, it’s something different every month. Lately she’s been into watching baking shows, which we do together. Now we bake with Play-Doh, which is so much fun. She loves this game called The Floor Is Lava, where you have to do whatever you can to avoid touching the ground. I love setting up my gym for the game, arranging my step-up boxes and weight machines like an obstacle course. Whatever she likes, I like.AT EASE“I want to be great. I want to be perfect. I know perfect doesn’t exist, but whatevermy perfect was, I never wanted to stop until I got it right.” Ralph Lauren Collection dress.MOTHER LOVE“I’m an incredibly hands-on mother. Nothing is a sacrifice when it comes to Olympia. It all just makes sense.” Danielle Frankel gown.I think tennis, by comparison, has always felt like a sacrifice—though it’s one I enjoyed making. When you’re younger, you see kids having fun, and you want to do that stuff but you know you have to be on the court, hoping that one day it will all pay off. I got pushed hard by my parents. Nowadays so many parents say, “Let your kids do what they want!” Well, that’s not what got me where I am. I didn’t rebel as a kid. I worked hard, and I followed the rules. I do want to push Olympia—not in tennis, but in whatever captures her interest. But I don’t want to push too hard. I’m still trying to figure out that balance.In my own life, the balance has been slowly shifting toward Serena Ventures. I always say that I’m a sponge: At night I go to bed and I squeeze myself out so that the next day I can take up as much new information as I can. Every morning, I’m so excited to walk downstairs to my office and jump onto Zooms and start reviewing decks of companies we’re considering investing in. We’re a small but growing firm of six people scattered between Florida, where I mainly live, Texas, and California. I started investing nine years ago, and I really fell in love with early stage, whether it’s pre-seed funding, where you’re investing in just an idea, or seed, where the idea has already been turned into a product. I wrote one of the very first checks for MasterClass. It’s one of 16 unicorns—companies valued at more than $1 billion—that Serena Ventures has funded, along with Tonal, Impossible Foods, Noom, and Esusu, to name a few. This year we raised $111 million of outside financing, from banks, private individuals, and family offices. Seventy-​eight percent of our portfolio happens to be companies started by women and people of color, because that’s who we are. On the other hand, my husband is white, and it’s important to me to be inclusive of everyone. Serena Ventures has been an all-female business until recently, when we brought in our first guy—a diversity hire!FEELING GRAND“I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine. Actually it’s extraordinary.” Wales Bonner dress. Lagos chain necklace. Dezso by Sara Beltran pendant.A few years ago, I was at a conference organized by JPMorgan Chase, where I watched a talk between Jamie Dimon and Caryn Seidman-Becker, the CEO of the security company Clear. Caryn explained that less than 2 percent of all VC money went to women. I figured that she misspoke. I thought, There’s no way that 98 percent of that capital is going to men. I approached her afterward, and she confirmed it. I kind of understood then and there that someone who looks like me needs to start writing the big checks. Sometimes like attracts like. Men are writing those big checks to one another, and in order for us to change that, more people who look like me need to be in that position, giving money back to themselves. I’m so grateful to women like Caryn, as well as Sheryl Sandberg and others who have mentored me. It’s important to have women like that who believe in you and push you to think bigger and do bigger.I’d like to think that thanks to me, women athletes can be themselves. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it allIn the last year, Alexis and I have been trying to have another child, and we recently got some information from my doctor that put my mind at ease and made me feel that whenever we’re ready, we can add to our family. I definitely don’t want to be pregnant again as an athlete. I need to be two feet into tennis or two feet out.This spring, I had the itch to get back on the court for the first time in seven months. I was talking to Tiger Woods, who’s a friend, and I told him I needed his advice on my tennis career. I said, “I don’t know what to do: I think I’m over it, but maybe I’m not over it.” He’s Tiger, and he was adamant that I be a beast the same way he is! He said, “Serena, what if you just gave it two weeks? You don’t have to commit to anything. You just go out on the court every day for two weeks and give it your all and see what happens.” I said, “All right, I think I can do that.” And I didn’t do it. But a month later, I gave it a try. And it felt magical to pick up a racket again. And I was good. I was really good. I went back and forth about whether to play Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open after that. As I’ve said, this whole evolution thing has not been easy for me.I don’t particularly like to think about my legacy. I get asked about it a lot, and I never know exactly what to say. But I’d like to think that thanks to opportunities afforded to me, women athletes feel that they can be themselves on the court. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can be strong yet beautiful. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it all. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career. Mistakes are learning experiences, and I embrace those moments. I’m far from perfect, but I’ve also taken a lot of criticism, and I’d like to think that I went through some hard times as a professional tennis player so that the next generation could have it easier. Over the years, I hope that people come to think of me as symbolizing something bigger than tennis. I admire Billie Jean because she transcended her sport. I’d like it to be: Serena is this and she’s thatandshe was a great tennis playerandshe won those slams.Unfortunately I wasn’t ready to win Wimbledon this year. And I don’t know if I will be ready to win New York. But I’m going to try. And the lead-up tournaments will be fun. I know there’s a fan fantasy that I might have tied Margaret that day in London, then maybe beat her record in New York, and then at the trophy ceremony say, “See ya!” I get that. It’s a good fantasy. But I’m not looking for some ceremonial, final on-court moment. I’m terrible at goodbyes, the world’s worst. But please know that I am more grateful for you than I can ever express in words. You have carried me to so many wins and so many trophies. I’m going to miss that version of me, that girl who played tennis. And I’m going to miss you.HAPPY DAYSGucci Exquisite MTO gown.

					Last updated 4/21/21Green Day is generally best known forGrammy-winningrecord of the year "Boulevard Of Broken Dreams" ortop-10 Hot 100single "Wake Me Up When September Ends," but Serena Williams is a big enough fan of the punk rock band that she prefers the deep cuts.Frontman Billie Joe Armstrong joinedJimmy Kimmel Livefor Tuesday night's episode to promote his new Audible projectWelcome To My Panic(out Thursday), but the conversation eventually veered toward Williams' fandom.Kimmel recalled the time he invited the tennis icon to the show to meet Green Day, which paid off for him at the 2012 London Olympics."She was playing in the Olympics that day at Wimbledon and gave us a tour—a lengthy tour—of Wimbledon on the day she was playing," Kimmel told the 49-year-old musician, "and I was like, 'You don't have to do this!' I was panicking that maybe she might lose because she's not focused. She's like, 'No, no. You introduced me to Green Day, so I owe you.' And then she won the gold medal.""She's great," Armstrong replied. "We would run into her in different countries in Europe because she was kicking everybody's a— in that particular country. ... I think she would literally try to see how fast she could beat her opponent so she could actually come to the gig. She would end up showing up, and she would always ask for us to play the song 'Disappearing Boy.'""Disappearing Boy" was originally released on the track list of Green Day's April 1990 debut studio album39/Smooth.

Best Vegan Ice Cream: Plant-Based Ice Cream Brands to Try Right Now - ThrillistSkip to main contentLike Thrillist on Facebook.Follow Thrillist on Instagram.Follow Thrillist on Twitter.Subscribe to Thrillist on YouTube.Follow Thrillist on TikTok.SUBSCRIBEGo to NavigationCitiesNewsTravelEatDrinkEatThe Tastiest Plant-Based Ice CreamsChickpea ice cream? Count me in.ByAdriana VelezUpdated on 7/24/2020 at 2:15 PMCourtesy of Little Chickpea Ice CreamWhen I attempted my first taste of Portland restaurateur Micah Camden’sLittle Chickpea ice creamI did what everyone always does: I took a tiny spoonful and raised it slowly, hesitantly to my mouth. Can you blame me? Ice cream made from chickpeas... shudder. I braced for a sandy and watery texture, a funky bean aftertaste, and that awkward moment when I smile anyway and say something polite.After just one taste, I went for a much larger spoonful when it was time for my second bite.They got it right. The creamy mouthfeel, no bad texture, the clear, true flavors free of beany-ness, everything you’d want from any ice cream, vegan or dairy, they were all there. We did a flight starting with their cherry chai, then Szechuan strawberry, then mint matcha, and finally, the deep, dark triple chocolate (they also make Cold Brew Coffee and Blackberry Basil). No basics here; each flavor has layers and ranges from delicate to intense with finesse. It helps that each of the flavors we tried also has a subtle element of savory to them that probably plays well with the chickpea base. But then again, that’s on-trend for flavors these days.Now for the bad news. This vegan ice cream is currently available only at the Little Chickpea shop in Portland, and no, they don’t ship. Camden is introducing the brand ever so slowly. They'll do pop-ups in New York City, Los Angeles, Austin, and San Francisco, and Camden wants to get the story of chickpea ice cream out ahead of filling up freezer shelves.Little Chickpea was the first vegan ice cream to really turn my head and make me take the plant-based dessert wave seriously. As a longtime vegan ice cream skeptic I have been rejecting pints left and right. I’m a committed omnivore who digests dairy just fine, thank you. (I lie. Dairy gives me puffy Benicio del Toro eyes.) Still, it takes a lot to lure me away from cow cream.And look, we’re going to be honest with you: the coconut milk-based ice creams we’ve tried thus far simply don’t do it for us (and yes, we keep trying new ones). There’s always at least a faint flavor of coconut milk -- not that there’s anything terrible about that, as long as you like coconut. We’re OK with it forcertain vegan yogurts. But coconut is one of those flavors... either you like it or you hate it, you know? And at this point in the plant-based treats game, we don’t believe a preference for coconut milk should be a prerequisite for enjoying vegan ice cream.As foroat milk ice cream, keep trying. You’re not there... yet.For that matter, should we be calling these frozen desserts “ice cream” if they’re not made from dairy cream? We’ll let other folks take up that debate. Until the dust clears, we’re just going to keep going with ”ice cream” to keep things simple.Anyway, this encounter with chickpea ice cream got me combing the local artisan shops to see if anything else comes close. I dragged my colleagueNicole Taylorwith me (it was not hard to convince her) and we found a few other flavors we liked.Thrillist TVWine and CheeseburgerWine and Cheeseburger: Harley and Lara Pair Falafel with WineCourtesy of Morgenstern'sMorgenstern’s Sesame CaramelAvailableonline for nationwide shippingand at shop locations in New York CityWhen other ice cream entrepreneurs aren’t working with coconut milk, they’re usually experimenting with nut milks. Almond has proven a bust. But cashew shows promise, especially in Morgenstern’s cashmere-soft sesame caramel. That’s a barely-burnt caramel with only the slightest hint of bitterness giving the buttery mellow of tahini an edge. This is a perfect flavor profile for cashew milk, which makes an almost neutral, rich and creamy canvas for grown-up dessert flavors.OddFellows Dark Chocolate ChunkAvailable at shop locations in New York City and BostonOddFellows has been whipping up some plant-based magic at their Bushwick factory. We tried their dark chocolate chunk, which was so alluring I couldn’t stop eating it. The base is macadamia nut milk, not my favorite nut. But what makes macadamia nuts too extra for snacking (the richness, the richness, and also the richness) makes them ideal for ice cream.OddFellows has a process that removes nut flavors, leaving behind a neutral creamy base. They have a few other flavors using other nuts like hazelnut.EclipseAvailableonline for nationwide shippingor in the Bay Area atMitchell’s Ice Cream,Acre Pizza,The Good Scoop, andMilkbomb; in New York atby CHLOE.andOddFellows; in Los Angeles atHoneybee Burger,Wanderlust Creamery, andLong Beach Creamery; and in Washington, D.C. atIce Cream JubileeandEquinox RestaurantStraight outta Silicon Valley, this Alexis Ohanian (Serena Williams’ husband and Reddit founder)-backed company got sciency with their plant-based ice cream. The “alternative protein expert” founders use a blend of heirloom corn, cassava, and oats to “replicate milk on a molecular level,” as they put it, producing a dessert that’s free of soy, nuts, coconut, gluten, GMOs, gums and stabilizers.But let’s get out of the lab and into the bowl. How does it taste? We tried their vanilla, chocolate, and Biscoff flavors, and they are indeed thick, rich, and creamy. Texture nailed. The Biscoff flavor is sweeter than we prefer, but the chocolate and vanilla are less so. The vanilla flavor is nice, but they could stand to bump up the cocoa in the chocolate. Our tasters did detect the teensiest of aftertaste, but it’s hard to know if we would have noticed that if we didn’t know it was plant-based.Courtesy of Jeni's Splendid Ice CreamsJeni’s Splendid Ice CreamsAvailableonline for nationwide shipping, at scoop shops, and in stores across the countryWhat I said about coconut milk-based ice creams? I have to take it back when it comes to Jeni’s. They use coconut cream, rather than milk, and that coconutty flavor is undetectable in their dark chocolate truffle and their roasted peanut butter and strawberry jam. I could just barely detect it in the Texas sheet cake, but the overall flavor is bomb so I don’t even care. What I did notice, though, was that while the mouthfeel is creamy I’m picking up that texture you get from thickening agents (carob bean gum and sunflower lecithin).CoolhausAvailableonline for nationwide shipping, in its Culver City scoop shop, and in stores nationwideThis a widely-available vegan ice cream we like, with a caveat: we recommend it in sandwich form. The base is made from yellow peas--hello, chickpea cousin (and main ingredient of vegan protein supplement products by Orgain and alt milk Ripple)--along with brown rice and cocoa butter and various other thickeners and stabilizers. While not soaring to the heights of these others, it’s the most respectable mass-market vegan treat we’ve tried so far. Sandwiching the ice cream between cookies improves the overall experience. We especially like theDirty Mint flavor.All things considered, we can’t help but return to the chickpea ice cream because of everything else it has to offer in addition to taste. There’s the sustainability factor, since chickpeas can grow in practically any climate (unlike nuts or coconut). Chickpea allergies aren’t nearly as prevalent as nut allergies, so there’s that as well. Are chickpeas winning the plant-based ice cream game? Only you, the tasters, will tell.Sign up herefor our daily Thrillist email, getEatmailfor more food coverage, andsubscribe herefor our YouTube channel to get your fix of the best in food/drink/fun.Adriana Velezis a senior food editor at Thrillist.By signing up, I agree to theTermsandPrivacy Policy.Cookie SettingsNewsletterAccessibilityAdvertise With UsCareersCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationPressPrivacyTerms + ConditionsThis publication is a Vox Media network.©2023Vox Media, LLC.

Ever wonder how she fuels those powerful serves? So did we, which is why we went right to the source, to ask one of the two most famous sisters in tennis about how she eats, how she cooks, and what victory truly tastes like.Is there a Williams-family signature dish?Serena Williams: That's easy: My mom's chicken, with rice and gravy. It was my favorite dish as a kid, and it still is now. That's my favorite meal from her or from anybody. I was just competing in Australia, and she was going to make it for me, but she forgot. Now she owes me! It's a family favorite. But there are more. Venus cooks a lot. My other two other sisters cook. For years, I was always making gumbo for everyone. My other go-to dishes are something I call a "seven-bean delight," which really only has five beans, but don't tell. Everyone loves my roasted chicken with garlic; for a minute, it was my turkey tacos. Now it's vegan sushi. I just love to cook!Can you recite one of those recipes by heart?SW: The easiest is my roasted chicken recipe. I make it French style. I put whole cloves of garlic all over the dish. Some under the skin, some inside the chicken, some inside the pan. I put butter on top of the bird, and butter inside the gut. It's not a light dish! I add only a little salt and pepper, not too much. Then I throw small baby onions everywhere, drizzle olive oil on top and roast away.Is there a cookbook you're obsessed with?SW: My go-to cookbook is calledEat Yourself Sexy! I've been eating a lot healthier for my sister [Ed note: This is because of Venus'sSjogren Syndrome] so the cookbook has all these raw meals, green juices, and smoothies. For me, "green" used to mean "yuck." But I've incorporated a lot of raw things in my diet this year. Venus calls us "chegan"—because we cheat with a little bit of fish and chicken.If you could eat a meal cooked by any chef in the world, who would it be?SW: My mom! I grew up watching my mom in the kitchen, that's how I know anything about cooking. I've always wanted to go to a culinary class actually. Besides my mom, I love Bobby Flay, Emeril, Morimoto—that guy is awesome.What are your favorite Wimbledon eats?SW: For Wimbledon, our chef,Lauren Von Der Pool, travels with us because I try to eat really healthy at that one. No roasted chicken on that trip for me. We have either her or my mom make our meals around match time. Unfortunately, there's no real "restaurant-hopping" when I'm away. Truthfully, I don't eat a lot before my matches. I can't eat because I get too nervous. I'll force myself to really carb up the night before, especially later on in the tournament, because I know I wont be able to eat in the morning. But carbing-up doesn't mean pasta—I'm more into brown rice or sprouted quinoa.What do you eat once you win?SW: Celebration food is always my mom's chicken. I request it every time, along with her biscuits.Are you a sweet or savory person?SW: I'm the deadliest of both: savoryandsweet. I love those molten lava cakes, the ones where you cut into it and the chocolate spills out. Even if it's terrible, I can't say no to those. The best ones are at Nobu because they serve it with green tea ice cream. Ridiculously delicious.If you could get an endorsement deal from any food, what would it be?SW: Oh my god, I don't know! Okay. I love moon pies. If "Moon Pie" sponsored me, I'd be bigger than any house on this planet! I love the originals: banana, chocolate, or vanilla. Now I really want a Moon Pie!Describe your last dinner party.SW: I cook for my family a lot, but I've only thrown one proper dinner party, and it was when I was in my gumbo stage. I made a fish-based gumbo because I don't eat red meat or pork. It was basically seared barramundi with mangoes over quinoa, and kale with a mustard sauce on the side.What's your ideal dinner party music?SW: Either soft '90s or jazz. John Coltrane, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and you can't play jazz without Miles Davis.If you could cook dinner for anyone, who would it be and what would you serve?SW: Arthur Ashe and Althea Gibson, because they were black and played tennis, andthatwasn't popular in their time. Both are dead now, but I'd really love to have them over. I'd just make a quick salad so we could talk and talk.What does victory taste like?SW: Victory is very, very sweet. It tastes better than any dessert you've ever had.Do you drink?SW: I'm very much a glass-of-wine girl. I love Cabernets, and most French wines. But I'm not a wine snob—I'm cool with a $7 bottle of Riesling from the local Publix.Where is your dream eating trip?SW: I have to say: South Carolina. I love the Southern palate. Those southern meals, there's nothing like it. I'm always eating really healthy now, so I dream of those.What's always in your fridge?SW: My fridge is really just vegan: coconut water, Gatorade (my favorite!), cucumbers, mint, kale, vegetables, ginger, and wheat grass.What foods do you detest?SW: I hate avocados. The texture is so yucky in my mouth. I don't love tomatoes, but if they're diced up I can get them down. And while I really love Japanese food, I can't do those fish eggs that are really fat, big, and orange. I don't like those.How do you eat when flying?SW: These days, I bring a green drink for the plane and something like a wrap with sprouts and fake-tuna made of walnuts. It's actually really, really good!Do you have a food philosophy?SW:You put out what you put in.In other words, just because I get all this exercise, it doesn't mean I don't have to think about it.Explore Bon AppétitFamilyHealthyInterviewsRead MorecookingI Tried Trader Joe’s Burrata Ravioloni, Then Went Back for 3 More BoxesByAlex BeggscookingCheesy Arancini and More Recipes BA Staff Cooked This WeekByThe Bon Appétit Staff & ContributorsrestaurantsThe Best Restaurants of March, According to BA StaffByElazar SontagcookingIt’s-Finally-Spring Pasta and More Recipes BA Staff Cooked This WeekByThe Bon Appétit Staff & ContributorsRecipes you want to make.

How do we channel our drive, ingenuity, even our pain, into something more meaningful than individual success? And what is our duty in the places where we live, work, and play?These questions are at the heart of the American journey. They are also ones that Howard Schultz has grappled with personally since growing up in the Brooklyn housing projects and while building Starbucks from eleven stores into one of the world's most iconic brands.InFrom the Ground Up,Schultz looks for answers in two interwoven narratives. One story shows how his conflicted boyhood--including experiences he has never before revealed--motivated Schultz to become the first in his family to graduate from college, then to build the kind of company his father, a working-class laborer, never had a chance to work for: a business that tries to balance profit and human dignity.A parallel story offers a behind-the-scenes look at Schultz's unconventional efforts to challenge old notions about the role of business in society. From health insurance and free college tuition for part-time baristas to controversial initiatives about race and refugees, Schultz and his team tackled societal issues with the same creativity and rigor they applied to changing how the world consumes coffee.Throughout the book, Schultz introduces a cross-section of Americans transforming common struggles into shared successes. In these pages, lost youth find first jobs, aspiring college students overcome the yoke of debt, post-9/11 warriors replace lost limbs with indomitable spirit, former coal miners and opioid addicts pave fresh paths, entrepreneurs jump-start dreams, and better angels emerge from all corners of the country.From the Ground Upis part candid memoir, part uplifting blueprint of mutual responsibility, and part proof that ordinary people can do extraordinary things. At its heart, it's an optimistic, inspiring account of what happens when we stand up, speak out, and come together for purposes bigger than ourselves. Here is a new vision of what can be when we try our best to lead lives through the lens of humanity."Howard Schultz's story is a clear reminder that success is not achieved through individual determination alone, but through partnership and community. Howard's commitment to both have helped him build one of the world's most recognized brands. It will be exciting to see what he accomplishes next."--Bill GateslessRecommended byBill Gates,Serena Williams,Adam Grant,and 3 others.Bill GatesHoward Schultz’s story is a clear reminder that success is not achieved through individual determination alone, but through partnership and community.

10 Books About Serena Williams That You Should ReadFacebookTwitterAboutBlogBook ClubLet’s Work TogetherShopContactSelect Page10 Books About Serena Williams That You Should ReadbySharee Hereford|Sep 9, 2022|Black Authors,Black Literature,Latest Updates,listicle,Sistah Girl Listicles,Sistah Girls Book Club|0 commentsSistah Girls, Serena Williams is the greatest athlete of all time–full stop. We watched as the young girl from Compton rise to fame because of her outstanding athleticism in the game of tennis.Williams has won more Grand Slam singles titles (23) than any other woman or man during the open era. And if that wasn’t enough, when teamed up with her sister Venus Williams they have taken home 14 Grand Slam doubles, the second most for a pair in the open era.After announcing her retirement from the sport, Williams played her final match at the US Open (which was also the most watched match in its 43-year history) against Australia’s Ajla Tomljanović. Fans cheered from the stands and from their homes as Williams took her final bow in the third round.Williams is more than an amazing athlete she’s also a great businesswoman and yes, an author too. We’ve rounded up some books authored by our champ as well as other books about her that you should definitely read.On the Lineby Serena WilliamsFrom growing up in the tough, hardscrabble neighborhood of Compton, California, to being trained by her father on public tennis courts littered with broken glass and drug paraphernalia, to becoming the top women’s player in the world, Serena has proven to be an inspiration to her legions of fans both young and old.Her accomplishments have not been without struggle: being derailed by injury, devastated by the tragic shooting of her older sister, and criticized for her unorthodox approach to tennis.Yet somehow, Serena always manages to prevail. Both on the court and off, she’s applied the strength and determination that helped her to become a champion to successful pursuits in philanthropy, fashion, television, and film.My Life: Queen of the Court 2nd Editionby Serena WilliamsMy Life Explosive and revealing autobiography from one of the most successful and popular women tennis players of the modern era.Venus and Serena: Serving from the Hip: 10 Rules for Living, Loving, and Winningby Serena Williams, Beard Hilary, and Venus WilliamsThese superstars and super sisters share their secrets in this straight-talking smart guide.

From the beginning of his life, Richard’s mother taught him to live by the principles of courage, confidence, commitment, faith, and love.He passed the same qualities on to his daughters, who grew up loving their father and valuing the lessons he taught them. “I still feel really close to my father,” says Serena. “We have a great relationship. There is an appreciation. There is a closeness because of what we’ve been through together, and a respect.”A self-made man, Williams has walked a long, hard, exciting, and ultimately rewarding road during his life, surmounting many challenges to raise a loving family and two of the greatest tennis players who ever lived.Black and Whiteis the extraordinary story of that journey and the indomitable spirit that made it all possible.Serena Williams: Tennis Champion, Sports Legend, and Cultural Heroineby Merlisa Lawrence CorbettMore than a biography, Serena Williams: Tennis Champion, Sports Legend, and Cultural Heroine not only tells the story of her upbringing and remarkable career but also looks at Williams as a sports pioneer.Merlisa Lawrence Corbett explores Williams’ influence on cultural and political issues such as body shaming, gender equality, and racism in sports and society.

WILLIAMS: That's my little sister, guys.(LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Ladies and gentlemen, our champion, the legendary Serena Williams.(APPLAUSE)S. WILLIAMS: She's the only reason I'm standing here today and the only reason that the Williams sisters exist. So thank you, Venus, for inspiring me.(APPLAUSE)GARCIA-NAVARRO: Serena Williams beat her big sister, Venus, on Saturday to win the Australian Open. It's her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, a new record. In this week's edition of Out Of Bounds, our ongoing conversation about sports and culture, we talk with Clinton Yates. He's a writer for the ESPN website The Undefeated and penned an intensely personal essay about how he came to admit that Serena is his favorite athlete of all time.Thanks for coming here.CLINTON YATES: Anytime.GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to talk about this article which caught our eye. You wrote that it took you years to be able to say this out loud. Say it. What is it?YATES: Serena Williams is my favorite athlete of all time.GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK (laughter), tell us, why was it so hard for you, as a man, to admire a woman athlete?YATES: I think there's two reasons. No. 1, is that as somebody that grew up - you know, I played three sports in high school. I played soccer. I played basketball. I played baseball. So my entire, sort of, psychological link to what I cared about in sports was very much toward, No. 1, those sports and No. 2, people who I saw who I felt were better at team games.But I also think that too many athletes are so caught up, from an identity standpoint, in one thing or another thing - whether it's being a woman, whether it's being black or whether it's being someone who's not American. In this case, Serena obviously is American. But you know how sometimes there's something that you like and you keep returning to it and you don't really have a reason why? And then something happens and you're like - wow, I know a lot more about that than I cared to realize.And it was when she last won Wimbledon, and I just looked at myself, and I said - I don't know that there's another person I'd rather watch play sports. And that's all I do for a living, you know what I mean? And...GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was the moment for you?YATES: That was the moment for me. It was the last Wimbledon where I said - wow, not only is she my favorite athlete from a standpoint of playing the game, but I am here for the fashion. I am here for what she does off the court. I am here for her eloquence and intelligence and personal standards. The situation that happened at Indian Wells - she didn't play there for years because she felt it was a racist location, and she was not going to deal with that.GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to come back to this idea of you - obviously - as a man, making this admission about a woman athlete. What has been the reaction when you talked about this on Twitter, when you've talked about this publicly? What has been the reaction among other men?YATES: The first reaction I got to that was some guy said, I'm having a hard time imagining you wearing a tennis skirt, which instantly indicated to me where most people are at, from a guy's standpoint, when it comes to what they think about women. They are ultimately just objects of desire or of their gaze. So a lot of guys, for me, reacted - oh, come on, how could you say something like that? And it's like well, you know, sorry, dude - I don't look at all women as sex objects, No. 1. And No. 2, I don't view all things that women do in athletic context as lesser than.And that - those two things right there are more than most men are not only willing to do but need to do. That's the problem. You know, this is what toxic masculinity and patriarchy bring to you in society - is that if you don't have to do that, you will not do that. And so once I, you know, made that personal growth point, which was 10, 15 odd years ago, you know, it's not hard for me to say that.GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what did you think of the match?YATES: The grace that they showed toward each other, the actual competitiveness that they show on the court, it's really, really something to see. And if you haven't gotten a chance to watch it, it's worth watching the fullness of the match from entrance to exit, not just the part where they're hitting the tennis balls because their relationship is so special like that.GARCIA-NAVARRO: Clinton Yates is a writer for The Undefeated. Thanks.YATES: Pas de quoi.Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

She now returns to the No. 1 spot after losing that ranking in September to Angelique Kerber.Despite an intense game in the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, the two sisters were all smiles and compliments in the post-match ceremony."There's no way I could be at 23 without her," Serena, 35, said of her sister. "Thank you Venus for inspiring me to be the best player I can be."The Two-WayNadal Books Date With Federer For Australian Open Title"Serena Williams. That's my little sister, guys," Venus said. "Your win has always been my win."The last time the two sisters faced off for the Australian Open was in 2003, which resulted in a win for Serena. She now has a 17-11 career record against Venus, which includes a record of 10-5 of Grand Slams, The Associated Press reports.With a combined age of 71, the sisters made up the oldest women's Grand Slam final. At 36, Venus was the oldest Grand Slam finalist in 23 years."I really elevated my game somehow," Serena told ESPN afterward, saying she still thinks she's in the prime of her career. "I really wanted to get to 23 so bad, more than you can imagine" she added.The Australian Open continues Sunday, when Roger Federer is scheduled to face off against Rafael Nadal in the men's final.FacebookTwitterFlipboardEmailRead & ListenHomeNewsCultureMusicPodcasts & ShowsConnectNewslettersFacebookTwitterInstagramPressContact & HelpAbout NPROverviewDiversityAccessibilityEthicsFinancesPublic EditorCorrectionsGet InvolvedSupport Public RadioSponsor NPRNPR CareersNPR ShopNPR EventsNPR ExtraTerms of UsePrivacyYour Privacy ChoicesText OnlySponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

"It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me.” Balenciaga gown. Bulgari High Jewelry earring.Photographed by Luis Alberto Rodriguez,Vogue, September 2022.MagazineSerena Williams Says Farewell to Tennis On Her Own Terms—And In Her Own WordsBySerena WilliamsAs told toRob HaskellPhotography byLuis Alberto RodriguezStyled byGabriella Karefa-JohnsonAugust 9, 2022FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryFacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryThis morning, my daughter, Olympia, who turns five this month, and I were on our way to get her a new passport before a trip to Europe. We’re in my car, and she’s holding my phone, using an interactive educational app she likes. This robot voice asks her a question: What do you want to be when you grow up? She doesn’t know I’m listening, but I can hear the answer she whispers into the phone. She says, “I want to be a big sister.”STANDING TALLSergio Hudson dress. Fernando Jorge earring.Fashion Editor: Gabriella Karefa-Johnson.Olympia says this a lot, even when she knows I’m listening. Sometimes before bed, she prays to Jehovah to bring her a baby sister. (She doesn’t want anything to do with a boy!) I’m the youngest of five sisters myself, and my sisters are my heroes, so this has felt like a moment I need to listen very carefully to.Believe me, I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don’t think it’s fair. If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family. Maybe I’d be more of a Tom Brady if I had that opportunity. Don’t get me wrong: I love being a woman, and I loved every second of being pregnant with Olympia. I was one of those annoying women who adored being pregnant and was working until the day I had to report to the hospital—although things got super complicated on the other side. And I almost did do the impossible: A lot of people don’t realize that I was two months pregnant when I won the Australian Open in 2017. But I’m turning 41 this month, and something’s got to give.I’ve been reluctant to admit that I have to move on from playing tennis. It’s like a taboo topic. It comes up, and I start to cry. I think the only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapistI have never liked the wordretirement.It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me. I’ve been thinking of this as a transition, but I want to be sensitive about how I use that word, which means something very specific and important to a community of people. Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to isevolution.I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me. A few years ago I quietly started Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm. Soon after that, I started a family. I want to grow that family.But I’ve been reluctant to admit to myself or anyone else that I have to move on from playing tennis. Alexis, my husband, and I have hardly talked about it; it’s like a taboo topic. I can’t even have this conversation with my mom and dad. It’s like it’s not real until you say it out loud. It comes up, I get an uncomfortable lump in my throat, and I start to cry. The only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapist! One thing I’m not going to do is sugarcoat this. I know that a lot of people are excited about and look forward to retiring, and I really wish I felt that way. Ashleigh Barty was number one in the world when she left the sport this March, and I believe she really felt ready to move on. Caroline Wozniacki, who is one of my best friends, felt a sense of relief when she retired in 2020.LIVING LEGENDSPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz with sister Venus Williams inVogue, May 1998.Praise to these people, but I’m going to be honest. There is no happiness in this topic for me. I know it’s not the usual thing to say, but I feel a great deal of pain. It’s the hardest thing that I could ever imagine. I hate it. I hate that I have to be at this crossroads. I keep saying to myself, I wish it could be easy for me, but it’s not. I’m torn: I don’t want it to be over, but at the same time I’m ready for what’s next. I don’t know how I’m going to be able to look at this magazine when it comes out, knowing that this is it, the end of a story that started in Compton, California, with a little Black girl who just wanted to play tennis. This sport has given me so much. I love to win. I love the battle. I love to entertain. I’m not sure every player sees it that way, but I love the performance aspect of it—to be able to entertain people week after week. Some of the happiest times in my life were spent waiting in that hallway in Melbourne, and walking out into Rod Laver Arena with my earphones in and trying to stay focused and drown out the noise but still feeling the energy of the crowd. Night matches in Arthur Ashe Stadium at Flushing Meadows. Hitting an ace on set point.My whole life, up to now, has been tennis. My dad says I first picked up a racket when I was three, but I think it was even earlier. There’s a picture of Venus pushing me in a stroller on a tennis court, and I couldn’t have been more than 18 months. Unlike Venus, who’s always been stoic and classy, I’ve never been one to contain my emotions. I remember learning to write my alphabet for kindergarten and not doing it perfectly and crying all night. I was so angry about it. I’d erase and rewrite thatAover and over, and my mother let me stay up all night while my sisters were in bed. That’s always been me. I want to be great. I want to be perfect. I know perfect doesn’t exist, but whatever my perfect was, I never wanted to stop until I got it right.To me that’s kind of the essence of being Serena: expecting the best from myself and proving people wrong. There were so many matches I won because something made me angry or someone counted me out. That drove me. I’ve built a career on channeling anger and negativity and turning it into something good. My sister Venus once said that when someone out there says you can’t do something, it is because they can’t do it. But I did do it. And so can you.POWER PLAYERPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz inVogue, April 2003.If you watchedKing Richard,then you know that when I was little, I was not very good at tennis. I was so sad when I didn’t get all the early opportunities that Venus got, but that helped me. It made me work harder, turning me into a savage fighter. I’d travel to tournaments with Venus as her hitting partner, and if there was an open slot, I’d play. I followed her around the world and watched her. When she lost, I understood why, and I made sure I wouldn’t lose the same way. That’s how I started to move so fast up the rankings, because I learned the lessons from Venus’s losses instead of the hard way, from my own. It was as if I were playing her matches, too. I’m a good mimic. Growing up I tried to copy Pete Sampras. I loved Monica Seles, and then I studied Monica Seles. I watched, I listened, then I attacked. But if I hadn’t been in Venus’s shadow, I would never be who I am. When someone said I was just the little sister, that’s when I got really fired up.I started playing tennis with the goal of winning the U.S. Open. I didn’t think past that. And then I just kept winning. I remember when I passed Martina Hingis’s grand slam count. Then Seles’s. And then I tied Billie Jean King, who is such an inspiration for me because of how she has pioneered gender equality in all sports. Then it was climbing over the Chris Evert–Martina Navratilova mountain. There are people who say I’m not the GOAT because I didn’t pass Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam titles, which she achieved before the “open era” that began in 1968. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want that record. Obviously I do. But day to day, I’m really not thinking about her. If I’m in a grand slam final, then yes, I am thinking about that record. Maybe I thought about it too much, and that didn’t help. The way I see it, I should have had 30-plus grand slams. I had my chances after coming back from giving birth. I went from a C-section to a second pulmonary embolism to a grand slam final. I played while breastfeeding. I played through postpartum depression. But I didn’t get there. Shoulda, woulda, coulda. I didn’t show up the way I should have or could have. But I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine. Actually it’s extraordinary. But these days, if I have to choose between building my tennis résumé and building my family, I choose the latter.QUEEN OF THE COURTPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz inVogue, April 2015.Earlier in my career, I never thought about having kids. There were times when I’ve wondered if I should ever bring kids into this world, with all its problems. I was never that confident or comfortable around babies or children, and I figured that if I ever did have a baby, I would have people taking care of it 24/7. I’m not going to lie—I definitely have a lot of support. But I’m also an incredibly hands-on mother. My husband will tell you I am too hands-on. In five years, Olympia has only spent one 24-hour period away from me. This past year, while I was recovering from a hamstring injury, I got to pick her up from school four or five days a week, and I always looked forward to seeing her face light up when she walked out of the building and saw me waiting there for her. The fact is that nothing is a sacrifice for me when it comes to Olympia. It all just makes sense. I want to teach her how to tie her shoes, how to read, where babies come from, and about God. Just like my mom taught me. As she grows, it’s something different every month. Lately she’s been into watching baking shows, which we do together. Now we bake with Play-Doh, which is so much fun. She loves this game called The Floor Is Lava, where you have to do whatever you can to avoid touching the ground. I love setting up my gym for the game, arranging my step-up boxes and weight machines like an obstacle course. Whatever she likes, I like.AT EASE“I want to be great. I want to be perfect. I know perfect doesn’t exist, but whatevermy perfect was, I never wanted to stop until I got it right.” Ralph Lauren Collection dress.MOTHER LOVE“I’m an incredibly hands-on mother. Nothing is a sacrifice when it comes to Olympia. It all just makes sense.” Danielle Frankel gown.I think tennis, by comparison, has always felt like a sacrifice—though it’s one I enjoyed making. When you’re younger, you see kids having fun, and you want to do that stuff but you know you have to be on the court, hoping that one day it will all pay off. I got pushed hard by my parents. Nowadays so many parents say, “Let your kids do what they want!” Well, that’s not what got me where I am. I didn’t rebel as a kid. I worked hard, and I followed the rules. I do want to push Olympia—not in tennis, but in whatever captures her interest. But I don’t want to push too hard. I’m still trying to figure out that balance.In my own life, the balance has been slowly shifting toward Serena Ventures. I always say that I’m a sponge: At night I go to bed and I squeeze myself out so that the next day I can take up as much new information as I can. Every morning, I’m so excited to walk downstairs to my office and jump onto Zooms and start reviewing decks of companies we’re considering investing in. We’re a small but growing firm of six people scattered between Florida, where I mainly live, Texas, and California. I started investing nine years ago, and I really fell in love with early stage, whether it’s pre-seed funding, where you’re investing in just an idea, or seed, where the idea has already been turned into a product. I wrote one of the very first checks for MasterClass. It’s one of 16 unicorns—companies valued at more than $1 billion—that Serena Ventures has funded, along with Tonal, Impossible Foods, Noom, and Esusu, to name a few. This year we raised $111 million of outside financing, from banks, private individuals, and family offices. Seventy-​eight percent of our portfolio happens to be companies started by women and people of color, because that’s who we are. On the other hand, my husband is white, and it’s important to me to be inclusive of everyone. Serena Ventures has been an all-female business until recently, when we brought in our first guy—a diversity hire!FEELING GRAND“I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine. Actually it’s extraordinary.” Wales Bonner dress. Lagos chain necklace. Dezso by Sara Beltran pendant.A few years ago, I was at a conference organized by JPMorgan Chase, where I watched a talk between Jamie Dimon and Caryn Seidman-Becker, the CEO of the security company Clear. Caryn explained that less than 2 percent of all VC money went to women. I figured that she misspoke. I thought, There’s no way that 98 percent of that capital is going to men. I approached her afterward, and she confirmed it. I kind of understood then and there that someone who looks like me needs to start writing the big checks. Sometimes like attracts like. Men are writing those big checks to one another, and in order for us to change that, more people who look like me need to be in that position, giving money back to themselves. I’m so grateful to women like Caryn, as well as Sheryl Sandberg and others who have mentored me. It’s important to have women like that who believe in you and push you to think bigger and do bigger.I’d like to think that thanks to me, women athletes can be themselves. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it allIn the last year, Alexis and I have been trying to have another child, and we recently got some information from my doctor that put my mind at ease and made me feel that whenever we’re ready, we can add to our family. I definitely don’t want to be pregnant again as an athlete. I need to be two feet into tennis or two feet out.This spring, I had the itch to get back on the court for the first time in seven months. I was talking to Tiger Woods, who’s a friend, and I told him I needed his advice on my tennis career. I said, “I don’t know what to do: I think I’m over it, but maybe I’m not over it.” He’s Tiger, and he was adamant that I be a beast the same way he is! He said, “Serena, what if you just gave it two weeks? You don’t have to commit to anything. You just go out on the court every day for two weeks and give it your all and see what happens.” I said, “All right, I think I can do that.” And I didn’t do it. But a month later, I gave it a try. And it felt magical to pick up a racket again. And I was good. I was really good. I went back and forth about whether to play Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open after that. As I’ve said, this whole evolution thing has not been easy for me.I don’t particularly like to think about my legacy. I get asked about it a lot, and I never know exactly what to say. But I’d like to think that thanks to opportunities afforded to me, women athletes feel that they can be themselves on the court. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can be strong yet beautiful. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it all. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career. Mistakes are learning experiences, and I embrace those moments. I’m far from perfect, but I’ve also taken a lot of criticism, and I’d like to think that I went through some hard times as a professional tennis player so that the next generation could have it easier. Over the years, I hope that people come to think of me as symbolizing something bigger than tennis. I admire Billie Jean because she transcended her sport. I’d like it to be: Serena is this and she’s thatandshe was a great tennis playerandshe won those slams.Unfortunately I wasn’t ready to win Wimbledon this year. And I don’t know if I will be ready to win New York. But I’m going to try. And the lead-up tournaments will be fun. I know there’s a fan fantasy that I might have tied Margaret that day in London, then maybe beat her record in New York, and then at the trophy ceremony say, “See ya!” I get that. It’s a good fantasy. But I’m not looking for some ceremonial, final on-court moment. I’m terrible at goodbyes, the world’s worst. But please know that I am more grateful for you than I can ever express in words. You have carried me to so many wins and so many trophies. I’m going to miss that version of me, that girl who played tennis. And I’m going to miss you.HAPPY DAYSGucci Exquisite MTO gown.

It meant a lot to me," Williams tellsCNBC Make It."It's about change and I'm not good with change."From the time Williams was a child, her life had been very regimented thanks to tennis."I remember in the summer, we would train from, I think it was from like 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and then 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.," Williams, now 38, toldMasterClass.com. "And then on Saturdays, we would train from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and then we would have Sundays off."So Williams, who washome-schooledalong with her sister Venus to accommodate their tennis practice and tournaments, struggled at times to adapt to her new reality."I like a routine sometimes and do the same thing," Williams says."I like things the way they are and I don't like to change them. So ["Who Moved my Cheese"] talks about that and it was really good for me to read."In the book, four characters are in a maze in search of cheese. The cheese is a metaphor for whatever you want to find in life, whether its a job, money or happiness. After finding a spot in the maze with abundant cheese, the characters develop routines around that cheese. But when the cheese runs out, the characters have to find new cheese. ("Who moved my cheese?" one character asks.) Those who venture out into the maze and learn to adapt along the way find new cheese, and those who are scared and angry and refuse to go further into the maze do not."It would be all so easy if you had a map to the Maze. If the same old routines worked. If they'd just stop moving 'The Cheese.' But things keep changing," the book says. In other words, dealing with change is inevitable, but how you handle it is up to you.Like this story?Like CNBC Make It on Facebook.Don't miss:From 'The Alchemist' to 'Blink': Books that Kobe Bryant loved to readSerena Williams: 'I am the most boring spender'—but this is one thing she'll splurge onShaquille O'Neal says he wants to buy ReebokVIDEO0:2700:27Bill Gates talks about Apple's Macintosh computer in 1983Make ItStay in the loopGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inboxSign UpAbout UsLearn more about the world of CNBC Make ItLearn MoreFollow UsCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel©2023CNBC LLC.

Only a handful.Regardless, many also believe that the 23-time Grand Slam champion never went to college. Considering that she turned professional at 15, this fits right into her story.

WILLIAMS: That's my little sister, guys.(LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Ladies and gentlemen, our champion, the legendary Serena Williams.(APPLAUSE)S. WILLIAMS: She's the only reason I'm standing here today and the only reason that the Williams sisters exist. So thank you, Venus, for inspiring me.(APPLAUSE)GARCIA-NAVARRO: Serena Williams beat her big sister, Venus, on Saturday to win the Australian Open. It's her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, a new record. In this week's edition of Out Of Bounds, our ongoing conversation about sports and culture, we talk with Clinton Yates. He's a writer for the ESPN website The Undefeated and penned an intensely personal essay about how he came to admit that Serena is his favorite athlete of all time.Thanks for coming here.CLINTON YATES: Anytime.GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to talk about this article which caught our eye. You wrote that it took you years to be able to say this out loud. Say it. What is it?YATES: Serena Williams is my favorite athlete of all time.GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK (laughter), tell us, why was it so hard for you, as a man, to admire a woman athlete?YATES: I think there's two reasons. No. 1, is that as somebody that grew up - you know, I played three sports in high school. I played soccer. I played basketball. I played baseball. So my entire, sort of, psychological link to what I cared about in sports was very much toward, No. 1, those sports and No. 2, people who I saw who I felt were better at team games.But I also think that too many athletes are so caught up, from an identity standpoint, in one thing or another thing - whether it's being a woman, whether it's being black or whether it's being someone who's not American. In this case, Serena obviously is American. But you know how sometimes there's something that you like and you keep returning to it and you don't really have a reason why? And then something happens and you're like - wow, I know a lot more about that than I cared to realize.And it was when she last won Wimbledon, and I just looked at myself, and I said - I don't know that there's another person I'd rather watch play sports. And that's all I do for a living, you know what I mean? And...GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was the moment for you?YATES: That was the moment for me. It was the last Wimbledon where I said - wow, not only is she my favorite athlete from a standpoint of playing the game, but I am here for the fashion. I am here for what she does off the court. I am here for her eloquence and intelligence and personal standards. The situation that happened at Indian Wells - she didn't play there for years because she felt it was a racist location, and she was not going to deal with that.GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to come back to this idea of you - obviously - as a man, making this admission about a woman athlete. What has been the reaction when you talked about this on Twitter, when you've talked about this publicly? What has been the reaction among other men?YATES: The first reaction I got to that was some guy said, I'm having a hard time imagining you wearing a tennis skirt, which instantly indicated to me where most people are at, from a guy's standpoint, when it comes to what they think about women. They are ultimately just objects of desire or of their gaze. So a lot of guys, for me, reacted - oh, come on, how could you say something like that? And it's like well, you know, sorry, dude - I don't look at all women as sex objects, No. 1.

That's the problem. You know, this is what toxic masculinity and patriarchy bring to you in society - is that if you don't have to do that, you will not do that. And so once I, you know, made that personal growth point, which was 10, 15 odd years ago, you know, it's not hard for me to say that.GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what did you think of the match?YATES: The grace that they showed toward each other, the actual competitiveness that they show on the court, it's really, really something to see. And if you haven't gotten a chance to watch it, it's worth watching the fullness of the match from entrance to exit, not just the part where they're hitting the tennis balls because their relationship is so special like that.GARCIA-NAVARRO: Clinton Yates is a writer for The Undefeated.

She now returns to the No. 1 spot after losing that ranking in September to Angelique Kerber.Despite an intense game in the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, the two sisters were all smiles and compliments in the post-match ceremony."There's no way I could be at 23 without her," Serena, 35, said of her sister. "Thank you Venus for inspiring me to be the best player I can be."The Two-WayNadal Books Date With Federer For Australian Open Title"Serena Williams. That's my little sister, guys," Venus said. "Your win has always been my win."The last time the two sisters faced off for the Australian Open was in 2003, which resulted in a win for Serena. She now has a 17-11 career record against Venus, which includes a record of 10-5 of Grand Slams, The Associated Press reports.With a combined age of 71, the sisters made up the oldest women's Grand Slam final. At 36, Venus was the oldest Grand Slam finalist in 23 years."I really elevated my game somehow," Serena told ESPN afterward, saying she still thinks she's in the prime of her career. "I really wanted to get to 23 so bad, more than you can imagine" she added.The Australian Open continues Sunday, when Roger Federer is scheduled to face off against Rafael Nadal in the men's final.FacebookTwitterFlipboardEmailRead & ListenHomeNewsCultureMusicPodcasts & ShowsConnectNewslettersFacebookTwitterInstagramPressContact & HelpAbout NPROverviewDiversityAccessibilityEthicsFinancesPublic EditorCorrectionsGet InvolvedSupport Public RadioSponsor NPRNPR CareersNPR ShopNPR EventsNPR ExtraTerms of UsePrivacyYour Privacy ChoicesText OnlySponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

With 39 Grand Slam titles in total, she's one of the most decorated tennis players of all time.Getting to GOAT status obviously requires years and years of training and perfecting your craft, but there are so many more moving parts that go into it, too—the right team,the right gear, and more importantly, the right diet.More From Women's Healthplay iconThe triangle icon that indicates to playSerena looks at food as fuel. "My philosophy is eat to live. Don't live to eat," she tellsWomen's Healthduring aNintendo gamingevent. "I want to have a healthy lifestyle and, so you know, [I'm eating] a lot of greens and mostly plant-based lately, just super healthy stuff."Related StorySerena Williams And Daughter Honor Flo-JoShe says that this philosophy allows her to see food as a complement, and not her entire life. "You need it to survive. And [that's] very hard to live by, cause I definitely love to snack, but this is what I want. These are my goals."This content is imported from poll. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.Though she has access to plenty of prepared meals to help her meet those healthy goals, Serena also doesn't mind throwing down in the kitchen when she can. "Ilove cooking. I don't have a ton of time to do it often, but I love cooking and it's just kind of relaxing for me."So if you're wondering exactly what Serena eats on the reg, here's what her daily menu looks like.BreakfastEven though Serena likes to stick to a plant-based diet, she occasionally eats eggs in the morning. But she really isn't a huge breakfast person."I often don't make breakfast because I just forget or I'm running around getting Olympia ready," she says. "And then I go work out." She prefers waiting until she's hungry to have her first meal. And for her, that's typically not until later in the day. "When I roll out of bed [in the morning], I'm just not hungry."View full post on InstagramLunchIt depends on what she feels like that day, but her mid-day meal usually involves greens and protein. "I had a bean burger the other day today. [Before our interview], I had a gluten-free bean burrito," Serena says.Related StorySerena Williams On Confidence & Sweat-Proof LinerThere are two things you won't find on her plate, though: beef and avocados. She's never really liked either.DinnerWhat she eats for dinner also depends on what she and her fam feel like eating. But she's a fan of Taco Tuesdays. And just like you or me, she turns to social media for meal-planning inspo. "I get inspired by what I see on Instagram," she says, "and I love making it."She's already mastered chia seed pudding, chocolate cake, and this impressive rainbow cake:View full post on InstagramPre-GameWhen it comes to fueling before her matches, it's all about carb-loading the night before with foods like rice or pasta."The only time I eat pasta is when I'm playing/training. Usually, you'll never see me eating pasta otherwise. 'Cause I feel like I've had to eat it so much in my career. It's just like, I never want to see pasta again," she says jokingly.Her diet actually has a distinct personality.  "I can have a smoothie for six months," she says. "And then I'll be like, I never want to see a smoothie again for the next six months. And then I'll be like, okay, I'm back on the smoothie. My eating is very moody."Related StorySerena Williams And Daughter Honor Flo-JoRight before games, though, she has a go-to plate. "I usually like to have lots of greens before my match and then fruit actually, and a little carbs and some sort of a protein. So I try to knock them [her food groups] all out in one."SnacksSerena says shelovesto snack. She actually toldInsiderthat she's obsessed a certain sweet treat. "I love moon pies. If "Moon Pie" sponsored me, I'd be bigger than any house on this planet! I love the originals: banana, chocolate, or vanilla."View full post on InstagramBut you won't catch her snacking while she's playing with her Nintendo Switch, and for good reason. "My hands are always occupied and there's no way to snack. I mean, I'll lose."Jasmine GomezCommerce EditorJasmine Gomez is the Commerce Editor at Women’s Health, where she cover the best product recommendations across beauty, health, lifestyle, fitness, and more.

But if she was going to have a meal, it would be a "protein and carb" combo like turkey sausage and baked potato.ShutterstockSource:GlamourWhen Williams is away from the court, she might order a delicious and healthy-looking platter for breakfast including smoothies and fruits.Wonderful breakfast at one of my favorite spots #villard.

Everyday I want tacos. I don't know what to do? Is there help for someone that wants to eat tacos everyday?"ShutterstockSource:Facebook.If tacos aren't on the menu and Williams wanted to celebrate a tennis success, she has said she would order a cheese pizza and french fries.ShutterstockSource:GlamourBut sometimes nothing beats home cooking and, for Williams, that means her mother's chicken, rice, and gravy.ShutterstockSource:Bon AppetitIf Williams is doing the cooking, then she likes to wow her friends and family with a number of dishes. "For years I was always making gumbo for everyone," she told Bon Appétit. "My other go-to dishes are something I call a 'seven-bean delight' which really only has five beans, but don't tell. And roasted chicken with garlic."ShutterstockSource:Bon AppetitAside from tacos, there is another food Williams is obsessed with — moon pie. "I love moon pies," she told Bon Appétit.

How to Cook Vegan Like Serena WilliamsSkip to contentJoin UsContactReadJoin UsContactReadDiet & Nutrition>FoodHow to Cook Vegan Like Serena WilliamsSerena Williams isn’t a strict vegan, but she doesn’t like beef and tries to eat plant-based as much as possible. The tennis champion first decided to give a vegan diet a try around a decade ago, thanks to her sister,Venus Williams.As SerenatoldBon Appetit in 2013, she cleaned up her diet and started eating vegan after Venus was diagnosed with an immune system disorder called Sjogren’s syndrome.As one of the most talented athletes in the world, with 39 Grand Slam titles to her name, Serena is very conscious of what she puts in her body. As the Michigan native has discovered, she feels her best when she sticks to a nutritious and largely meat-free eating regimen.“My philosophy is eat to live. Don’t live to eat,” she toldWomen’s Healthin August 2021. “I want to have a healthy lifestyle and, so you know, [I’m eating] a lot of greens and mostly plant-based lately, just super healthy stuff.”To help herself stick to a hearty vegan diet, Serena previously enlisted the help ofplant-based chef Lauren Von der Pool, who cooked for the Williams sisters for several years. While with the Williams sisters, Von der Pool whipped up everything from spinach salad with plum vinegar to plant-based tuna wraps made with walnuts.Even though Serena likely has a hand (or two) in the kitchen, she still enjoys throwing together many of her own (mostly vegan) meals. “I love cooking,” she explained. “I don’t have a ton of time to do it often, but I love cooking and it’s just kind of relaxing for me.”What does Serena Williams Eat?When it comes to vegan food, Serena is partial to plant-based versions of tasty staples such as tacos and pizza, which are often both topped with walnut meat. While she certainly enjoys food, as an elite athlete she views it as fuel more than anything else.“You need [food] to survive,” she toldWomen’s Health. “And that’s very hard to live by, because I definitely love to snack, but this is what I want. These are my goals.”Serena occasionally talks about some of her favorite vegan dishes and recipes in various interviews. She also shares some of her meat-free creations on social media, particularly on her Instagram. Serena is fond of popular dishes that are easy to make, and also loves hearty vegan smoothies and dishes that use plant-based meat substitutes. Here are some of Serena Williams’ favorite vegan recipes.Walnut ‘meat’ tacosOne of Serena’s favorite meals, courtesy of Von der Pool, is her “Grand Slammin’ Tacos” which include vegan “meat” made out of nuts mixed with a flavorful seasoning blend that features cumin, paprika, and more.Serena has even made the Mexican staple on her own, as shesharedwithUSA Todayin June 2013. “I used different nuts and it was delicious. I used a soft shell taco, cashews, walnuts, and sunflower seeds,” she said at the time. “I put them in a mixer. You soak the nuts overnight and after you mix them you put them in the dehydrator. After that, I add seasoning, so it actually tastes like meat.”Serena Williams is a big fan of nutritious smoothies. | billnoll/iStockFruit and veggie smoothiesTo ensure that Serena was getting the nutrients she needed to succeed on the court, Von der Pool whipped up nutritious vegan smoothies and tossed plenty of hearty veggies in the drinks as a way to “trick” the tennis pro, though they took a little getting used to.“When I first started, Serena would pour out the green juices into the plants and act like she was drinking it. Serena is so funny, she’s the absolute best, but she’s just also like a mischievous child,” Von der Pool previously told LIVEKINDLY.More recently, Serena has taken to making nutritious smoothies on her own. During that chat withBon Appétit, the athlete noted that her refrigerator is packed with vegan smoothie staples such as “coconut water, Gatorade (my favorite!), cucumbers, mint, kale, vegetables, ginger, and wheatgrass.” Yum!Bean burgers are a protein-packed veggie classic. | KatieSik/iStockBean burgersPerWomen’s Health, Serena’s mid-day meal usually involves greens and protein. “I had a bean burger the other day,” she told the publication, adding that she instead opted to eat a “gluten-free bean burrito,” days later.While it’s clear that Serena has a penchant for Mexican food (uh, who doesn’t?) her Mexican dishes won’t ever include beef or avocado, as she’s never really liked either ingredient.Greens with fruitBefore a game, Serena typically stays away from any meat or animal products, but she still manages to have a healthy and balanced meal. “I usually like to have lots of greens before my match and then fruit actually, and a little carbs and some sort of a protein,” she shared. “So I try to knock them [the food groups] all out in one.”Serena Williams makes pizza with nut-based meat toppings. | Marat Musabirov/iStockPizzaIn one of her first-ever Instagram posts, Serena proved she can throw together a delectable vegan meal all on her own. “Mexican vegan pizza I made from scratch,” she captioned a snapshot of two pizza pies fresh from the oven. “Meat is actually nut-based.”By the looks of it, the pizzas were also topped with tomato sauce, vegan cheese shreds, and some mushrooms.Vegan fish dishesVegan fish dishes aren’t yet as popular as meals made with plant-based meat substitutes, but that doesn’t mean you can’t make a fish dish without using any real fish. In fact,  Von der Pool recalled she often threw together vegan fish dishes for Serena such as sushi and a plant-based tuna wrap made with walnuts.Samantha LefflerJoin the waitlist for updates and premium membership opportunities.Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Sign UpJoin UsSign up for updates and membership opportunities.Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Sign UpJoin UsSign up for updates and membership opportunities.Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Sign UpJoin UsSign up for updates and membership opportunities.Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Sign UpCopyright 2023 ©LIVEKINDLYJoin UsContactReadWooCommerce not Found

On the court the American is the ultimate competitor, a fighter to the death. Off the court she gives the impression of a half-hearted dabbler without the commitment to see a project through.Williams admits she has a "remarkable ability to waste time" and can idle away hours surfing the internet. She has tried her hand at fashion designing and acting and now wants to write. She has plans for a "dramedy", mixing comedy and drama. Sister Venus has even bought her a book called Writing a TV Drama Series.There is only one problem. "In my mind I've been saying I want to write, but I haven't actually physically picked up a pencil and started writing," Serena confessed recently. "That is my next challenge, to actually sit down and do it. I don't know why I haven't started it yet. I have these unbelievable dreams. I need to write about them. I need to write an episode in this 'dramedy' to get them in. I've got the book on how to write it. I've been reading the book so maybe I now have just to start writing it."It is much the same with her collection of Stratocaster guitars. "I have five guitars, all Strats – I love Strats," Williams said. "I have one in baby blue, two blacks, one red, one wood-coloured." So how often does she play? "Not often, not as much as I used to. I used to have an acoustic, which I played more. But with my long nails now it's impossible to play my guitar. I won't cut my nails."I used to always jam with some other people in a band. We could never find a drummer, but we used to jam together. Venus played the bass, I'd play the guitar. Sometimes I'd play the bass, she'd play the guitar. We played lots of rock music, punk. Venus did more alternative stuff. It was fun."Nowadays Williams tends only to listen, either on her iPod – provided she can find it – or on her computer. "I lose my iPod every day," she said. "I don't have one at the moment because I lost it, just after I had bought it. On a plane I probably read and watch movies more than listen to music. I mostly listen to music in my room. If I'm just relaxing I have the music playing. I play it on the sound system on my HP computer."Music is important to me. It just takes you to a different place. I've read that Michael Phelps listens to music every day to get himself abbed up. Most players listen to music before they go out on the court."Does she use music before matches? "It depends. I did it one year and I didn't do it another year. I think that was because I lost and then I got mad. I obviously do it when I'm working out. I have my MP3 player. I use it to warm up. Sometimes I do dances before a match."What would she listen to before a match? "I have a playlist. I listen to some songs that keep me motivated, keep me abbed up. One is a Green Day song. I also listen to some Beyoncé. She seems to be so abbed with her music. I listen to a lot of hip-hop."As she prepares for her 10th Wimbledon, starting tomorrow, Williams might wonder whether to add Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive" to her playlist. The 16 seeds in Williams' debut year at Wimbledon in 1998 included Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Jana Novotna and Anna Kournikova, while only two of the seeds, Venus Williams and Patty Schnyder, are still playing today.Three years ago, when Serena missed the French Open and Wimbledon, there was speculation about her own future. Even when she won the 2007 Australian Open she was clearly short of her best physical shape, having played just five tournaments in the previous 16 months.At 27, however, she has just enjoyed her most successful 12 months since 2003, when she completed the "Serena Slam" – holding all four Grand Slam titles at the same time. Reaching last year's Wimbledon final was the start of a run that saw her win the US and Australian Open titles and regain the world No1 ranking she had last held five years previously. She has 10 Grand Slam titles and she is hungry for more.Serena needs hard work to stay in shape. She thinks she has never been fitter than this year, thanks in part to her winter training. "I was in Florida and a little bored – a big change from LA," she said. "I just trained with Venus [pictured with Serena, above] and my Dad in Florida. I practised a little more than I normally do. Florida's a little boring. There's nothing to do there. Every day I felt like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. I couldn't wait to get to Australia. Maybe that's why I won: because I didn't want to go back."It was a lot more focused for me in Florida. I'm on a great regime now – in LA as well. And being around Venus and seeing her work hard makes me want to do better and work harder. I have to work hard. I'm lazy. But the older I'm getting the more I'm enjoying hard work. I've realised that my job is to stay fit – and that's a pretty good job to have. I'm not a natural-born person who wants to go to the gym. That's not me."Does Venus bully her into working harder? "No, she just always says: 'Well, I did this, this and this.' It makes me want to say: 'Well, I did this, this, this and this.' So it was good. We were able to motivate each other."For years the sisters seemed to hate playing each other. Their matches were often poor and there were suggestions – strenuously denied – that they took it in turns to win. Over the years, however, their contests have become gripping. Last year's Wimbledon final, which Venus won 7-5 6-4, was memorable, while their US Open quarter-final, which Serena won 7-6 7-6, was arguably the best women's match of the year, full of wonderful athleticism and ball-striking."I think our matches have got a little better," Serena said. "We've got better as well, so that has made the quality of the match better, and our games have got closer. At one point she was dominating me and then I was winning. Now we're really neck and neck [they have won 10 matches each]. I think that has something to do with it as well."As for her own game, she believes she is a more complete player. How would the 2009 Serena fare against the 2003 version? "I think the Serena now would definitely beat the other Serena. I'm older. I think I'm wiser, a more mature player. Back then, it was more nitty-gritty. Now it's more composed and planned-out playing."Serena's recapturing of the world No 1 position – which she has since relinquished to Dinara Safina – was remarkable considering her comparative lack of success on the Sony Ericsson Tour. In almost five years, she has won just four tournaments away from the Grand Slam events. Safina has won six in the last 13 months alone – but has lost three Grand Slam finals along the way.After the Russian became world No 1 earlier this year, Serena was dismissive. "We all know who the real No 1 is," she said. "Quite frankly, I'm the best in the world."She insists, nevertheless, that losing the top spot is no big deal. "It's cool to be No 1, but everyone assumes I'm No 1 anyway," she said. "When I'm at home people come up to me and say: 'You're No 1.' I hadn't been No 1 for ever, but I never corrected them. I just let them assume."It's important, I guess, but at the same time I don't worry about it. I just take things as they go every day. If I'm No 1, great, if not I just try to keep winning the tournaments. It's hard these days to be No 1. You get to the finals of three Grand Slams in a row and you're still barely No 1."Serena concentrates on the Grand Slam tournaments. The Tour have tried to construct a calendar in which the top women all play at certain events, with fines for those who do not turn up, but appearing on court and winning matches are two different matters. Serena has fallen at the first hurdle in her last three tournaments outside the majors, losing to Klara Zakopalova, Schnyder and Francesca Schiavone.In Madrid she retired after one set against Schiavone, having arrived with a knee injury. Asked at a press conference if she would have been better advised to stay away and pay the $75,000 (£46,000) fine she feared, Serena replied: "Do you want to pay it for me? I'm remodelling a house. I don't know about anyone else, but $75,000 is a lot of money to me. That's like my whole furniture bill, some stairs, rugs. That can go a long way. In this economy I'm not in a position to just write out $75,000 cheques."Provided she remains fit, she plans to be around for a while yet. "I just feel like I'm going to play and keep playing," she said. "Right now I don't see an end. Today I actually enjoyed practising for the first time ever. I hate practising. I thought: 'Oh my God, the older I get the more forehands I want to hit.' So I think that's a good sign."And her ambitions for Wimbledon after finishing as runner-up 12 months ago? "My goal is just to do better than last year."Serena's possible path to finalRound 1Neuza Silva (Portugal) Age: 26.

Honestly, she likes playing piano. When she was in my belly, I played a lot of piano music.”The sports star said she has enrolled Olympia – whom she has with her husband Alexis Ohanian – into piano lessons, and the youngster is already teaching her mother how to play.Speaking during an appearance on ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!’, she added: “[She’s been taking lessons] and she’s teaching me! Like, I’m not even kidding. I have a baby Mozart, [but] of course every parent thinks they have like, a baby Beethoven or whatever.”Meanwhile, Serena recently said she wants her daughter to watch the new biographical drama film 'King Richard', which tracks the rise of Serena and her sister Venus Williams, as well as their father Richard.Serena shared: "She gets to see what mommy was like. I always wondered how I would explain my life. Like, how will I even start that conversation? This is the perfect way."The tennis star also revealed that she still considers her sister Venus, 41, to be her "hero", as she said her older sister helped open doors for her in the tennis world.Serena - who started playing tennis when the Williams family were living in Compton, California - explained: "I feel like the film actually tells her story, in a way that no one can ever really tell what she went through in being the first black player to really step out there."You see the impact that it has had and all the people that are coming up after myself and Venus. There would be no Serena if there wasn't a Venus."She was my hero, and she still is my hero. She'll do something and I'm like, 'I'm doing that too.' She's still my hero, she really was able to open the way for me and go through doors.Love0Funny0Wow0Sad0Angry0FacebookTwitterWhatsAppSMSEmailPrintCopy article linkSaveTagsSerena WilliamTennisOlympiaSportMusicMusical InstrumentsCinemaSuperstarVenusDaughterStarKARDASHIANSWEDDING BELLSSPLITSVILLEBABY BUMPSREHABBRANGELINABEY-BIESArticlesArticlesStormy Daniels death threats over Trump revealed: ‘Gonna kill you, gonna kill your family, gonna set fire to your house’Emily Ratajkowski quit acting because she felt 'like a piece of meat'Donald Trump ‘put on DJ set day after his arraignment’Donald Glover plagued by recurring nightmare about being chased by mobs of cops and zombiesWilliam H.

We’re in my car, and she’s holding my phone, using an interactive educational app she likes. This robot voice asks her a question: What do you want to be when you grow up? She doesn’t know I’m listening, but I can hear the answer she whispers into the phone. She says, “I want to be a big sister.”STANDING TALLSergio Hudson dress. Fernando Jorge earring.Fashion Editor: Gabriella Karefa-Johnson.Olympia says this a lot, even when she knows I’m listening. Sometimes before bed, she prays to Jehovah to bring her a baby sister. (She doesn’t want anything to do with a boy!) I’m the youngest of five sisters myself, and my sisters are my heroes, so this has felt like a moment I need to listen very carefully to.Believe me, I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family. I don’t think it’s fair. If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family. Maybe I’d be more of a Tom Brady if I had that opportunity. Don’t get me wrong: I love being a woman, and I loved every second of being pregnant with Olympia. I was one of those annoying women who adored being pregnant and was working until the day I had to report to the hospital—although things got super complicated on the other side. And I almost did do the impossible: A lot of people don’t realize that I was two months pregnant when I won the Australian Open in 2017. But I’m turning 41 this month, and something’s got to give.I’ve been reluctant to admit that I have to move on from playing tennis. It’s like a taboo topic. It comes up, and I start to cry. I think the only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapistI have never liked the wordretirement.It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me. I’ve been thinking of this as a transition, but I want to be sensitive about how I use that word, which means something very specific and important to a community of people. Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to isevolution.I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me. A few years ago I quietly started Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm. Soon after that, I started a family. I want to grow that family.But I’ve been reluctant to admit to myself or anyone else that I have to move on from playing tennis. Alexis, my husband, and I have hardly talked about it; it’s like a taboo topic. I can’t even have this conversation with my mom and dad. It’s like it’s not real until you say it out loud. It comes up, I get an uncomfortable lump in my throat, and I start to cry. The only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapist! One thing I’m not going to do is sugarcoat this. I know that a lot of people are excited about and look forward to retiring, and I really wish I felt that way. Ashleigh Barty was number one in the world when she left the sport this March, and I believe she really felt ready to move on. Caroline Wozniacki, who is one of my best friends, felt a sense of relief when she retired in 2020.LIVING LEGENDSPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz with sister Venus Williams inVogue, May 1998.Praise to these people, but I’m going to be honest. There is no happiness in this topic for me. I know it’s not the usual thing to say, but I feel a great deal of pain. It’s the hardest thing that I could ever imagine. I hate it. I hate that I have to be at this crossroads. I keep saying to myself, I wish it could be easy for me, but it’s not. I’m torn: I don’t want it to be over, but at the same time I’m ready for what’s next. I don’t know how I’m going to be able to look at this magazine when it comes out, knowing that this is it, the end of a story that started in Compton, California, with a little Black girl who just wanted to play tennis. This sport has given me so much. I love to win. I love the battle. I love to entertain. I’m not sure every player sees it that way, but I love the performance aspect of it—to be able to entertain people week after week. Some of the happiest times in my life were spent waiting in that hallway in Melbourne, and walking out into Rod Laver Arena with my earphones in and trying to stay focused and drown out the noise but still feeling the energy of the crowd. Night matches in Arthur Ashe Stadium at Flushing Meadows. Hitting an ace on set point.My whole life, up to now, has been tennis. My dad says I first picked up a racket when I was three, but I think it was even earlier. There’s a picture of Venus pushing me in a stroller on a tennis court, and I couldn’t have been more than 18 months. Unlike Venus, who’s always been stoic and classy, I’ve never been one to contain my emotions. I remember learning to write my alphabet for kindergarten and not doing it perfectly and crying all night. I was so angry about it. I’d erase and rewrite thatAover and over, and my mother let me stay up all night while my sisters were in bed. That’s always been me. I want to be great. I want to be perfect. I know perfect doesn’t exist, but whatever my perfect was, I never wanted to stop until I got it right.To me that’s kind of the essence of being Serena: expecting the best from myself and proving people wrong. There were so many matches I won because something made me angry or someone counted me out. That drove me. I’ve built a career on channeling anger and negativity and turning it into something good. My sister Venus once said that when someone out there says you can’t do something, it is because they can’t do it. But I did do it. And so can you.POWER PLAYERPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz inVogue, April 2003.If you watchedKing Richard,then you know that when I was little, I was not very good at tennis. I was so sad when I didn’t get all the early opportunities that Venus got, but that helped me. It made me work harder, turning me into a savage fighter. I’d travel to tournaments with Venus as her hitting partner, and if there was an open slot, I’d play. I followed her around the world and watched her. When she lost, I understood why, and I made sure I wouldn’t lose the same way. That’s how I started to move so fast up the rankings, because I learned the lessons from Venus’s losses instead of the hard way, from my own. It was as if I were playing her matches, too. I’m a good mimic. Growing up I tried to copy Pete Sampras. I loved Monica Seles, and then I studied Monica Seles. I watched, I listened, then I attacked. But if I hadn’t been in Venus’s shadow, I would never be who I am. When someone said I was just the little sister, that’s when I got really fired up.I started playing tennis with the goal of winning the U.S. Open. I didn’t think past that. And then I just kept winning. I remember when I passed Martina Hingis’s grand slam count. Then Seles’s. And then I tied Billie Jean King, who is such an inspiration for me because of how she has pioneered gender equality in all sports. Then it was climbing over the Chris Evert–Martina Navratilova mountain. There are people who say I’m not the GOAT because I didn’t pass Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam titles, which she achieved before the “open era” that began in 1968. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want that record. Obviously I do. But day to day, I’m really not thinking about her. If I’m in a grand slam final, then yes, I am thinking about that record. Maybe I thought about it too much, and that didn’t help. The way I see it, I should have had 30-plus grand slams. I had my chances after coming back from giving birth. I went from a C-section to a second pulmonary embolism to a grand slam final. I played while breastfeeding. I played through postpartum depression. But I didn’t get there. Shoulda, woulda, coulda. I didn’t show up the way I should have or could have. But I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine. Actually it’s extraordinary. But these days, if I have to choose between building my tennis résumé and building my family, I choose the latter.QUEEN OF THE COURTPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz inVogue, April 2015.Earlier in my career, I never thought about having kids. There were times when I’ve wondered if I should ever bring kids into this world, with all its problems. I was never that confident or comfortable around babies or children, and I figured that if I ever did have a baby, I would have people taking care of it 24/7. I’m not going to lie—I definitely have a lot of support. But I’m also an incredibly hands-on mother. My husband will tell you I am too hands-on. In five years, Olympia has only spent one 24-hour period away from me. This past year, while I was recovering from a hamstring injury, I got to pick her up from school four or five days a week, and I always looked forward to seeing her face light up when she walked out of the building and saw me waiting there for her. The fact is that nothing is a sacrifice for me when it comes to Olympia. It all just makes sense. I want to teach her how to tie her shoes, how to read, where babies come from, and about God. Just like my mom taught me. As she grows, it’s something different every month. Lately she’s been into watching baking shows, which we do together. Now we bake with Play-Doh, which is so much fun. She loves this game called The Floor Is Lava, where you have to do whatever you can to avoid touching the ground. I love setting up my gym for the game, arranging my step-up boxes and weight machines like an obstacle course. Whatever she likes, I like.AT EASE“I want to be great. I want to be perfect.

Nothing is a sacrifice when it comes to Olympia. It all just makes sense.” Danielle Frankel gown.I think tennis, by comparison, has always felt like a sacrifice—though it’s one I enjoyed making. When you’re younger, you see kids having fun, and you want to do that stuff but you know you have to be on the court, hoping that one day it will all pay off. I got pushed hard by my parents. Nowadays so many parents say, “Let your kids do what they want!” Well, that’s not what got me where I am. I didn’t rebel as a kid. I worked hard, and I followed the rules. I do want to push Olympia—not in tennis, but in whatever captures her interest. But I don’t want to push too hard. I’m still trying to figure out that balance.In my own life, the balance has been slowly shifting toward Serena Ventures. I always say that I’m a sponge: At night I go to bed and I squeeze myself out so that the next day I can take up as much new information as I can. Every morning, I’m so excited to walk downstairs to my office and jump onto Zooms and start reviewing decks of companies we’re considering investing in. We’re a small but growing firm of six people scattered between Florida, where I mainly live, Texas, and California. I started investing nine years ago, and I really fell in love with early stage, whether it’s pre-seed funding, where you’re investing in just an idea, or seed, where the idea has already been turned into a product. I wrote one of the very first checks for MasterClass. It’s one of 16 unicorns—companies valued at more than $1 billion—that Serena Ventures has funded, along with Tonal, Impossible Foods, Noom, and Esusu, to name a few. This year we raised $111 million of outside financing, from banks, private individuals, and family offices. Seventy-​eight percent of our portfolio happens to be companies started by women and people of color, because that’s who we are. On the other hand, my husband is white, and it’s important to me to be inclusive of everyone. Serena Ventures has been an all-female business until recently, when we brought in our first guy—a diversity hire!FEELING GRAND“I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine.

Dezso by Sara Beltran pendant.A few years ago, I was at a conference organized by JPMorgan Chase, where I watched a talk between Jamie Dimon and Caryn Seidman-Becker, the CEO of the security company Clear. Caryn explained that less than 2 percent of all VC money went to women. I figured that she misspoke. I thought, There’s no way that 98 percent of that capital is going to men. I approached her afterward, and she confirmed it. I kind of understood then and there that someone who looks like me needs to start writing the big checks. Sometimes like attracts like. Men are writing those big checks to one another, and in order for us to change that, more people who look like me need to be in that position, giving money back to themselves. I’m so grateful to women like Caryn, as well as Sheryl Sandberg and others who have mentored me. It’s important to have women like that who believe in you and push you to think bigger and do bigger.I’d like to think that thanks to me, women athletes can be themselves. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it allIn the last year, Alexis and I have been trying to have another child, and we recently got some information from my doctor that put my mind at ease and made me feel that whenever we’re ready, we can add to our family. I definitely don’t want to be pregnant again as an athlete. I need to be two feet into tennis or two feet out.This spring, I had the itch to get back on the court for the first time in seven months. I was talking to Tiger Woods, who’s a friend, and I told him I needed his advice on my tennis career. I said, “I don’t know what to do: I think I’m over it, but maybe I’m not over it.” He’s Tiger, and he was adamant that I be a beast the same way he is! He said, “Serena, what if you just gave it two weeks? You don’t have to commit to anything. You just go out on the court every day for two weeks and give it your all and see what happens.” I said, “All right, I think I can do that.” And I didn’t do it. But a month later, I gave it a try. And it felt magical to pick up a racket again. And I was good. I was really good. I went back and forth about whether to play Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open after that. As I’ve said, this whole evolution thing has not been easy for me.I don’t particularly like to think about my legacy. I get asked about it a lot, and I never know exactly what to say. But I’d like to think that thanks to opportunities afforded to me, women athletes feel that they can be themselves on the court. They can play with aggression and pump their fists. They can be strong yet beautiful. They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it all. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career. Mistakes are learning experiences, and I embrace those moments. I’m far from perfect, but I’ve also taken a lot of criticism, and I’d like to think that I went through some hard times as a professional tennis player so that the next generation could have it easier. Over the years, I hope that people come to think of me as symbolizing something bigger than tennis. I admire Billie Jean because she transcended her sport. I’d like it to be: Serena is this and she’s thatandshe was a great tennis playerandshe won those slams.Unfortunately I wasn’t ready to win Wimbledon this year. And I don’t know if I will be ready to win New York. But I’m going to try. And the lead-up tournaments will be fun. I know there’s a fan fantasy that I might have tied Margaret that day in London, then maybe beat her record in New York, and then at the trophy ceremony say, “See ya!” I get that. It’s a good fantasy. But I’m not looking for some ceremonial, final on-court moment. I’m terrible at goodbyes, the world’s worst. But please know that I am more grateful for you than I can ever express in words. You have carried me to so many wins and so many trophies. I’m going to miss that version of me, that girl who played tennis. And I’m going to miss you.HAPPY DAYSGucci Exquisite MTO gown.

Enjoy!“A champion is defined not by their wins, but by how many times they recover when they fall.”Serena WilliamsSerena Williams is a public tennis figure. She has a team of coaches, managers, and trainers. She has sponsors and a schedule.And while she has up days and down days like everyone else, it would be difficult for her to quit tennis altogether.But what about us, sitting alone in our living rooms with guitar in lap? Most likely we could stop practicing and no one would notice. No one much cares if we play our scales today or not.Guitar practice, being a solo affair, can wither on the vine without fanfare. We risk no public embarrassment. We lose no face.Learning guitar, we’re accountable only to ourselves. Our commitment is our own. Our successes and failures are largely our own (unless we choose to share them).So our relationship to ourselves affects whether we continue togrow and improveon guitar, or quit. When life gets busy, when we become sick or injured and have to take a break from practice, what then?Practice is easy when we’re excited. We coast along smoothly once we’ve built up momentum. Velocity propels us.But the real challenge begins when things get hard.One of the skills we learn as musicians is torestart after a break. It’s to get up after we fall. It’s to overcome inertia and push-start our practice from a stand-still.This is something we will do over and over. It’s rarely easy. It’s a practice in itself. And this is one of the most important and crucial techniques we learn.Once we’ve managed to touch the strings for a few days,however briefly, momentum returns. We once again feel pulled forward, instead of having to push.If we wait for the pull (inspiration, attraction, motivation), it may not come. It rarely does of its own accord.But when we pick up the guitar each day whether we feel like it or not, momentum builds. Within a few days, we begin to feel inspired andmotivated. These feelings may not stay, but at least we know how to regenerate them when they wane.Learning to play guitar is actually learning how to practice guitar. And a large part of that is simply showing up anddoing the work–day after day, without question.Hi, I’m Allen Mathews.I started as a folk guitarist, then fell in love with classical guitar in my 20’s. Despite a lot of practice and schooling, I still couldn’t get my music to flow well. I struggled with excess tension. My music sounded forced. And my hands and body were often sore. I got frustrated, and couldn’t see the way forward. Then, over the next decade, I studied with two other stellar teachers – one focused on the technical movements, and one on the musical (he was a concert pianist). In time, I came to discover a new set of formulas and movements. These brought new life and vitality to my practice. Now I help guitarists find more comfort and flow in their music, so they play more beautifully.Click herefor a sample formula.I just want to thank you for your lessons. You are helping us to understand how a piece is composed, the parts to analyze and how to do it. You are teaching a lot about how to read and play, and the most important part: PLAY with the music and ENJOY it.~ R. Martinez-R. MartinezI am a 61 year old physician, reconnecting with the classical guitar after a hiatus of nearly 40 years. After a couple of weeks [in the program], I’m now producing a much clearer, yet somehow more mellow and beautiful sound. It was really good to feel it happening in my hand, and that it felt more comfortable and somehow “right”, compared to the way I had played before (“curved picking”). The fog started to lift and I found that I was remembering more, and it felt great (also a bit of a relief!), giving me confidence to keep going. Thank you for making your course available - your love of music and the guitar shines through the teaching.

We’ve taken indisputable, recurring and conspicuous facts and buried them to create a sustainable fiction in service to nervous, cautious lies.It’s known as theTiger WoodsMedia Pandering Syndrome. It’s not enough that Woods and Serena Williams were superior in their sports, among the all-time best. To that, unfiltered nonsense had to be infused:They were the most noble to have ever played. Their unparalleled goodness may never be surpassed. They were the most extraordinarily positive influences, role models, humanitarians, offspring, spouses, parents and selfless crusaders who have touched our otherwise miserable, desperate souls.This week, coast to coast and via all form of media, Williams was crowned as more than a world championship tennis player. She is a woman of extraordinary valor and class.Doesn’t matter how much evidence to the contrary, and there’s plenty. It was wishful, ignorant, obligatory and unnecessary rubbish. Or are the Tiger Woods Impaired Driving Academy and the Serena Williams Charm School coming to a strip mall near you?Serena WilliamsAndrew Schwartz/SIPA/ShutterstocTennis may never again be “graced” by a woman who was such a relentlessly rotten winner and worse loser. She, and only she, was the reason she won or lost. If she extended credit to an opponent, it was heard as insincere, brief, parenthetical and culled.see alsoAnett Kontaveit breaks down in tears after US Open loss to Serena WilliamsWas it mere coincidence thatmany in attendanceat Williams’ second-round win, Wednesday, felt entitled to boorish, bully behavior in support of Williams, cheering opponent Anett Kontaveit’s errors including double faults?During and after the match, judging from her silence, Williams, media personification of the sportswoman, was good with that.Williams’ livid, wild-eyed tantrum at the chair ump during the 2018 Open — he’d detected she was cheating, which she denied, via signals from a coach before she shouted, among other things, “You’re a thief!” — was also cheered by the obnoxious.Williams later dubiously excused herself by explaining her behavior as an attempt to strike a blow for women’s rights.Sure enough, selectively blind and deaf media lined up to buy that “social activism” fiction. As always, she threw a fit on her own behalf only.Serena Williams berates chair umpire Carlos Ramos during the 2018 US Open.EPAThe woman whose rights were trampled that day was newcomer Naomi Osaka, left in tears for the audacity to have beaten Williams in the final, as US Open chair Katrina Adams took the court microphone to declare disappointment for all in the outcome as Williams will always be her and our champion.see alsoTicket for Serena Williams US Open match will cost you as much as $48KAdams, a black woman, later amended her claim to explain she was “thrilled” to be standing on the podium with “two women of color.” The head of the US Open held an admitted bias based on race rather than tennis.Even Williams’ last go at Wimbledon, this summer, was tethered to reports of excessive self-entitlement. Wimbledon held a Centenary Celebration marking 100 years of its Centre Court. Past champs, including injured Roger Federer, flew in.Williams blew it off. According to UK media, she was miffed that the five luxury courtesy cars she and her entourage requested and were provided, were expected to be returned the day after a player is eliminated. House rules.After losing in the first round, claimed the reports, Wimbledon refused her request to hang on to the cars for the duration of the tournament. So Williams bolted, to hell with that ceremony and Wimbledon.Weeks later in Cincinnati, ticket-buyers lured by a last live look at Williams were treated to her recurring gracious side. Crushed in the first round, she bolted, refusing a farewell to the crowd on the court microphone, then refusing to attend a post-match media session.Serena Williams yells at the line judge during the 2009 US Open.EPAAs for that vulgar, threatening 2009 episode with that Open lineswoman, she actually continued to verbally abuse her as she apparently correctly concluded that there was no way anyone would have the temerity to disqualify her for such abhorrently low conduct.Or would the No. 30 seed have been granted such an indulgence?Afterwards, she was incensed by the mere suggestion that she owed that lineswoman an apology: “An apology? From me? Well, how many people yell at linespeople?” Yeah, hers was standard tennis behavior.see alsoJohn McEnroe sets record straight on meeting Serena, Venus Williams for first timeShe later claimed she apologized.The recent movie “King Richard,”a varnished tale of the Williams sisters’ often unhinged and bigoted father and mentor — Serena was its executive producer — this year won for Will Smith the Academy Award for Best Actor. Yet it has been a colossal box office bust.Reasons given: the COVID pandemic and its streaming on HBO Max.Reasons not given are that the discerning public has grown sick of the Williams family’s act, tired of advertisers and media shoving Serena down our better senses as someone we all love and admire.This week, ESPN’s lead Open voices, Chris Fowler, John McEnroe and Chris Evert, swapped obsequious, all-glory-to-Serena sonnets — artificially sweetened fairy tales. Having witnessed much of Williams’ excessive misconduct, there is nothing better to conclude than that their commentary was transparently and intentionally dishonest.Tiger Woods Pandering Media Syndrome.

Some truths are none of your business.Old-Timers’ Days show what teams think of their fansThe combined nickel-and-dime forces of Rob Manfred, Hal Steinbrenner and Yankees president Randy Levine have combined to turn West Coast, exclusively streamed Yankee games into next-day rumors. Tuesday’s Yanks-Angels may as well have been played on the Island of Hoo-Hah.But since new Yankee Stadium opened 12 years ago, much about the Yankees — ticket pricing, 45 bucks to park, food and drink costs, conspicuously empty good seats — have created the aura of a clip joint.Consider the great show the Mets staged for Saturday’s Old-Timers’ Day, compared to this season’s on-the-cheap Yankees version.Former Mets players pose during Old-Timers’ Day.Getty Imagessee alsoAdults are ruining youth sports — phony cries of ‘racism’ at Little League World Series are only the latest offenseTheLittle League World Seriesas presented by ESPN is annually loaded with wonder beyond the necessity for a home run derby and the mindless celebrations of immodest behavior among 12-year-olds.Yet again, this year, ESPN attached a microphone to a non-English-speaking coach while providing no interpreter.Sunday, as the coach of Curacao came to the mound to try to stop the bleeding against Hawaii, he was fully heard saying something, most likely in Papiamentu — a Creole blend of African, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, French, English and Arawak Indian spoken in Curacao.How do you say, “Here, wear this microphone” in Papiamentu?Then there’s Jessica Mendoza, the still-untreated baseball blabbermouth — “A blabbermouth, Alice!” — who inspires dangerous human dashes for the mute button.Though lately starved for pitching, Aaron Boone still chooses to try to avert disasters by inviting them.Aaron BooneGetty ImagesSaturday in Oakland, Domingo German was this good: 7 ²/₃ innings, three hits allowed, no walks and striking out five on 79 pitches in a 0-0 game.Boone had seen enough!

Columbus Dispatch Scholar-Athlete: Catherine Wolfe, ReadyNewsSportsEntertainmentBusinessOpinionAdvertiseObituarieseNewspaperLegalsHIGH-SCHOOL'Service, compassion and laughter': Dispatch Scholar-Athlete Catherine Wolfe, ReadyThe Columbus DispatchHonorable mention female Scholar-AthleteCatherine WolfeReadyGrade-point average: 3.97$1,000 / Encova InsuranceMore:Class of 2021 scholar-athletes count their blessings, and lessons learnedSports played:Softball (4 years), basketball (2), volleyball (1)Academic highlights:National Honor Society member; Father Huber Memorial scholarship winner; scored 31 on ACTAthletic highlights:Captain of two-time league champion in softballCollege choice:Ohio State (anticipated major: criminology and criminal justice studies)Photo location:The science lab of my high school is one of my favorite spots because I was always doing something hands-on there. Some of my favorite labs were making marshmallow launchers and building bridges out of paper that could hold textbooks. As a curious person, it was where I knew I could go to get my questions answered. My teachers’ energy and excitement to teach matched my energy and excitement to learn.Home front:I live with my parents, Carrie and Jimmy Wolfe; my 16-year-old brother, Andrew, who is a sophomore at Ready; and my 12-year-old sister, Julia, who is in seventh grade at Our Lady of Perpetual Help.Favorite subject:Science — all of them. I took every science class I could fit into my schedule, from biology to chemistry to physics to anatomy. I love working hard to understand the “why?” in life.Least-favorite subject:Being honest, I don’t have a least-favorite. I tend to be a little bit of a nerd in that way. The subject that has given me the most trouble, however, is math. I have spent countless hours asking for calculus help. If my friends can’t find me when they get to school, the first place they look is Dr. Terri Rehner’s (the best math teacher ever!) room. They’re usually right.Prized possession:Some of the best gifts I have received are in ticket form. My favorites are from seeing “Hamilton” live, going to Washington D.C., and riding roller coasters at Cedar Point.Favorite book:“The Hunger Games,” by Suzanne Collins. I love how she uses detail and imagery, so it’s like I’m in the arena with Katniss.Favorite movie:Although “The Help” is sad at some parts, the comedic parts are fantastic. I think the overall story is eye-opening and invites conversation about important issues.Favorite television show:“The West Wing” is sophisticated, gut-wrenching and hilarious all at the same time.Favorite musicians:This is a tough question, because I love music! But if I had to narrow it down, I’d probably say Khalid or Harry Styles. They have songs for every mood and occasion.Favorite animal:Duh, the wolf. It looks friendly, but is secretly fierce (like me).Essential app:I can’t go without iMessages on my phone. I’m really bad at responding to people on any other app, so iMessages is the way I communicate with everyone.Favorite home-cooked meal:When my mom marinates pork chops and asparagus and grills them. I eat asparagus like candy.My cooking specialty:Eggs. I like to add cheese, spinach and mushrooms to them. I even have a special pan that I use to cook them.Favorite restaurant:Buffalo Wild Wings is our go-to for a postgame meal, and we always have good laughs and good food.Guilty pleasure:A venti iced coffee from Starbucks.Proudest sports moment:Winning the Central Catholic League softball championship in back-to-back years.Sport I’d like to try:Tennis. I love watching Serena Williams play, and it looks fun.Story behind my uniform number:Normally, I’m the No. 3, which I picked after I heard the “Schoolhouse Rock” song “Three is a Magic Number.” When I got to high school, No. 3 was taken, so I went to the next best, No. 13.Favorite athlete:Serena Williams is a strong, bold and competitive businesswoman. She does it all.Inspiration:My grandmothers. My mother’s mother, Chris Doppes, had a job and raised four kids while my grandfather served in the military. My father’s mother, Terri Wolfe, was a single mom who had to work hard for everything she earned. They have taught me the importance of staying true to myself, service, compassion and laughter.Dream job:President of the United States. I want to have the means to help all people. Plus, living in the White House would be pretty cool.I’d sell this in my store:I would sell shoes — all kinds of shoes! I also would add snack stations because sometimes I get a little hungry after spending too much time at the store.Place I’d like to travel:China. I have taken four years of Mandarin Chinese and the culture fascinates me.Something most people don’t know about me:I write, eat, throw and bat right-handed, but my left foot is my dominant foot when I play soccer.Least-favorite household chore:Loading the dishwasher. Having to touch food from other people’s plates is gross.True/false: I sing out loud when people are around:Always! I even tend to sing my sentences on a regular basis. A lot of times I don’t even realize it.Something I cannot get right no matter how hard I try:I can’t figure out how to do the kick worm. I shake the whole house trying, but I haven’t quite mastered it.Words to leave by:“Dream with ambition, lead with conviction.” — Kamala HarrisCareersStaff DirectoryAccessibilitySite MapLegalsOur Ethical PrinciplesSubscription Terms & ConditionsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact UsSupport Local BusinessAdvertise Your BusinessAdvertising Terms and ConditionsPromote your EventLicensing & ReprintsHelp CenterSubscriber GuideMy AccountGive FeedbackPromote Your EventSubscribe TodayNewslettersFacebookTwitterInstagrameNewspaperArchivesThisWeek News ArchivesJobsCarsHomesClassifiedsReviewed.com10BestEventsLocaliQ Digital Marketing SolutionsUSA TODAY Sports+© 2023 www.dispatch.com.

Putting those shorts on Will was like sinking into the role,” director Reinaldo Marcus Green says. “Once the shorts went on, it was game over."Set in the early 1990s,the biopic"King Richard" (in theaters and streaming onHBO MaxFriday) follows the determination of Richard and his wife Oracene (Aunjanue Ellis) to make their daughters tennis champions and tracks the fledgling careers of Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and Serena (Demi Singleton) from training on dingy courts in Compton to Venus’ 1994 professional debut at age 14.Will Smith talks suicide, abuse and Tupac Shakur:5 surprising revelations from his new memoir“I felt like I knew him immediately,” says Smith, who watched 100 hours of tape to research the role. “He's very similar to my father in some ways. I understood what it meant to feel brutalized by the world and to have a dream that nobody believes in but you, and you're not going to let that deter you. I got the heart of him.”Serena Williams, who executive produces the movie alongside sisters Venus Williams and Isha Price, says it was “an unbelievable experience” being on the set watching Smith play “such an intimate part of our lives.” She also promises “only true stories in this film, which really doesn't usually happen when it goes to Hollywood.”The Williams sisters shared many memories with the filmmakers, and here are some of the most interesting facts about “King Richard”:Holiday movie preview:10 new movies you can’t miss, from 'West Side Story' to new 'Spider-Man'Tennis wasn't Richard Williams' biggest priorityEarly on, the Williamses told filmmakers the movie needed to portray “how loving and kind their father was to them,” Smith says, and how different their perception of him was from the public’s. “He was not a father who was pushing them and hammering them to be successful at tennis. It was quite the opposite," the actor says. "He was pushing them to go to church and to get good grades and to be good people. Tennis was fourth or fifth on the list of priorities. He was using tennis to teach them how to survive in this world.”But the devoted dad wasn’t exactly a tennis aceTo accurately portray Richard’s on-court presence, Smith reached out to an instructor who knew him. “About halfway through the first lesson, the guy was like, ‘Look, Will, listen. I could teach you how to play tennis, but I think you want me to teach you to play how Richard played and Richard really didn't know how to play tennis,' ” Smith says with a chuckle. “When he worked with the girls, Richard bounces the ball and hits it and (the instructor’s) like, ‘No pro would do that. You would never teach them like that. But I gotta show you what Richard did.’ So I never actually learned the proper ways of playing tennis.”'King Richard' review:Will Smith's inspirational, imperfect tennis dad is Oscar-readyVenus and Serena Williams are really close on screen and in real lifeThe sisters are very good friends in the movie, always there for each other as the family moves from California to Florida and Venus takes her next step toward the pros. That close bond is “pretty much spot-on to what it was then and what it is now,” says Venus Williams. That closeness was important for the sisters to preserve onscreen, Green adds. “Venus said something along the lines of, ‘Serena's the kind of sister that would skip a match to see me practice.’ And that just hit home for me because I know how close I am with my own sibling. That's not something you mess with. That's real.”Richard had a signature way of disrupting meetingsOne of Venus Williams’ favorite scenes in the movie finds Richard at a contentious meeting with sports agents about her younger self's tennis future, and when he doesn’t like how it’s going, Richard loudly passes gas. The sisters told Smith this was a common occurrence back in the day. “If it didn't happen for real, you would think it was fake. You wouldn't believe that somebody would actually do that,” Smith says with a laugh. “They would be cracking up because he would do that if he wasn't hearing what he wanted to hear in the meeting.”Venus had a tennis coach, but Serena would watch tapes of her lessonsRichard enlists the help of Paul Cohen (Tony Goldwyn) but they can only afford to have him coach Venus. So Richard tapes the sessions for Serena to watch as she trains with Oracene. Serena Williams recalls that period being “definitely hard, but also at the same time, I knew I wasn't on that level yet, just to be quite frank and honest. I wasn't playing at the level that Venus was playing.” She knew she needed to work harder to be better, “but I really did not like working with my mom because she was so tough. In hindsight, she really prepared me mentally on so many things and I had to just have a lot more tenacity than I thought I could have ever had.”Serena once entered a tournament without telling her parentsVenus goes on a tear in the juniors tennis circuit, and in one sequence where Venus is playing, no one can find Serena. Then Richard and Oracene discover that she’s on a nearby court, having entered herself in a different competition. “My dad said I was too young and kept saying it. And eventually I was like, well, I'm going to just enter myself in a tournament,” Serena says. Her sister still isn't sure how she pulled it off: “Back in the day, you fill out the card, you have to send it in the mail (and) she hadn't paid the bill. (Richard’s) like, ‘Well, OK, I guess we'll pay.’ ” Serena reports she didn’t get in trouble: “I think that solidified his belief that, OK, she really does want to do it.”‘King Richard’ captures Oracene Williams’ ‘quiet’ strengthWhen Green met with the sisters’ mother, “one of the first things she said was, ‘Don't make me a chump,’ and we hadn't cast the role yet,” the director says. “Aunjunae Ellis ain't no chump.” Venus Williams was “really proud” of Ellis' performance because even though Oracene is often in the background, “she's the backbone and she's the one that really gave us our values. Of course, our dad, too, but (Ellis) really understood that quiet unshakable strength that my mom has and the authoritative part of it as well.”Richard Williams (probably) hasn’t seen the movie yetOracene Williams watched “King Richard” and although Venus Williams didn’t ask about her thoughts, “she didn't complain. We figured that was her vote of approval.” As far as their dad, Serena Williams doesn’t think he’s seen it (“At least he tells us he hasn't seen it yet”), but her sister figures he will.Smith hopes so, even after making the “mistake” of watching “Ali” as he sat right behind the man he played, Muhammad Ali. “I’ll never do that again,” he says, laughing. “But when you do this, the people you're portraying are the only audience. You're not thinking about the movie theater or the box office or awards. You can only think about, ‘Oh, my God, what if I put these people's lives on film and they hate it?’ You want the people of the film to think you did a good job.”LACMA Art+Film gala:Billie Eilish, Miley Cyrus, Serena Williams, more stars look glam in GucciFeatured Weekly AdAbout UsNewsroom StaffEthical PrinciplesRequest a CorrectionPress ReleasesAccessibilitySitemapSubscription Terms & ConditionsTerms of ServiceYour California Privacy Rights/Privacy PolicyPrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info/Cookie PolicyContact UsHelp CenterMy AccountGive FeedbackGet Home DeliveryeNewspaperUSA TODAY ShopUSA TODAY Print EditionsLicensing & ReprintsAdvertiseCareersInternshipsSupport Local BusinessNews TipsSubmitting letters to the editorPodcastsNewslettersMobile AppsFacebookTwitterInstagramLinkedInPinterestYouTubeRedditFlipboardRSS10BestReviewedJobsSports WeeklyStudio GannettUSA TODAY Sports+ClassifiedsCouponsBlueprintAuto InsurancePet InsuranceTravel InsuranceCredit CardsBankingPersonal Loans© 2023 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.

There’s definitely more to the story as Serena has her own journey to success that of course isn’t the same as from her sister’s.“King Richardhad a perfect ending with Venuson the tennis court. Venus goes in her direction, and I go in my direction,” Serena explained. “It’s two completely different stories.”However, reliving those moments of her life could prove difficult for Williams to watch.“I had a rough journey,” she said. “I didn’t do well and then I did. It’s a lot of drama. It’s a telenovela.”The film is based on the inspirational, true story ofRichard Williams(Will Smith). An undeterred father, Richard was instrumental in raising Venus (Saniyya Sidney) andSerena Williams(Demi Singleton) — two extraordinarily gifted athletes who ended up changing the sport of tennis forever. Driven by a clear vision of their future and using unconventional methods, Richard has a plan that will take Venus and Serena from the streets of Compton, California to the global stage.Pic’s producers are Tim White and Trevor White via their Star Thrower Entertainment banner, and Will Smith under his Westbrook banner.Serena andVenus Williamsexec produced the project alongside their sister Isha Price.

That close bond is “pretty much spot-on to what it was then and what it is now,” says Venus Williams. That closeness was important for the sisters to preserve onscreen, Green adds. “Venus said something along the lines of, ‘Serena's the kind of sister that would skip a match to see me practice.’ And that just hit home for me because I know how close I am with my own sibling. That's not something you mess with. That's real.”Richard had a signature way of disrupting meetingsOne of Venus Williams’ favorite scenes in the movie finds Richard at a contentious meeting with sports agents about her younger self's tennis future, and when he doesn’t like how it’s going, Richard loudly passes gas. The sisters told Smith this was a common occurrence back in the day. “If it didn't happen for real, you would think it was fake. You wouldn't believe that somebody would actually do that,” Smith says with a laugh. “They would be cracking up because he would do that if he wasn't hearing what he wanted to hear in the meeting.”Venus had a tennis coach, but Serena would watch tapes of her lessonsRichard enlists the help of Paul Cohen (Tony Goldwyn) but they can only afford to have him coach Venus. So Richard tapes the sessions for Serena to watch as she trains with Oracene. Serena Williams recalls that period being “definitely hard, but also at the same time, I knew I wasn't on that level yet, just to be quite frank and honest. I wasn't playing at the level that Venus was playing.” She knew she needed to work harder to be better, “but I really did not like working with my mom because she was so tough. In hindsight, she really prepared me mentally on so many things and I had to just have a lot more tenacity than I thought I could have ever had.”Serena once entered a tournament without telling her parentsVenus goes on a tear in the juniors tennis circuit, and in one sequence where Venus is playing, no one can find Serena. Then Richard and Oracene discover that she’s on a nearby court, having entered herself in a different competition. “My dad said I was too young and kept saying it. And eventually I was like, well, I'm going to just enter myself in a tournament,” Serena says. Her sister still isn't sure how she pulled it off: “Back in the day, you fill out the card, you have to send it in the mail (and) she hadn't paid the bill. (Richard’s) like, ‘Well, OK, I guess we'll pay.’ ” Serena reports she didn’t get in trouble: “I think that solidified his belief that, OK, she really does want to do it.”‘King Richard’ captures Oracene Williams’ ‘quiet’ strengthWhen Green met with the sisters’ mother, “one of the first things she said was, ‘Don't make me a chump,’ and we hadn't cast the role yet,” the director says. “Aunjunae Ellis ain't no chump.” Venus Williams was “really proud” of Ellis' performance because even though Oracene is often in the background, “she's the backbone and she's the one that really gave us our values. Of course, our dad, too, but (Ellis) really understood that quiet unshakable strength that my mom has and the authoritative part of it as well.”Richard Williams (probably) hasn’t seen the movie yetOracene Williams watched “King Richard” and although Venus Williams didn’t ask about her thoughts, “she didn't complain. We figured that was her vote of approval.” As far as their dad, Serena Williams doesn’t think he’s seen it (“At least he tells us he hasn't seen it yet”), but her sister figures he will.Smith hopes so, even after making the “mistake” of watching “Ali” as he sat right behind the man he played, Muhammad Ali. “I’ll never do that again,” he says, laughing. “But when you do this, the people you're portraying are the only audience. You're not thinking about the movie theater or the box office or awards. You can only think about, ‘Oh, my God, what if I put these people's lives on film and they hate it?’ You want the people of the film to think you did a good job.”LACMA Art+Film gala:Billie Eilish, Miley Cyrus, Serena Williams, more stars look glam in GucciFeatured Weekly AdAbout UsNewsroom StaffEthical PrinciplesRequest a CorrectionPress ReleasesAccessibilitySitemapSubscription Terms & ConditionsTerms of ServiceYour California Privacy Rights/Privacy PolicyPrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info/Cookie PolicyContact UsHelp CenterMy AccountGive FeedbackGet Home DeliveryeNewspaperUSA TODAY ShopUSA TODAY Print EditionsLicensing & ReprintsAdvertiseCareersInternshipsSupport Local BusinessNews TipsSubmitting letters to the editorPodcastsNewslettersMobile AppsFacebookTwitterInstagramLinkedInPinterestYouTubeRedditFlipboardRSS10BestReviewedJobsSports WeeklyStudio GannettUSA TODAY Sports+ClassifiedsCouponsBlueprintAuto InsurancePet InsuranceTravel InsuranceCredit CardsBankingPersonal Loans© 2023 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.

There’s definitely more to the story as Serena has her own journey to success that of course isn’t the same as from her sister’s.“King Richardhad a perfect ending with Venuson the tennis court. Venus goes in her direction, and I go in my direction,” Serena explained. “It’s two completely different stories.”However, reliving those moments of her life could prove difficult for Williams to watch.“I had a rough journey,” she said. “I didn’t do well and then I did. It’s a lot of drama. It’s a telenovela.”The film is based on the inspirational, true story ofRichard Williams(Will Smith). An undeterred father, Richard was instrumental in raising Venus (Saniyya Sidney) andSerena Williams(Demi Singleton) — two extraordinarily gifted athletes who ended up changing the sport of tennis forever. Driven by a clear vision of their future and using unconventional methods, Richard has a plan that will take Venus and Serena from the streets of Compton, California to the global stage.Pic’s producers are Tim White and Trevor White via their Star Thrower Entertainment banner, and Will Smith under his Westbrook banner.Serena andVenus Williamsexec produced the project alongside their sister Isha Price.

Its out to change the stigma attached to the hyper processed frozen food aisle.The female-led companyreceived $43 millionin a third round of funding led by venture capital firms and olympic athlete Shaun White, celebrity chef Bobby Flay and actress Haylie Duff this month that’s allowed it to expanded its product line to include 33 meals ready to eat instantly.Daily Harvest items seem to be nourishing the need for healthy fast food where there’s long been a gap in the frozen food space with pizza, chicken nuggets, and standalone veggies like chopped spinach.Daily Harvest delivers pre-portioned frozen superfoods to whip up overnight oats and smoothies. (Daily Harvest)“The frozen aisle is literally and figuratively a very cold place,” CEO and Founder of Daily Harvest Rachel Drori tells Moneyish. “Our investors are enthusiastic about how we’re leveraging the long-overlooked and misrepresented frozen food market to make nutritious, plant-based food convenient and accessible nationwide.”SEE ALSO: Gwyneth Paltrow and Serena Williams are freezing their assetsThe female-led company started out with just smoothies in 2015, and has since expanded new savory grain bowls made with cauliflower and rice (a lighter riff on Italian risotto), and a zesty quinoa chipotle burrito bowl out in January. Its acquired more than 100,000 subscribers nationwide.Drori, 35, thought up the idea for the business based on her own dilemma of wanting to eat healthy, but having no time to meal prep when she was working in sales and marketing for Gilt Groupe. She would freeze fruits and veggies herself and make smoothies to eat on the go. The life hack eventually turned into a business plan that prompted her to quit her job and rent out a commercial kitchen in Long Island City, Queens where she started delivering her fruit-filled smoothie cups to friends and family. Since then, she enlisted Michelin-trained chef Jessica Young and a nutritionist to help think up creative and tasty recipes, and hired a team for more than 30 ladies to help run the brand which ships nationwide.“I had to pull all nighters,” says Drori of beefing up business. “The biggest challenge was taking time away from a rapidly scaling business. There just were not enough hours in the day.”Frozen food is heating up the market estimated to reach$360.36 billion by 2024.And according to the Mintel Global Food and Drink Trends 2017 report, there was a 257 percent increase in the number of vegan food and beverage launches in 2016, compared to five years ago, and many brands have attempted to break into the healthy frozen food space. Organic brands like Annie’s Homegrown has a line of pizza bites with no artificial ingredients, and made mac ‘n’ cheese healthyish before being bought by General Mills. Kashi boasts a fiber-rich line of frozen waffles; and plant-based brand Amy’s has meals you can defrost for breakfast, lunch and dinner from apple toaster pops to a black bean burritos and vegetable lasagna, but none deliver.Daily Harvest superfoodies can opt to order six to 24 cups weekly at $7.99 each, or monthly (approximately 24 cups) for $6.99. You can choose a combination any snack or meal, like the immunity-boosting tomato minestrone packed with veggies like zucchini, tomatoes and chickpeas; a cacao and avocado pudding said to taste like chocolate and loaded with pea protein; or sundaes like chocolate brownie batter made with cocoa, black beans, hemp protein and coconut. Each require minimal prepping effort -- just add water and heat soups, smoothies need a liquid base like milk added before being tossed into a blender; and grain bowls can simply be microwaved or sautéed on the stove.“Each is meant to be a nutritional powerhouse that’s a balance of fiber, healthy fats and all the things you really need to sustain yourself so you don’t get a sugar high and crash,” says Drori.Daily Harvest delivers pre-portioned frozen superfoods to whip up overnight oats and smoothies. (Daily Harvest)The frozen fast food has attracted a handful of celebrity investors. Tennis ace Williams, who expressed interest in the brand earlier this year, personally called Drori.“With Serena I got an email from her now husband [Alexis Ohanian] who simply said ‘I absolutely love your product.’ He said ‘My girlfriend is also obsessed. I’d love for you to talk to her,’” Drori recalls. “I got on the phone with Serena Williams and she wanted to invest.”Nutritionists say eating frozen fruits and veggies is actually better for you. New research from the University of Georgia found that frozen fruits and vegetables are just as nutritious as their fresh counterparts with some even retaining more nutrients, particularly when it comes to vitamin A.“I totally advocate for freezing fruits and vegetables. What happens is they’re picked at the height of ripeness and flash frozen so they preserve the nutrients better as opposed to sitting in trucks or on the supermarket shelf,” says registered dietitian and nutritionist Lisa Young.Drori predicts the hot new superfood of the new year will be the unassuming ingredient pine pollen, a nutritive adaptogen tonic powder collected from pine trees and consumed as a dietary supplement. It’s said to help the body cope with stress.“You can put it in anything. It has barely any taste and it’s just really wonderful,” she says.AdvertisementAdvertisementPartner CenterAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementMost PopularAdvertisement‘Cry me a river, right?’: I sold our rental for $325,000.

Scholar Athlete: Anna SchildmeyerNewsSportsEntertainmentBusinessOpinionAdvertiseObituarieseNewspaperLegalsSPORTSScholar Athlete: Anna SchildmeyerStaff WriterThe Columbus DispatchWho: First runner-up female Scholar-Athlete Anna SchildmeyerSchool: Upper ArlingtonGrade-point average: 4.27Scholarship: $6,000 // Wolfe AssociatesSports played:Lacrosse (4 years), field hockey (4)Academic highlights:National Merit Commended Scholar; AP Scholar Award winner; National Honor Society member; scored 34 on ACTAthletic highlights:All-league in lacrosse; four-year starter on state champion lacrosse teamCollege choice:Georgetown University (anticipated major: global health or human biology, with pre-med track)Photo location:In the Galaxy Lounge on the sixth floor at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, where I have volunteered for the past four yearsHome front:My parents are Karri and Jerry Schildmeyer. I have a twin sister, Olivia, who is attending Virginia next year, and a younger sister, Ellena, who is a freshman in high school.Favorite subject:Science, specifically biology. It’s fascinating to understand how the world works and the intricate levels and interactions within biology that make us unique. I also like the hands-on nature of science classes and participating in labs.Least-favorite subject:History classes give me the most trouble because you either know the answer or you don’t — you can’t work the problem out and come to an answer through abstract thinking. I still enjoy learning about history, but it’s definitely time-consuming and requires significant memorization.How I relax:When it’s nice outside I like taking long bike rides that culminate in an ice cream stop, or sitting in our screened-in porch while listening to music.Favorite book:“The Count of Monte Cristo,” by Alexandre Dumas. We read it in seventh grade and I loved how the intertwined adventures tied together in the plotting of a great revenge. I enjoyed every second while reading it.Favorite movie:“The Parent Trap” will always be my all-time favorite. My twin sister and I grew up watching that movie and loving that it revolved around twins. We rented it from the library every week and somehow it never got old.Favorite TV show:I’m not a big TV watcher but when I do I like ABC’s TGIT with “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Scandal,” and “The Catch.” My sisters and I watch it together every week so it’s fun bonding.Favorite musical group:I grew up listening to Coldplay around the house and “Viva La Vida” was my morning alarm for years of elementary and middle school. Each of their albums has a different style and it’s nice to choose an album based on my mood. I went to their concert last summer and am excited to go again this year!Favorite website:I have random thoughts throughout the day and it’s nice to quickly search them on Google. I like that I can learn a variety of new things each day. Google is a great link to everything else the Internet has to offer.Essential app:Spotify. I’m constantly listening to music, whether I’m driving to practice, sitting in study hall, doing homework or relaxing. Spotify is great because you can follow your friends and share/collaborate on playlists so I’m always finding new music I like.Favorite home-cooked meal:My parents usually cook together and they make a simple meal of grilled chicken, homemade French fries and fresh fruits and vegetables. It always tastes good and is a favorite during the summer when we eat outside on our porch. A close second is definitely breakfast for dinner — few things beat chocolate-chip pancakes and bacon after a long day of school.My cooking specialty:I’m not a great chef, but I love making chocolate-chip scones. My sisters and I eat an entire batch in a matter of hours. I’m a huge fan of brunch and breakfast pastries so scones are a definite favorite.Favorite restaurant:Third & Hollywood, in Grandview. I’m a pretty picky eater and they have the best grilled cheese sandwich and fries, which I order nearly every time. This is also my favorite meal when we go out — my family always jokes that my wedding will have a grilled cheese bar.Guilty pleasure:There’s a bakery in Cincinnati that makes the most delicious double dark chocolate cake. My favorite food is dark chocolate and we only have this cake on my dad’s birthday each year so I savor every bite.Proudest sports moment:My lacrosse team winning the Division I state championship in 2015 and ’16 was an incredible experience. It was so fun to win with my teammates who are also some of my best friends. The 2016 season was special because both our boys and girls lacrosse teams won states, so it was exciting to share that!Sport I’d like to try someday:I grew up skiing and snowboarding and would love to try freestyle skiing or ski jumping. Skiing is exhilarating and always pushes me to challenge myself so it would be fun, and slightly terrifying, to try the more extreme side of the sport.Favorite athlete:Serena Williams. I’ve always loved watching tennis and she’s such a phenomenal athlete and role model for young female athletes.Inspiration:My twin sister, Olivia, inspires me every day. She’s good at everything she tries and consistently works hard at school, sports and making time for friends. She has a perfect balance in her life that I strive for and she is always improving. Her success inspires me to be my best self.Person I’d like to meet:I never met my grandfather on my dad’s side and I’ve always wanted to. People tell me I’m a spitting image of my dad in physical resemblance and personality and I wonder if that rings true with my grandfather, as well.Place I’d like to travel:Europe, especially Ireland. Part of my family is from Ireland and it would be so fun to experience the culture and go sightseeing to places like the Cliffs of Moher.Dream job:A doctor. I want an active career where I can interact with and help people each day and medicine fits perfectly. The innovative nature of the medical field is an incredible place to be and I’m hoping I’ll be there in the near future.Something most people don’t know about me:I can sing — and it won’t hurt your ears! I usually only sing around the house or in the car but my goal is to sing in front of a crowd at some point. We’ll have to wait and see when that happens.Least-favorite household chore:Probably making my bed. I give myself limited time to get ready for school each day and I rarely allocate time for making my bed. I usually climb back in bed to relax after school anyway so it’s hard to convince myself that it’s worth it.Something I cannot get right no matter how hard I try:Being on time — I’m a bit of a procrastinator.Words to leave by:“To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other, and to feel. That is the purpose of life.” — James Thurber, from “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.”CareersStaff DirectoryAccessibilitySite MapLegalsOur Ethical PrinciplesSubscription Terms & ConditionsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact UsSupport Local BusinessAdvertise Your BusinessAdvertising Terms and ConditionsPromote your EventLicensing & ReprintsHelp CenterSubscriber GuideMy AccountGive FeedbackPromote Your EventSubscribe TodayNewslettersFacebookTwitterInstagrameNewspaperArchivesThisWeek News ArchivesJobsCarsHomesClassifiedsReviewed.com10BestEventsLocaliQ Digital Marketing SolutionsUSA TODAY Sports+© 2023 www.dispatch.com.

Preheat the oven to 425 F. In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, brown sugar, paprika, dried oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix to combine.2. Prep and cut your vegetables, and place them in a large mixing bowl. Add the olive oil spice mixture, and stir to mix well. If the vegetables seem a little dry, add more olive oil a tablespoon at a time until they are well coated.3. Once coated, place the vegetables on a large rimmed baking sheet or 2 baking sheets if they are too crowded on one.4. Roast for 10 minutes at 425 F, stir everything with a rubber spatula, and continue to roast for another 6-8 minutes until the veggies can be easily pierced through with a fork and have started to caramelize in spots. Taste and add additional salt as needed, then set aside to cool.5. To make the vegan green goddess dressing, add the avocado, cilantro, pistachios, jalapeno, salt, pepper, lime zest, lime juice, and water into a food processor. Pulse until everything is mostly broken up and mixed together for about 30 seconds. Then, drizzle in the olive oil and blend until smooth. The sauce should be the consistency of a creamy salad dressing. If it’s too thick, add more olive oil a tablespoon at a time until it reaches the right consistency. Taste, adjust seasoning as needed, and serve in a bowl beside the roasted veggies, tortillas of choice, and lime wedges.Other Recipes You Might LikeNo Mess Beer BratPairs with Michelob ULTRAPeanut Noodle Salad JarPairs with Michelob UltraMatch Point Ceviche and Plantain ChipsPairs with Kiwi Lime SeltzerSpaghetti Squash ScampiPairs with Blueberry Watermelon SeltzerAnheuser-BuschAbout Anheuser-BuschCareersSocial ResponsibilityPressSupportFAQContact UsConsumer InformationAccessibility StatementSTAY CONNECTEDJoin NewsletterAlways enjoy responsibly.

WILLIAMS: That's my little sister, guys.(LAUGHTER)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: Ladies and gentlemen, our champion, the legendary Serena Williams.(APPLAUSE)S. WILLIAMS: She's the only reason I'm standing here today and the only reason that the Williams sisters exist. So thank you, Venus, for inspiring me.(APPLAUSE)GARCIA-NAVARRO: Serena Williams beat her big sister, Venus, on Saturday to win the Australian Open. It's her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, a new record. In this week's edition of Out Of Bounds, our ongoing conversation about sports and culture, we talk with Clinton Yates. He's a writer for the ESPN website The Undefeated and penned an intensely personal essay about how he came to admit that Serena is his favorite athlete of all time.Thanks for coming here.CLINTON YATES: Anytime.GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to talk about this article which caught our eye. You wrote that it took you years to be able to say this out loud. Say it. What is it?YATES: Serena Williams is my favorite athlete of all time.GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK (laughter), tell us, why was it so hard for you, as a man, to admire a woman athlete?YATES: I think there's two reasons. No. 1, is that as somebody that grew up - you know, I played three sports in high school. I played soccer. I played basketball. I played baseball. So my entire, sort of, psychological link to what I cared about in sports was very much toward, No. 1, those sports and No. 2, people who I saw who I felt were better at team games.But I also think that too many athletes are so caught up, from an identity standpoint, in one thing or another thing - whether it's being a woman, whether it's being black or whether it's being someone who's not American. In this case, Serena obviously is American. But you know how sometimes there's something that you like and you keep returning to it and you don't really have a reason why? And then something happens and you're like - wow, I know a lot more about that than I cared to realize.And it was when she last won Wimbledon, and I just looked at myself, and I said - I don't know that there's another person I'd rather watch play sports. And that's all I do for a living, you know what I mean? And...GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was the moment for you?YATES: That was the moment for me. It was the last Wimbledon where I said - wow, not only is she my favorite athlete from a standpoint of playing the game, but I am here for the fashion. I am here for what she does off the court. I am here for her eloquence and intelligence and personal standards. The situation that happened at Indian Wells - she didn't play there for years because she felt it was a racist location, and she was not going to deal with that.GARCIA-NAVARRO: I want to come back to this idea of you - obviously - as a man, making this admission about a woman athlete. What has been the reaction when you talked about this on Twitter, when you've talked about this publicly? What has been the reaction among other men?YATES: The first reaction I got to that was some guy said, I'm having a hard time imagining you wearing a tennis skirt, which instantly indicated to me where most people are at, from a guy's standpoint, when it comes to what they think about women. They are ultimately just objects of desire or of their gaze. So a lot of guys, for me, reacted - oh, come on, how could you say something like that? And it's like well, you know, sorry, dude - I don't look at all women as sex objects, No. 1. And No. 2, I don't view all things that women do in athletic context as lesser than.And that - those two things right there are more than most men are not only willing to do but need to do. That's the problem. You know, this is what toxic masculinity and patriarchy bring to you in society - is that if you don't have to do that, you will not do that. And so once I, you know, made that personal growth point, which was 10, 15 odd years ago, you know, it's not hard for me to say that.GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what did you think of the match?YATES: The grace that they showed toward each other, the actual competitiveness that they show on the court, it's really, really something to see. And if you haven't gotten a chance to watch it, it's worth watching the fullness of the match from entrance to exit, not just the part where they're hitting the tennis balls because their relationship is so special like that.GARCIA-NAVARRO: Clinton Yates is a writer for The Undefeated. Thanks.YATES: Pas de quoi.Copyright © 2017 NPR.  All rights reserved.

She now returns to the No. 1 spot after losing that ranking in September to Angelique Kerber.Despite an intense game in the Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne, the two sisters were all smiles and compliments in the post-match ceremony."There's no way I could be at 23 without her," Serena, 35, said of her sister. "Thank you Venus for inspiring me to be the best player I can be."The Two-WayNadal Books Date With Federer For Australian Open Title"Serena Williams. That's my little sister, guys," Venus said. "Your win has always been my win."The last time the two sisters faced off for the Australian Open was in 2003, which resulted in a win for Serena. She now has a 17-11 career record against Venus, which includes a record of 10-5 of Grand Slams, The Associated Press reports.With a combined age of 71, the sisters made up the oldest women's Grand Slam final. At 36, Venus was the oldest Grand Slam finalist in 23 years."I really elevated my game somehow," Serena told ESPN afterward, saying she still thinks she's in the prime of her career. "I really wanted to get to 23 so bad, more than you can imagine" she added.The Australian Open continues Sunday, when Roger Federer is scheduled to face off against Rafael Nadal in the men's final.FacebookTwitterFlipboardEmailRead & ListenHomeNewsCultureMusicPodcasts & ShowsConnectNewslettersFacebookTwitterInstagramPressContact & HelpAbout NPROverviewDiversityAccessibilityEthicsFinancesPublic EditorCorrectionsGet InvolvedSupport Public RadioSponsor NPRNPR CareersNPR ShopNPR EventsNPR ExtraTerms of UsePrivacyYour Privacy ChoicesText OnlySponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Overall, a fifth of tennis fans name Serena Williams (21%) as one of their favourite athletes, meaning she is almost twice as popular as the next female athlete on the list – Naomi Osaka (12%).The fact that Williams retains such a high position on the ladder in spite of her appearances on court becoming increasingly sporadic in recent years is a testament to her enduring legacy.Among her compatriots, Serena Williams isthefavorite tennis athlete, with two in five American tennis fans (38%) indicating the same, leaving behind Roger Federer (30%), Rafael Nadal (30%) and Novak Djokovic (24%) by some margin.Not just in the US, but Williams enjoys outsized popularity in a variety of nations in the Americas. Two-fifths of Colombian (41%) and Mexican (40%) tennis fans say she is their favourite tennis athlete, as do three in ten Brazilians (31%) and a quarter of Canadians (26%).In most markets across the globe, she is the top female tennis player. The notable exceptions to this trend being China, Japan, Germany, and Australia, where homegrown stars like Zhang Shuai, Naomi Osaka, Angelique Kerber, and Ash Barty supersede Williams in popularity.Off the field, the 23-time champion has been an icon for inclusivity and feminism. Have her efforts made an impact on society? Looking at YouGov Profiles data from the US, we find that Serena Williams fans are significantly likelier than all sports fans todisagreewith the statement “watching women’s sport is not as exciting as watching men’s”. Nearly half of Serena Williams fans (45%) disagree with that statement compared to just 29% of all sports fans. Williams fans are much more likely to find the excitement in women’s sport.Serena Williams fans are also 14 percentage points likelier to feel that “men and women are still not treated equally in the workplace” (84% vs 70% of all sports fans) and are nine points likelier to opine that “sports need to be more inclusive” (68% vs 57%).Williams leaves the court having made an indelible mark on the history of tennis and on the sporting landscape in general – but with still more work to be done by the authorities on equality according to her fans.Discover moresports contenthereWant to run your own research?Start building a survey nowExplore ourliving data– for free.Make smarter business decisions with better intelligence.

After debuting back in 1995, the American athlete has conquered all before her and remains one of the most important players on the court.Williams is up there withRoger Federer, Rafael Nadal, andNovak Djokovicwith her dominance. A sports person this great also happens to have fine taste in cars. Serena William's car collection has a wide variety of cars ranging from SUVs to luxury saloons, tosports cars.She seems to have a soft spot for British cars as her collection contains not one, but three Brits - that includes a Bentley, an Aston Martin, and even a Mini. And now, withSerena Williams announcing her retirement from tennis, she has a lot of time to enjoy her sweet rides; and even add some new cars to the collection.Updated August 2022: Since Serena Williams is retiring from tennis, she is going to get more time to spend with her beloved cars. We have updated this article with the latest information about her vibrant car collection.With such a haul of trophies to her name, let's take a look at the other bright and shiny things in her life; Serena Williams' car collection.RELATED:Roger Federer's Car Collection Is A Total AceSerena Owns A Lincoln NavigatorWilliams became a brand ambassador for the Lincoln Navigator in 2018, which has seen the tennis star behind the wheel of the luxury SUV. Aligning herself with the Navigator was actually a blast from the past for Williams, whose very first car was also the famous car.Williams loved that car and gave it the nickname 'Ginger' before passing it over to her niece as a gift after eight years behind the wheel. The Grand Slam superstar is now back in control of her beloved SUV, albeit a more modern version.Sports stars are the envy of their fans as not only do they get to play the sport they love for a living, but they also get amazing sponsorship deals like this. Brands will clamor to get the best athletes' faces next to their products, and it's a win-win for these superstars.Serena Loves Her MiniElite athletes spend a lot of their time in the spotlight. They can hold the gaze of thousands of fans at an arena and millions more who are watching at home. There is a lot of pressure on a professional sports star to live exemplary lives, but it's worth remembering that they are people too.Williams' 2016Mini Countrymanwas made famous in 2017 after she was pulled over by the police for a speeding infringement. Getting caught speeding isn't that uncommon, as sometimes we're running a little late, and we need to put the pedal to the metal. Unlike your average Joe, when Williams was caught speeding, it became national news.Serena Adorns Her Aston Martin VanquishAs we mentioned already, being a world-famous sports star has its benefits. Before Williams was a brand ambassador for Lincoln, she was the face of Aston Martin. Being the face of such a famous luxury sports car brand came with the perks most gearheads can only dream about, getting an Aston Martin for free.Williams gained control ofthe 5.9-liter V12 Vanquishuntil she switched allegiance to Lincoln in 2018. The Vanquish is a perfect blend of power and style, something that compliments the way Williams approaches her tennis career.Williams is known for her powerful approach to playing tennis, but while she's on the court, she also considers style to be an important aspect. Besides being one of the all-time greats, Williams is also known as one of the most stylish tennis players on the circuit.RELATED:10 Cool Facts Everyone Forgot About Aston Martin's Sports CarsSerena Williams Has A Bentley Continental GTAlexander Migl Via Wikimedia CommonsIt would seem that Williams looks for luxury above most other characteristics when getting behind the wheel of a new car. The multiple Grand Slam winner is one of the highest-earning stars on tour, and she puts those winnings to good use with her car collection.With Williams conquering Wimbledon five times, it seems she has a lot of fun in Britain. Perhaps that affinity for British soil has endeared theBentley Continental GTto Williams. The Continental GT comes with a 4.0-liter V8 engine and maxes out at 198 mph. Power and elegance are once again the standout characteristics of a Serena Williams car, this time, it's the one and only Bentley Continental GT.Serena Williams Rolls In A Mercedes-Benz G-WagonWagon Master 2.0 Via Wikimedia CommonsSerena Williams proved she wouldn't be eating other celebrities' dust when keeping up with the latest car trends. The tennis superstar, like so many other wealthy and powerful people, gets behind the wheel ofa Mercedes G-Wagon. Otherwise, known as the G-Class, this legendary SUV has been around since the 1970s in different guises until the current crop appeared in 1992.Although not always desirable, the G-Wagon has become popular thanks to stars like Williams, Kevin Hart, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Kylie Jenner. Equipped with a 4.0-liter V8, the G-Class can handle just about anything you wish to throw at it.The SUV will get you from A to B in a hurry on the roads or make light work of any type of rough terrain you like. No matter the situation, the G-Wagon remains pure luxury on the inside. It means that even if her G-Class is caked in mud from a trip off-road, Williams can step onto the red carpet without missing a beat.Sources: Washingtonpost, Serena Williams Via InstagramShareTweetShareShareCopyEmailShareShareTweetShareShareCopyEmailLink copied to clipboardRelated TopicsFamous CollectionsCar CultureSports CarsAbout The AuthorConnor Doyle(86 Articles Published)Connor is a content writer and journalist from the UK with several years in the business.

She rode with NASCAR driver Kurt Busch, and afterward she seemed moved by the experience.What moved her the most?“The fact that they’re driving 200 mph behind each other and there’s like two inches that separate them,” she said. “And then if, they just, you know — it’s crazy.”Part of that insanity was Williams’ discovery that NASCAR steering wheels can be (easily) removed. Reassured that the racecars have lots of protective features, she took a skeptical tone.“I guess it’s the safest car on the road,” she said, with a hint of sarcasm. “That’s one way of looking at it.”Williams and her sister, Venus, became tennis stars before they were even old enough to drive legally, so Serena’s car was not a typical teen’s first car. Her first ride? A BMW Z3.“It’s a two-seater,” she said. “I still have it. I drive it fast.”How fast?“Not as fast as young Kurt [Busch],” she laughed.She allows that she has occasionally gone faster than authorities would like. “I’ve gotten a few speeding tickets in the past, but I try not to drive as fast any more.” This experience may reinforce that resolve.So, besides the Z3, what else is sitting in her garage?“I have a truck, a Cadillac truck,” Serena said. “I have a Range Rover Sport.“I’m an SUV kind of girl.”Fast Cars & Superstars Coverage on Cars.comOther Fast Cars & Superstars ProfilesGabrielle ReeceKasey KahneKurt BuschBill CowherJohn CenaTony HawkJohn ElwayLatest newsTesla’s Price-Cutting Streak Continues, New Base Model Y AddedApril 10, 2023How to Fix Rust on a CarApril  9, 2023What’s the Best New-Car Deal for April 2023?April  7, 2023See all latest newsLearn moreShop cars for sale near youResearch carsCompare vehiclesFeatured storiesNewsIs Now a Good Time to Buy a Used Car?By Jane UlitskayaMarch 31, 2023NewsWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying GuideBy Cars.com EditorsMarch 28, 2023Expert Review2023 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid Review: Good on Gas, Bad on NoiseBy Jennifer GeigerNews EditorLatest expert reviewsExpert Review2023 Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid Review: Less Slow, Still SteadyBy Brian NormileRoad Test EditorExpert Review2023 Toyota Prius Prime Review: Sportier for Sure, But Why?By Brian NormileRoad Test EditorExpert Review2024 Mazda CX-90 Review: More Than MainstreamBy Mike HanleySenior EditorBuying & SellingFind a CarFind a DealerListings by CityCertified Pre-OwnedCar Payment CalculatorsCar Reviews & RatingsCompare Side by SideFraud AwarenessSell Your CarExplore Our BrandNewCars.comDealerRaterFor DealersDealer LoginGrowWithCars.comFUELDealer InspireDealerRaterAccu-TradeOur CompanyAbout Cars.comContact Cars.comInvestor RelationsCareersLicensing & ReprintsSite MapFeedbackOur Mobile AppDownload the App TodayConnect With UsTerms & Conditions of UsePrivacy NoticeCalifornia Privacy NoticeDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAccessibility StatementAd Choices©
