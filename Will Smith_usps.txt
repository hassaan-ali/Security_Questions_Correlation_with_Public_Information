Please show the world that you're as smart as we think you are". Smith said that this influenced his decision not to use profanity in his music.[25]CareerFurther information:Will Smith filmography,Will Smith discography, andList of awards and nominations received by Will Smith1985–1992: DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh PrinceSmith at the Emmy Awards 1993Smith started as theMCof the hip-hop duoDJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, with his childhood friendJeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townesasturntablistand producer.[26]Townes and Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smith's residence, and he was missing hishype man.

At least, that's been the excuse, although judging by the finished product, it was the script that never lived up to the promise of its premise."[97]Later that year, Smith had his second starring role in an animated film, inSpies in Disguise, oppositeTom Holland.

Smith subsequently resigned fromthe Academyand was banned from attending all Academy functions, including the Oscars, for ten years.[14]Early lifeSmith was born and raised inPhiladelphiaas Willard Carroll Smith II on September 25, 1968,  to Caroline (née Bright), a school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith Sr.,[15][16]a US Air Force veteran[17]and refrigeration engineer. His mother graduated fromCarnegie Mellon University.[18]Smith grew up in West Philadelphia'sWynnefieldneighborhood[19]and was raisedBaptist.[20]He has an elder sister named Pamela and two younger siblings, twins Harry and Ellen.[19]He attended Our Lady of Lourdes, a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia,[21]andOverbrook High School.[22]His parents separated when he was 13[23]and divorced around the year 2000.[24]Smith began rapping at age 12. When his grandmother found a notebook of his lyrics, which he described as containing "all [his] little curse words", she wrote him a note on a page in the book: "Dear Willard, truly intelligent people do not have to use words like this to express themselves. Please show the world that you're as smart as we think you are". Smith said that this influenced his decision not to use profanity in his music.[25]CareerFurther information:Will Smith filmography,Will Smith discography, andList of awards and nominations received by Will Smith1985–1992: DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh PrinceSmith at the Emmy Awards 1993Smith started as theMCof the hip-hop duoDJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, with his childhood friendJeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townesasturntablistand producer.[26]Townes and Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smith's residence, and he was missing hishype man. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype man finally made it to the party.[27]Soon after, the two decided to join forces. Smith enlisted a friend to join as the beatboxer of the group, Clarence Holmes akaReady Rock C, making them a trio. Philadelphia-based Word Records released their first single in 1986 whenA&RmanPaul Oakenfold[28]introduced them to Champion Records with their single "Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble," a tale of funny misadventures that landed Smith and his former DJ and rap partner Mark Forrest (Lord Supreme) in trouble.[29]The song sampled the theme song of "I Dream of Jeannie." Smith became known for light-hearted story-telling raps and capable, though profanity-free, "battle" rhymes. The single became a hit a month before Smith graduated from high school.[30]Based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention ofJive RecordsandRussell Simmons. The duo's first album,Rock the House, which was first released on Word Up in 1986 debuted on Jive in March 1987. The group received the firstGrammy Award for Best Rap Performancein 1989 for "Parents Just Don't Understand" (1988), though their most successful single was "Summertime" (1991), which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on theBillboardHot 100. Smith and Townes are still friends and claim that they never split up, having made songs under Smith's solo performer credit.[31]Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes.[26]TheInternal Revenue Serviceeventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, andgarnishedhis income.[32]Smith was struggling financially in 1990 when theNBCtelevision network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him.[26]The show was successful and began his acting career.

The latter film was commercially successful, grossing $141.4 million worldwide.[34]However, critical reception was generally mixed.[35]In 1996, Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast inRoland Emmerich'sIndependence Day. The film was a massive blockbuster, becoming the second highest-grossing film in history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw.[36]In the summer of 1997, he starred alongsideTommy Lee Jonesin the hitMen in Black, playingAgent J. The film was released on July 2 byColumbia Picturesand grossed over $589.3 million worldwide against a $90 million budget, becoming the year's third highest-grossing film, with an estimated 54,616,700 tickets sold in the US.[37]It received positive reviews, with critics praising its humor, as well as Jones's and Smith's performances.During the summer of 1997, Smith also began his solo music career with the release of "Men in Black", the theme song for the film, which topped singles charts in several regions across the world, including the UK.[38]"Men in Black" (and second single "Just Cruisin'") was later included on Smith's debut solo albumBig Willie Style, which reached the top ten of the USBillboard200and was certified nine times platinum by theRecording Industry Association of America(RIAA).[39][40]The third single from the album, "Gettin' Jiggy wit It", became Smith's firstBillboardHot 100number one when it was released in 1998.[41]1998–2007: Leading man statusSmith in 1999In 1998, Smith starred withGene HackmaninEnemy of the State.[26]The following year he turned down the role ofNeoinThe Matrixin favor ofWild Wild West(1999). Despite the disappointment ofWild Wild West, Smith said that he has no regrets about his decision, asserting thatKeanu Reeves's performance as Neo was superior to what Smith himself would have achieved,[42]although in interviews subsequent to the release ofWild Wild Westhe said that he "made a mistake onWild Wild West. That could have been better."[43]Smith's second album was again supported by the release of a film theme song as the lead single: "Wild Wild West", featuringDru HillandKool Moe Dee, topped theBillboardHot 100 and was certified gold by the RIAA.[40][41]The album in question,Willennium, reached number five on theBillboard200 and was certified double platinum by the RIAA.[39][40]"Will 2K", the second single from the album, reached number 25 on theBillboardHot 100.[41]Before the end of 1999, a video album was released featuring Smith's seven music videos released to date,[44]which reached number 25 on theUK Music Video Chart.[45]The same year, he was also featured onThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Airco-starTatyana Ali's single "Boy You Knock Me Out", which reached number three on theUK Singles Chartand topped theUK R&B Singles Chart.[38][46]Smith portrayed heavyweight boxerMuhammad Aliin the 2001 biopicAli.

In the film Smith portraysChris Gardner. Smith first became interested in making a film about Gardner after seeing him on20/20and connected with him during production. The film, along with Smith's performance, received praise.[51][52]Smith hosting the 2011 Walmart Shareholders MeetingOn December 10, 2007, Smith was honored atGrauman's Chinese TheatreonHollywood Boulevard. Smith left an imprint of his hands and feet outside the theater in front of many fans.[53]Later that month, Smith starred in the filmI Am Legend, released on December 14, 2007. Alongside marginally positive reviews,[54]its opening was the largest ever for a film released in the United States during December. Smith himself has said that he considers the film to be "aggressively unique".[55]A reviewer said that the film's commercial success "cemented [Smith's] standing as the number one box office draw in Hollywood."[56]On December 1, 2008,TV Guidereported that Smith was selected as one of America's top ten most fascinating people of 2008 for aBarbara WaltersABCspecial that aired on December 4, 2008.[57]2008–2019: Blockbusters and critical disappointmentsIn 2008, Smith was reported to be developing a film entitledThe Last Pharaoh, in which he would be starring asTaharqa.[58]Smith later starred in the superhero movieHancock,[59]which grossed $227,946,274 in the United States and Canada and had a worldwide total of $624,386,746.[60]On August 19, 2011, it was announced that Smith returned to the studio with producer La Mar Edwards to work on his fifth studio album.[61]Smith again reprised his role as Agent J withMen in Black 3, which opened on May 25, 2012, his first major starring role in four years.[62][63]After the release of the film, Smith was content with ending his work with the franchise, saying, "I think three is enough for me. Three of anything is enough for me. We'll look at it and we'll consider it, but it feels like that it might be time to let someone else do that."[64]Men in Black 3, released ten years afterMen in Black II(2002), grossed over $624 million worldwide.[65][66]Unadjusted for inflation, it is the highest-grossing film in the series.[67][68]In 2013, Smith starred inAfter Earthwith his son Jaden. The film was a disappointment at the domestic box office and was panned critically.[69]Calling the film "the most painful failure in my career", Smith ended up taking a year and a half break as a result.[70]Smith andSuicide Squadco-starMargot Robbiein 2016Smith starred oppositeMargot Robbiein the romance dramaFocus, released on February 27, 2015.[71]He played Nicky Spurgeon, a veteran con artist who takes a young, attractive woman under his wing. Smith was set to star in the sci-fi thrillerBrilliance, an adaptation ofMarcus Sakey's novel of the same name scripted byJurassic ParkwriterDavid Koepp, but he left the project to work on theRidley Scott-produced sports dramaConcussion.[72][73]InConcussion, Smith played Dr.Bennet Omaluof theBrain Injury Research Institute, the first to discoverchronic traumatic encephalopathy. Smith reported he had doubts about the film early in the production, saying, "some of my happiest memories are of watching my son catch and throw a football. I didn't want to be the guy who did a movie saying football could be dangerous." These views subsided when he met Omalu, whose words about American ideals resonated with Smith.[74]Smith's performance was praised for being "sensitive [and] understated".[75]In 2016, Smith playedDeadshotin the supervillain team-up action filmSuicide Squad.[76]Smith's participation in the film meant choosing it over a role inIndependence Day: Resurgence, which he said would be like "clinging and clawing backwards."[77]WhileSuicide Squadwas a massive financial success, earning over $700 million at the box office, the film received negative reviews from critics.

He is one of few people who have enjoyed legitimate success in the three major entertainment media in the United States: film, television, and the music industry.Will Smith was born and raised in West Philadelphia. He spent most of his days in a playground, training basketball and relaxing all cool. Career-wise, he started as the vocalist of the hip-hop duoDJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, with his childhood friend Jeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townes as turntablist and producer. The duo was known for performing humorous, radio-friendly songs, most notably "Parents Just Don't Understand" and "Summertime." They gained critical acclaim for winning the first ever Grammy in the Rap category (1988).Smith was a charismatic and energetic performer but he was nearing bankruptcy when in 1990, the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him. The show was successful and helped revitalize his careerAlthough he made a notable dramatic film debut in Six Degrees of Separation (in which he played totally against type as a gay con man) while still appearing in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Smith's film career took off with his role in Bad Boys (1995) along with co-star Martin Lawrence.After The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air ended in 1996, Smith began a successful solo music career while simultaneously starring in a series of films. The first two films were hugely successful summer blockbusters: Independence Day (1996), in which he played a fearless and confident fighter pilot, and Men in Black (1997), where he played the comic and confident Agent J against Tommy Lee Jones's deadpan Agent K. Smith's acting in Men in Black won critical praise. The two films established Smith's commercial reputation as a bankable star whose appeal across age, race, and gender lines could "open" a film at the box office. Because his movies usually open during the July 4th weekend, many people have come to call a July 4th weekend in which Will Smith stars in a movie "Big Willie Weekend."Lead roles in Enemy of the State, Wild Wild West, Ali, Men in Black II Bad Boys II and "I, Robot" then followed. He also starred in 2005's Hitch. (Like Smith, Hitch co-star Kevin James starred in a sitcom named for royalty, The King of Queens.) His 2006 role is that of Chris Gardner in the "inspired by a true story", "The Pursuit of Happyness" was nominated for, "Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role" an Oscar in 2007. Smith's son Jaden also stars in the movie.(Jaden Smith as of 2010 lately played the lead role of Dre Parker in the 2010 remake of "The Karate Kid".) Will Smith's latest acting role was "Seven Pounds" in 2008 where he played Ben Thomas an IRS agent. Since then he's been producing movies that include, "The Karate Kid"(2010), "The Human Contract"(2009), and "Lakeview Terrace"(2008)Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of the boxer Muhammad Ali in Ali.Smith also released a string of hit singles, often associated with his most recent film, throughout the late 1990s. The most notable of these were his #1 hit theme song "Men in Black," the #1 hit "Gettin' Jiggy Wit It" (which made jiggy a catchphrase for a while in 1998), and "Just the Two of Us," an affecting message to his young son. His first two solo albums went platinum, but his third, on Columbia Records, was a sales disappointment compared to his past efforts, and after a quick Greatest Hits release that was almost not advertised at all, he was dropped by the label. He signed a recording contract with Interscope Records and released the successful Lost and Found in 2005. The album was propelled solely on the smash hit single, "Switch," which appealed to the mainstream media ala "Summertime." The single stayed atop the charts for months and returned Smith to the forefront of Hip Hop.Also, on February 6, 2005 he appeared in the Super Bowl XXX.On July 2, 2005, Smith served as host for the Live 8 concert in his native Philadelphia before an enormous crowd, and later performed a set with DJ Jazzy Jeff.Smith married actress Sharee Zampino in 1992. They had a son, Willard Christopher III, also known as "Trey", but divorced in 1995. Smith married actress Jada Pinkett in 1997. Together they have two children: Jaden Christopher Syre (born 1998) and Willow Camille Reign (born 2000). Along with his brother, Harry Smith, he owns Treyball Development Inc., a Beverly Hills-based company named after his first son. He has been consistently listed in Fortune Magazine's "Richest 40" list of the forty wealthiest Americans under the age of 40.Will Smith has been criticized for his lip service to his home town of Philadelphia, PA. Several of his songs talk about parts of Philadelphia and the surrounding areas. While he has spoken over the years about how much he loves the city and how much he wants to give back, none of his proposed ventures in the city of Philadelphia have ever been developed. He has proposed opening a restaurant, several upscale bars, and a community center in Philadelphia which have never seen development.Version 18, edited byspookybazookyon 28 March 2022, 10:03am·View version historyView version historyEdit this wikiArtist descriptions on Last.fm are editable by everyone.

He formed an alliance with schoolmate and deejayJeffrey Townes, whom he met in 1981. They began recording as DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince and released their first single, “Girls Ain’t Nothing but Trouble,” in 1986, later followed by the albumRock the House. In 1988 the group released the groundbreaking single “Parents Just Don’t Understand,” which went on to win aGrammy Award(the first Grammy ever presented in the rap performance category).Britannica QuizOscar-Worthy Movie TriviaSmith’s act, notable for its wide crossover appeal, was sometimes characterized as “light rap” because of the lack of hard-core lyrics and themes in hiscompositions. Platinum-certified recordings and accompanying videos subsequently brought him to the attention of television producers. The televisionsitcomThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, which began in 1990, was loosely based on Smith’s real-life persona. It ran onNBCfor six successful seasons, ending at the star’s request, and during its run Smith garnered twoGolden Globe Awardnominations and served as an executive producer for the final season.Buoyed by his small-screen success, Smith expanded intocinemawithWhere the Day Takes You(1992). His first leading role was in the film version ofJohn Guare’s successful stage playSix Degrees of Separation(1993). The action comedy-thrillerBad Boys(1995), however, proved to be the turning point in his film career. While the movie was not a critical success, it made more than $100 million worldwide, proving Smith’s star power. In 1996 he starred in that year’s top-grossing movie,Independence Day. He was a hit at the box office again the next year with the science-fictioncomedyMen in Black, for which he also recorded the Grammy-winning title song; sequels to the film appeared in 2002 and 2012. Also in 1997 Smith released his first solo album,Big Willie Style, which included the hit “Gettin’ Jiggy wit It,” and he followed it two years later withWillennium.Will Smith inI, RobotAfter starring in the dramatic thrillerEnemy of the State(1998), Smith continued to demonstrate his remarkable versatility as an actor, playing anenigmaticgolf caddy inThe Legend of Bagger Vance(2000); the boxerMuhammad Aliin the biopicAli(2001), for which he received anAcademy Awardnomination; a cop from the near future inI, Robot(2004); and a “date doctor” helping a romantically inept man find love inHitch(2005). The next year he starred inThe Pursuit of Happyness, and his performance as a single father who overcomes adversity earned him a second Oscar nomination for best actor. InI Am Legend(2007), Smith appeared as a scientist who is perhaps the last human on Earth following anepidemic.Hancock(2008) featured Smith as a superhero trying to revamp his unpopular image, and inSeven Pounds(2008) he played a man seeking redemption after accidentally killing seven people in a car accident.Smith later starred—alongside his son Jaden—in the science-fiction epicAfter Earth(2013), which was based on an idea he conceived. In 2015 Smith portrayed a con artist in the thrillerFocusand the doctor who discovered the epidemic ofchronic traumatic encephalopathy(CTE) amongNFLplayers inConcussion. In 2016 he played the assassin Deadshot in the action thrillerSuicide Squadand agrievingfather inCollateral Beauty. The following year he starred as a police officer in theNetflixaction filmBright, which is set in aLos Angelesinhabited by humans and mythical creatures. Smith then was cast as the genie in the family comedyAladdin(2019). He played two roles inGemini Man(2019): a retired assassin and his younger clone, the latter a digitally recreated version of Smith in his 20s. Smith’s other credits from 2019 included the animatedSpies in Disguise, in which he supplied the voice of a spy who is turned into a pigeon.Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.Subscribe NowWill SmithSmith then starred inBad Boys for Life(2020), a sequel to his 1995 breakthrough film. In 2021 Smith took the title role inKing Richard, a biopic about the father of tennis starsSerenaandVenusWilliams. For his performance, Smith received the Oscar for best actor in 2022. However, his win was partly overshadowed by an incident during the ceremony. When comedianChris Rockmade a joke about Smith’s wife, actressJada Pinkett Smith(married 1997), Smith took offense. He walked onstage and slapped Rock, then swore at him. Smith subsequently apologized to Rock. Later in 2022 Smith starred in Antoine Fuqua’sEmancipation, adramaset during theAmerican Civil War. Smith played an enslaved man who flees the brutality of aConfederaterailroad camp.Smith continued his recording career with the albumsBorn to Reign(2002) andLost and Found(2005), but they failed to match the success of his previous releases. In addition, in the early 21st century Smith served as a producer for several films, including some in which he acted, and with his wife he helped create and produce the sitcomAll of Us(2003–07). In 2018 he hosted the documentary TV seriesOne Strange Rock, about Earth. Smith’s memoir,Will(written with Mark Manson), was released in 2021.The Editors of Encyclopaedia BritannicaThis article was most recently revised and updated byAmy Tikkanen.

Smith starred on the sitcomThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Airfor six seasons, before establishing himself as a Hollywood A-lister withBad Boys(1995) andIndependence Day(1996). He has since headlined such popular films asMen in Black(1997) andHitch(2005) and earned Oscar nominations forAli(2001) andThe Pursuit of Happyness(2006). Smith also earned acclaim forConcussion(2015), before returning to action fare withSuicide Squad(2016).Early LifeSmith was born Willard Carroll Smith Jr. on September 25, 1968, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to mother Caroline, a school board employee, and father Willard C. Smith, a refrigeration company owner. His middle-class upbringing saw him attend the strict Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic School, despite his family's observation of the Baptist faith. He went on to attend Overbrook High School.His West Philadelphia neighborhood was a melting pot of cultures where Orthodox Jews co-existed with a large Muslim population. Smith was a good student whose charming personality and quick tongue were renowned for getting him out of trouble, a trait for which he soon gained the nickname "Prince.''Smith began rapping at age 12, emulating heroes like Grandmaster Flash but tingeing his rhymes with a comedic element that would later become his trademark. At 16 Smith met future collaborator Jeff Townes at a party. The pair became friends, and the duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince was born.Music CareerAs teens, DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince began producing music but steered clear of the gangsta rap sound that was emerging from the West Coast by groups like N.W.A. The Fresh Prince rapped about teenage preoccupations in a clean, curse-free style that middle America found safe and entertaining. The pair's first single, "Girls Ain't Nothing But Trouble," was a hit in 1986. Their 1987 debut album,Rock the House, hit the Billboard Top 200, and made Smith a millionaire before the age of 18. The early success put any thoughts of attending college out of Smith's mind.Early on, it was reported that Smith had turned down a scholarship to Boston's elite Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but Smith later dispelled the rumor when he told an interviewer: "My mother, who worked for the School Board of Philadelphia, had a friend who was the admissions officer at MIT. I had pretty high SAT scores and they needed Black kids, so I probably could have gotten in. But I had no intention of going to college."In 1988, DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince continued their success with the albumHe's The DJ,I'm The Rapper. Featuring the radio-friendly singles "Parents Just Don't Understand," "Brand New Funk," and "Nightmare on My Street," the album won the first-ever Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance. It was followed in 1989 byAnd In This Corner...,which continued the pair's rise to stardom.Movies and TV Shows'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'Two years later, Smith began his crossover into acting. Drawing on his experiences with fledgling stardom, NBC signed Smith to headline a sitcom about a street-smart kid from Philadelphia who moves in with stuffy relatives in the posh Los Angeles neighborhood of Bel-Air. Playing on his rapper persona, and at times featuring his friend Towne,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Airwas a huge success that ran for six seasons.Meanwhile, Smith and Towne continued producing music, their 1991 albumHomebaseproducing the hits "Summertime" and "Ring My Bell." Their final album together, 1993'sCode Red, was notable for "Boom! Shake the Room."'Where the Day Takes You' and 'Six Degrees of Separation'While still makingThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Smith began a second crossover into movies. Small roles in the dramaWhere The Day Takes You(1992) and the comedyMade In America(1993) were followed by a critically acclaimed lead inSix Degrees of Separation(1993). Holding his own alongsideDonald Sutherland, Stockard Channing andIan McKellen, Smith played a street-wise gay hustler who cons his way through elite circles.'Bad Boys'Smith's first steps into superstardom came with his next film,Bad Boys(1995). The high-budget cop movie saw him team up with comicMartin Lawrence, breaking away from the Black-cop-white-cop formula that had been so successful forBeverly Hills Copand theLethal Weaponseries. The two Black leads proved an instant success and Smith — playing the smooth lady killer to Lawrence's clown — was established as leading man material.'Independence Day'Smith next took on the epic sci-fi flickIndependence Day(1996), a role that confirmed him as a major player in Hollywood and the go-to guy for summer blockbusters. He played a pilot leading the counterattack against invading alien forces, and his comedic talents effortlessly transformed into the pithy one-liners all action heroes need to be able to drop while dispatching their enemies.'Men in Black' and 'Enemy of the State'Smith fought aliens again in his next blockbuster, the comic sci-fi action film,Men in Black(1997). Playing oppositeTommy Lee Jones, Smith chewed up the screen as the new recruit to Jones' old hand. Smith rapped the theme song, and its inclusion on his 1997 solo album,Big Willie Style,brought the multi-talented actor more success. Another blockbuster followed with the slick conspiracy thrillerEnemy of the State(1998), which earned Smith an NAACP Image Award nomination for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture.'Wild Wild West' and 'The Legend of Bagger Vance'The string of hits came to an end in 1999 withWild Wild West, a sci-fi cowboy Western co-starring Kevin Kline. Despite the film's lackluster box-office performance, the track Smith cut for the film became a hit on his 1999 album,Willennium. The golf movieThe Legend of Bagger Vance(2000) was his next big film, with Smith playing the caddie toMatt Damon's out-of-sorts swinger.Oscar Nomination for 'Ali'The 2001 biopicAli, based on boxing legendMuhammad Ali, gave Smith the opportunity to regain his big-screen swagger. His turn as the charismatic boxing great saw Smith put in the performance of his life, training and disciplining himself to extraordinary lengths to do justice to the athleticism — and ego — of the titular character. The film underwhelmed at the box office despite a record-breaking opening day, but Smith's performance was strong enough to garner him his first Academy Award nomination.'Men in Black II,' 'Bad Boys II' and 'I, Robot'A couple of sequels were next, with Smith reprising his roles inMen In Black II(2002) andBad Boys II(2003). Neither was a flop, but neither matched the impressive box-office take of its predecessor. Staying with the sci-fi action theme, Smith moved on toI, Robotin 2004. The Isaac Asimov adaptation featured Smith as a futuristic cop investigating a murder by a robot and then battling a robot insurgency. The film performed well, grossing more than $144 million domestically.'Hitch' and 'The Pursuit of Happyness'Smith's smooth-talking charmer persona was put to use in the 2005 romantic comedyHitch,playing a dating consultant who helps luckless guys with their romantic moves. Smith also penned the theme song and included it on his 2005 album,Lost and Found.Hitchwas a massive success, and it was followed in 2006 by another critical and financial hit,The Pursuit of Happyness(2006). Starring alongside his real-life sonJaden, Smith captivated audiences with the story of a single father who has to build a life from scratch. He received his second Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his performance.'I Am Legend'In 2007, Smith starred inI Am Legend, a remake of the Charlton Heston filmOmega Man, in which he battled bloodthirsty vampires. The film became a national and international hit.'Hancock,' 'Seven Pounds,' and 'Men in Black 3'Smith then took on the dual role of actor and producer forHancock(2008), in which he played an alcoholic anti-superhero, and forSeven Pounds(2008), about a man who sets out to change the lives of seven people. He also helped produce two more films released that year,Lakeview TerraceandThe Secret Life of Bees.After a hiatus, Smith returned to the big screen in 2012 withMen in Black 3, followed by a turn as a military commander in the critically panned M. Night Shyamalan sci-fi flickAfter Earth, which co-starred Smith's son Jaden. He then made a cameo as Lucifer in the filmWinter's Tale(2014).'Focus,' 'Concussion,' 'Suicide Squad'Smith's next leading role came with the 2015 heist caperFocus, co-starringMargot Robbie. Later in the year, he starred asDr. Bennet Omaluin the sports dramaConcussion, earning a Golden Globe nomination for his role as a doctor fighting to raise awareness about head trauma in NFL players.In 2016, Smith starred in the DC Comics blockbuster hitSuicide Squad, which became his most successful film since 1996'sIndependence Day. The same year, he also took on a more somber role as a father who loses his young daughter in the dramaCollateral Beauty. Although a follow-up endeavor,Bright(2017), was thoroughly panned by critics, audiences responded more positively to the urban fantasy crime flick.'Aladdin,' 'Gemini Man' and 'Bad Boys for Life'In February 2019, Smith announced that he would not be returning for theSuicide Squadsequel. Around that time, a commercial during the Grammy Awards revealed him as a wisecracking Genie in Guy Ritchie's live-action adaptation of Disney'sAladdin, which went on to top $1 billion at the global box office. Next up was Ang Lee'sGemini Man, which had Smith pulling double duty — with help from digital technology — as a 50-year-old assassin assigned to kill a 23-year-old version of himself.The A-lister closed out the year by voicing super agent Lance Sterling in the animatedSpies in Disguise, alongsideTom Holland, before opening 2020 with a return to his successful cop-buddy franchise inBad Boys for Life.Personal LifeSmith has been married twice.

He has enjoyed success in television, film, and music. In April 2007, Newsweek called him "the most powerful actor in Hollywood". Smith has been nominated for five Golden Globe Awards, two Academy Awards, and has won four Grammy Awards.In the late 1980s, Smith achieved modest fame as a rapper under the name The Fresh Prince. In 1990, his popularity increased dramatically when he starred in the popular television series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The show ran for six seasons (1990-96) on NBC and has been syndicated consistently on various networks since then. After the series ended, Smith moved from television to film, and ultimately starred in numerous blockbuster films. He is the only actor to have eight consecutive films gross over $100 million in the domestic box office, eleven consecutive films gross over $150 million internationally, and eight consecutive films in which he starred open at the number one spot in the domestic box office tally.Smith is ranked as the most bankable star worldwide by Forbes. As of 2014, 17 of the 21 films in which he has had leading roles have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of over $100 million each, five taking in over $500 million each in global box office receipts. As of 2014, his films have grossed $6.6 billion at the global box office. He has received Best Actor Oscar nominations for Ali and The Pursuit of Happyness.Smith was born in West Philadelphia, the son of Caroline (Bright), a Philadelphia school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith, Sr., a refrigeration engineer. He grew up in West Philadelphia's Wynnefield neighborhood, and was raised Baptist. He has three siblings, sister Pamela, who is four years older, and twins Harry and Ellen, who are three years younger. Smith attended Our Lady of Lourdes, a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia. His parents separated when he was 13, but did not actually divorce until around 2000.Smith attended Overbrook High School. Though widely reported, it is untrue that Smith turned down a scholarship to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); he never applied to college because he "wanted to rap." Smith says he was admitted to a "pre-engineering [summer] program" at MIT for high school students, but he did not attend. According to Smith, "My mother, who worked for the School Board of Philadelphia, had a friend who was the admissions officer at MIT. I had pretty high SAT scores and they needed black kids, so I probably could have gotten in. But I had no intention of going to college."Smith started as the MC of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, with his childhood friend Jeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townes as producer, as well as Ready Rock C (Clarence Holmes) as the human beat box. The trio was known for performing humorous, radio-friendly songs, most notably "Parents Just Don't Understand" and "Summertime". They gained critical acclaim and won the first Grammy awarded in the Rap category (1988).Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes. The Internal Revenue Service eventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and garnished his income. Smith was nearly bankrupt in 1990, when the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him.The show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming "the biggest movie star in the world", studying box office successes' common characteristics.Smith's first major roles were in the drama Six Degrees of Separation (1993) and the action film Bad Boys (1995) in which he starred opposite Martin Lawrence.In 1996, Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast in Roland Emmerich's Independence Day. The film was a massive blockbuster, becoming the second highest grossing film in history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw. He later struck gold again in the summer of 1997 alongside Tommy Lee Jones in the summer hit Men in Black playing Agent J. In 1998, Smith starred with Gene Hackman in Enemy of the State.He turned down the role of Neo in The Matrix in favor of Wild Wild West (1999). Despite the disappointment of Wild Wild West, Smith has said that he harbors no regrets about his decision, asserting that Keanu Reeves's performance as Neo was superior to what Smith himself would have achieved, although in interviews subsequent to the release of Wild Wild West he stated that he "made a mistake on Wild Wild West. That could have been better."In 2005, Smith was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for attending three premieres in a 24-hour time span.He has planned to star in a feature film remake of the television series It Takes a Thief.On December 10, 2007, Smith was honored at Grauman's Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard. Smith left an imprint of his hands and feet outside the world-renowned theater in front of many fans. Later that month, Smith starred in the film I Am Legend, released December 14, 2007. Despite marginally positive reviews, its opening was the largest ever for a film released in the United States during December. Smith himself has said that he considers the film to be "aggressively unique". A reviewer said that the film's commercial success "cemented [Smith's] standing as the number one box office draw in Hollywood." On December 1, 2008, TV Guide reported that Smith was selected as one of America's top ten most fascinating people of 2008 for a Barbara Walters ABC special that aired on December 4, 2008.In 2008 Smith was reported to be developing a film entitled The Last Pharaoh, in which he would be starring as Taharqa. It was in 2008 that Smith starred in the superhero movie Hancock.Men in Black III opened on May 25, 2012 with Smith again reprising his role as Agent J. This was his first major starring role in four years.On August 19, 2011, it was announced that Smith had returned to the studio with producer La Mar Edwards to work on his fifth studio album. Edwards has worked with artists such as T.I., Chris Brown, and Game. Smith's most recent studio album, Lost and Found, was released in 2005.Smith and his son Jaden played father and son in two productions: the 2006 biographical drama The Pursuit of Happyness, and the science fiction film After Earth, which was released on May 31, 2013.Smith starred opposite Margot Robbie in the romance drama Focus. He played Nicky Spurgeon, a veteran con artist who takes a young, attractive woman under his wing. Focus was released on February 27, 2015. Smith was set to star in the Sci-Fic thriller Brilliance, an adaptation of Marcus Sakey's novel of the same name scripted by Jurassic Park writer David Koepp. But he left the project.Smith played Dr. Bennet Omalu of the Brain Injury Research Institute in the sports-drama Concussion, who became the first person to discover chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in a football player's brain. CTE is a degenerative disease caused by severe trauma to the head that can be discovered only after death. Smith's involvement is mostly due to his last-minute exit from the Sci-Fi thriller-drama Brilliance. Concussion was directed by Peter Landesman and-bead filmed in Pittsburgh, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. It received $14.4 million in film tax credits from Pennsylvania. Principal photography started on October 27, 2014. Actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw played his wife.

I would memorize the entire script, then I'd be lipping everybody's lines while they were talking. When I watch those episodes, it's disgusting. My performances were horrible."On the change in his body that Ali's intense physical training required: "I'm human viagra. I'm Willagra. I'm a sex machine now. I'm raring to go every second of the day. My wife's loving it."My biggest emotional defeat and the greatest emotional pain I've had as an actor was when 'Wild Wild West' opened up to $52 million. The movie wasn't good. And it hurt so bad to be the No. 1 movie, to open at $52 million and to know the movie wasn't good.I want to stop at five - when asked byJules Asnerabout having more children.When I turned 28, everything clicked. I even got way better in bed.It's a whole different thing being an actor. A rapper is about being completely true to yourself. Being an actor is about changing who you are. You make yourself a different person. You become a different person.You're so much stronger when your partner is strong. I honestly believe there is no woman for me but Jada. Of all the women I've met - and there've been a few - no one can handle me the way Jada does. Once you feel someone locked in on you, it's no contest. As fine as other women can be, as tempting sexually, I'm not going anywhere. This is it. I can't imagine what anyone else could offer.I love being black in America, and especially being black in Hollywood.I really believe that a man and a woman together, raising a family, is the purest form of happiness we can experience.If you're not willing to work hard, let someone else do it. I'd rather be with someone who does a horrible job, but gives 110% than with someone who does a good job and gives 60%.People laugh, but if I set my mind to it, within the next 15 years I would be president.My grandmother once told me, 'Don't let failure go to your heart and don't let success go to your head.'[onStar Wars(1977)] "I might have been eight or nine. That was the movie that put me into a space where the science fiction element was almost a spiritual connection for me. I thought, if someone could imagine that and then put it on a screen and make me feel like that... and my entire career I've been trying to make people feel likeStar Wars(1977) made me feel."AboutAishwarya Rai Bachchan: "I really wanted to work with her inHitch(2005) but she was shootingBride & Prejudice(2004) at the time and she couldn't do it. She has this powerful energy where she doesn't have to say anything, do anything, she can just stand there. Anything she's making, I'll be there" (February 2006).If I weren't a musician/actor, I'd be a computer engineer. I was always good at math. I probably would have been the guy who invented the remote control if I'd been around then.When I started in movies, I said, 'I want to be the biggest movie star in the world.' The biggest movie stars make the biggest movies, so [my producing partnerJames Lassiterand I] looked at the top 10 movies of all time. At that point, they were all special-effects movies. SoIndependence Day(1996), no-brainer.Men in Black(1997), no-brainer.I, Robot(2004), no-brainer.[on refusing to kissAnthony Michael HallinSix Degrees of Separation(1993)] It was very immature on my part. I was thinking, 'How are my friends in Philly going to think about this?' I wasn't emotionally stable enough to artistically commit to that aspect of the film. In a movie with actors and a director and writer of this caliber, for me to be the one bringing something cheesy to it... This was a valuable lesson for me. Either you do it or you don't.Give me a problem, I'll give you a solution. I just love living. That's a feeling you can't fake. I'm glad every single day. I think that even the camera can feel that I'm a happy man.(1996) I was nine and my older sister must have been 15. Some guys pulled a knife on me and took my money when I was coming home from school. I came in crying and my sister asked me why. I told her and she right away grabbed a baseball bat. We walked around for four hours looking for this guy. She had no concern for her own safety. Somebody had done something to her brother and she was going to do everything in her power to make sure they never did it again. We never found the guys, but that type of love and commitment is what I search for. My mother and my grandmother. That same kind of unconditional love. All women have the organs. But that's not what excites me about being in a relationship with women, that's not what makes me feel good. What I want to know is, 'Are you gonna grab a bat when someone steals my money?' Now, Miss Jada's so little, she might need two bats, but she's more than happy to go grab 'em. Outside of our love relationship, she's my best friend, too.(1996, Movieline Magazine) There's probably only four women in Los Angeles that have intimate knowledge of Will Smith. You know, I had my brief period, a short time in my life, but that got real old real quick. I want to love somebody. I just always prefer one woman. The intimacy is so much more enjoyable when it's with someone you love. Because I know I can pretty much have sex with anyone I choose, it becomes less appealing. It's no challenge. A successful relationship is much harder than sleeping with as many women as you can sleep with.(1996, on fame) There are members of the press who make their living infringing on people's private moments. You never know where these people are going to be. They stay outside your house and climb the gates and walk around looking in your windows. Now I've got a bunch of 140-pound Rottweilers. It's just a shame to have to live like that, because I like people so much. Still, you don't know what people will do. You can never feel completely safe. You've got to look around all the time. I'm kind of used to that, being black, watching out for white people coming to get you. Now it's tenfold...I'm having trouble dealing with the concept that you sacrifice your right to courtesy by being a celebrity. Because I'm a celebrity, someone is allowed to block my way from getting into my car. If I'm in the middle of a conversation, because I'm a celebrity, someone can come up to me and go, 'Can you sign this?' You're supposed to do the nice thing and sign, because if you don't, it's like, 'He's such an asshole. He doesn't sign autographs.' You're in mid-gulp at a restaurant and people ask you to put down your fork, take some dirty pen that you have no idea of where it's been, sign some filthy piece of paper ripped off a paper bag they found outside, then go back and put your hands in your food.(1996, on fame) I'm pretty good at diffusing potential situations, but I find myself having to diffuse them a lot more often than before. I heardSylvester Stallonesay once that after he madeRocky(1976), everybody wanted to fight him. Well, every big guy wants to fight me now. They go. 'Yo. I ain't no alien-hit me,' and I'm like, 'I don't want to hit you. I just want to get some cheese from the supermarket to make grilled cheese sandwiches for my son.' Why do people want to fight me? What did I do? I think of myself as a pretty calm, likable guy. It's really weird. I was nonthreatening on 'The Fresh Prince,' so nobody wanted to fight me, but then I buffed up for Independence Day, came on a little cocky, and suddenly people want to knock me down. People who know me from TV think I've seen them in their underwear drinking on their couch, so the response is more familiar, more friendly. Film gives you almost God status, you know? It makes people crazy.(1996, on fame) I was in Manhattan makingMen in Black(1997) and this girl was driving along, saw me and started mouthing over and over, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,' then crashed into another car." Smith shakes his head in amazement. "Now, she gets out of her car, but she doesn't say, "Oh. I crashed into the back of a car!' She runs over to me and asks for my autograph. That's when I thought: This is real different. Then, I was at the Virgin Megastore in Manhattan and this girl came up to me, pulled her shirt up and asked me to sign her breasts with a Sharpie. I mean, she's standing there in the middle of the store with her titties hanging out and I'm like, 'Listen, those are really nice breasts, but this is really an inappropriate time and place.' In another store, this toothless 80-year-old lady came up to me, grabbed my face and tried to kiss me right on the lips. I said, 'Now, ma'am, if I walked up to you, grabbed your face and tried to kiss you on the mouth, the cops would give me a Rodney King and take me right to jail.' And she was like, 'Oh, stop being mean. Just give me a kiss.'(1996) As for my life right now, the picture I always see in my mind is of that incredible game Michael Jordan had where he had 63 points. He just turned to the TV cameras and shrugged, like, 'Hey, I'm just throwing 'em up there and they're going in.' That's how I feel. I'd love to say that I'm brilliant, that I'm the second coming. The real answer is that I'm blessed. I throw 'em up from wherever I am and they just keep going in. How cool is that?(1996) I'm above average in talent, but where I think I excel is psychotic drive. All I need is for somebody to say I can't do something and this crazy switch inside me makes me attack whatever I'm doing. Psychotic drive is where I excel over people that are probably more naturally gifted.As a child I watched 'Dallas', and that was the vision for my life as long as I can remember. The property had a name! It was called 'Southfork'. How does a property have a name? Ours was just 'Row House'.(1996) In film and TV, there's a natural, gradual decline to your career. In the music business, it's literally one day. The day your record hits the radio, you explode to number one on the countdown. You're the man, you're large, you're doing show after show. Then you're over just that fast. I had the ups of people telling me, 'You're the man, Will.' then the downs of selling your house because you can't afford all this stuff you bought because everybody told you were the man. The money disappeared. But, my God, I learned about myself because I had the ups and all the downs...I've been in really ugly situations, hostage situations, on the road with my music. You know, you get out to Albany, Georgia and the promoter didn't make his money, so he doesn't want to pay you. I mean, during the first part of my music career, we signed our first deal with a gangster who later tried to shoot us. He was a penny-ante gangster, but the bullets were for real. As we were driving away, he shot at the car five or six times. It was pretty scary, but you don't think about that while it's happening, you're just trying to get away. He would have killed us if he could actually shoot.[on passing on the role of Django inDjango Unchained(2012)] Django wasn't the lead, so it was like, I need to be the lead. The other character was the lead! I was like, 'No, Quentin, please, I need to kill the bad guy!' I thought it was brilliant. Just not for me.[on turning down the lead role inThe Matrix(1999)] You know, _The Matrix_ is a difficult concept to pitch. In the pitch, I just didn't see it. I watched Keanu's performance - and very rarely do I say this - but I would have messed it up. I would have absolutely messed upThe Matrix(1999). At that point I wasn't smart enough as an actor to let the movie be. Whereas Keanu was smart enough to just let it be. Let the movie and the director tell the story, and don't try and perform every moment.[onJustin Bieber] I talk to Justin once a week, and he is suffering from immature adulthood in the media and surrounding world. He's not doing anything that a normal nineteen-year-old wouldn't want to do and wouldn't need to do to become a man. The transition from boyhood to manhood is a very difficult transition that he's handling on a world stage better than 95 percent of the people who talk shit about him.I love to create. There's something about making movies that just really gets me excited. It's not the movie-making probably as much as the storytelling. I love people being wrapped in a story and being able to deliver that emotional punch line at the end of the story.[in an interview forAfter Earth(2013) talking about what scares him the most in cinema] It's been an absolute necessity that the movie be a blockbuster, but I think I'm going to start moving out of that and finding more danger in my artistic choices.Being realistic is the most commonly traveled road to mediocrity.[Why he and his wife are boycotting the Oscars] When I look at it, the nominations reflect The Academy. The Academy reflects the industry and the industry reflects Hollywood and America. America reflects a series of challenges that we are having in our country at the moment which are on a regressive slide we are having towards separatism, towards racial and religious disharmony and that's not the Hollywood and the America I want to leave behind.[on makingWild Wild West(1999)] I wanted to win and be the biggest movie star, and what happened was there was a lag aroundWild Wild West(1999) at the time. I found myself promoting something because I wanted to win versus promoting something because I believed in it. It's now in the hand of fans. I have to be in tune with their needs and not trick them into going to see Wild Wild West.[on making Wild Wild West] We went out on a limb with a couple of these scenes. I sure hope people think this is funny, because this is one of those setups that can either be hilarious or it can be something people will hate for the rest of their lives...We'll see on Big Willie Weekend what people think.[on why he decided to make Wild Wild West] The first time where it didn't work the way that I wanted was Wild Wild West. I was coming off of Men in Black, and everything was like, 'Oh, we can't lose,' you know? I was like, 'Oh! Tragedy!'... With a movie, it's like you never know; you can love it, you can have done what you think is the best work you've ever done, and you put it out on that Friday, and everybody hates it - and you've taken a year.Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive. My behavior at last night's Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are part of the job, but a joke about Jada's medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally. I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions are not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness. I would also like to apologize to the Academy, the producers of the show, all the attendees and everyone watching around the world. I would like to apologize to the Williams Family and my King Richard Family. I deeply regret that my behavior has stained what has been an otherwise gorgeous journey for all of us.

Then there’s Abbey. The 3-year-old German shepherd, who plays Will Smith’s best friend in the sci-fi epicI Am Legend, took an old-fashioned road to fame: She got discovered. Plucked from a California kennel by Steve Berens, a trainer with 28 years of industry experience, Abbey was exactly the kind of light-colored shepherd thatLegenddirector Francis Lawrence had been looking for. The film, set five years in the future, tells the story of a scientist (Smith) who struggles to survive in a postapocalyptic New York City with only his four-legged pal, Sam (Abbey), for company. It was a demanding part, and Berens knew it would take more than a few Method classes to get his new protégé ready for the camera. ”We were pretty much starting from scratch,” he recalls. ”She didn’t even know her own name.”Three weeks of intensive coaching followed before Abbey was ready to meet her costar. Sparks flew instantly: ”Will came walking up, and Abbey barked at him,” recalls Berens. But Smith patiently earned Abbey’s respect, and the two headed to New York City for a grueling six-month shoot for the film, which is based on a 1954 vampire novel of the same name.A consummate professional on set (she declined fur and makeup and ate a strict diet of kibble and chicken), Abbey balked only when asked to perform a particularly degrading act for one scene. ”For whatever reason, she just had no interest in playing fetch,” says Lawrence (Constantine). ”We had to use a backup dog.” But even the occasional diva moment couldn’t diminish the cast and crew’s love for their leading lady. ”When we finished her last shot, it was like the whole crew had been dying for six months to pet her,” recalls Lawrence. ”Everybody swarmed. She loved it.”I Am LegendtypeMoviempaaruntime100 minutesdirectorFrancis LawrenceCommentsClose this dialog windowShare & MoreEW.comMagazines & MoreLearn MoreSubscribethis link opens in a new tabAdvertisethis link opens in a new tabConnectSubscribe to Our NewsletterMeredith© Copyright 2023 Meredith Corporation.

In the movie, he had a dog named Sam as his only companion. Things don’t end well for Sam in the film as he was bitten by infected dogs. Off the camera, Will was very enamoured by the German Shephard, whose real name is Abbey. He wanted to adopt Abbey and keep her with himself, but unfortunately, the dog’s trainer was not very keen on the idea. He refused to let go of Abbey and Will was left heartbroken.When Will Smith fell in love with his furry co-starWill Smith was definitely smitten by Abbey during the filming of the movie. In an interview with Today, he said, “I love that dog.” He spoke about him begging the crew members to let him keep the dog but unfortunately, that wasn’t how it was supposed to be. He jokingly said, “But you know she has her own family, so it was just another one of those fleeting Hollywood romances." Will Smith even went on ‘dates’ with Abbey before the filming started just so that they can both get comfortable with each other and get to know one another well. The movie’s animal trainer found Abbey in a kennel. She looked the part but was not trained for filming. It took him few weeks to get her up to speed with the shooting.Abbey helped Will Smith overcome his reserved nature towards dogs during the filming of the movie.

I don’t know why, really, because I don’t recall ever having a bad experience with them. Now, I can recall having very many great experiences with them – and a lot of fun.“When we were shooting a movie calledI Am Legend, I had to work closely with a German Shepherd called Abbey, who was playing the part of Sam, a young dog given to my character by my screen daughter who died in the story. So, Abbey and I spent a lot of time together. She was big and bouncy, but looked great, and I wanted to get close to her.“Abbey’s owner and trainer, Steve Berens, patiently introduced us and gave us confidence in each other. That was it! I was with her all the time and we became the best of friends. I liked having her around and when the movie production ended, I wanted to keep her. I was no longer nervous of any sort of dog and kind of fell in love with her. Steve was also attached to her, though, and so she stayed with him. He did say that we had bonded really well, which was nice to hear. It was the end of the movie, but the start of a different approach to dogs for me.”…Read the full interview by Bernard Bale in theFebruary issueTAGSFebruary issueGerman ShepherdInterviewRottweilerFacebookTwitterGoogle+PinterestWhatsAppPrevious article“Is it OK that I’ve never bathed my dog?”Next articleShih Tzu hoping 2020 will be his year to find a forever homeMaria LakenDog lover and animal welfare supporter, who has had previous experience in the magazine industry and has been writing for Dogs Monthly since 2018.

It used to be just Jada, and now Jaden is starting to yearn for Christmas time," Will explained. "He's got pajamas with footies for Christmas -- like, he's taking it too serious. We need some family time so he can deal with that.""See, here's the deal: So, for the last probably 20 years, Jada has been bat raving looney about Christmas. Like, she goes really, really far with Christmas, and up until now, it's been like, us against her for Christmas, just to keep a little family sanity around Christmas," he added. "But now, Jaden is starting to flip to the other side, so I'm concerned that my family is going to go real Christmas wacky."The red carpet alone was proof of how busy Will's family is. Jaden accompanied his dad to the premiere after performing a mini-concert on the red carpet in support of his new album,Syre, and Will's eldest son, Trey Smith, was on his way. Jada spent the evening at home and their daughter, Willow Smith, was working.Kevin Winter/Getty ImagesAs for the movie itself, Will told ET he was "excited to just take this leap with Netflix.""It's a whole new world in terms of the way human beings are going to consume entertainment and information and all of that, and this is a really different kind of idea, different way to do it. Judging by the red carpet it's not any smaller than [theaterical releases]."Frazer Harrison/Getty ImagesBright, streaming Dec. 22, stars Will, Joel Edgerton, Noomi Rapace, Edgar Ramirez and Lucy Fry and is directed bySuicide Squad's David Ayer. Itmay be the first installmentin a franchise about a fantastical world that looks a lot like modern-day L.A., where the police force is composed of humans and orcs, magic is outlawed and fairies are on the run.A magical Will Smith?

"For different reasons, those are the two almost perfect movies."Men in Black was released in 1997 and the sci-fi comedy follows the titular secret organization that supervises alien lifeforms who live on Earth and hides their existence from humans. The movie has a rating of 92% on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, the highest of all Smith's movies. Two sequels followed 2002 and 2012, but these are... not as highly rated, shall we say.The Pursuit of Happyness followed in 2006 and sees Smith play a homeless salesman and the father to his real-life son, Jaden. He was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for his performance.And as for his worst movie? "For worst, I don't know, Wild Wild West is just a thorn in my side," Smith added. "To see myself with chaps… I don't like it." The steampunk Western came out in 1999 and was the most expensive movie ever made at the time of its release (when costs are adjusted for inflation). It didn't do well at the box office and won five Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture. Worst of all, Smith passed on a leading role in The Matrix to appear in Wild Wild West.Smith's next big-screen outing should be more successful, however – he plays the lead in King Richard, which centers around the father of tennis superstars Serena and Venus Williams. The movie arrives in theaters and on HBO Max on November 19.

While promoting his upcoming film King Richard, the 53-year-old megastar looked back at his career and revealed his picks of his best and worst roles.“For the best, I think it is a tie between the first ‘Men In Black’ and ‘The Pursuit Of Happyness’. For different reasons, those are the two almost perfect movies,” the Aladdin actor said. Picking his worst, Smith quickly chose Wild Wild West, saying “it’s just a thorn in my side. To see myself with chaps… I don’t like it.”If you didn’t know, the film Wild Wild West, which also starred Kevin Kline and Salma Hayek, received abysmal reviews back when it was released and was nominated for eight Razzie awards and took home five following its release in 1999.Later on, in the same interview, the actor spoke about his personal life and broke his silence on wife Jada Pinket Smith’s extra-marital affair. He said: “Jada never believed in conventional marriage.… Jada had family members that had an unconventional relationship. So she grew up in a way that was very different than how I grew up. There were significant endless discussions about, what is relational perfection? What is the perfect way to interact as a couple? And for the large part of our relationship, monogamy was what we chose, not thinking of monogamy as the only relational perfection.”ALSO READ:Will Smith breaks silence on wife Jada Pinkett Smith's affair: I also had relationships outside marriageAbout The AuthorPinkvilla DeskJournalist.

When I heard the name, I was just, 'Yes!'" said the actor's mother in an exclusive interview with 6abc.On Hollywood's biggest night, she got up early and was the first to send a text on the family's special group chat."I started out saying, 'Good morning, we've got to say good luck to Uncle Will," Carolyn Smith recalled.But no one would have predicted how Hollywood's biggest night would unfold.As the Smith family gathered in their family home in the suburbs of Philadelphia, the actor's mother, sisters and others dressed up and gathered around the TV to watch their hero.EMBED <>More VideosBut before the award was announced, there was a very awkward and stunning moment when Will Smith walked up on stage and slapped Chris Rock after the comedian joked about the actor's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, and her struggle with hair loss.The famous actor born and raised in West Philadelphia, who always seemed cool and collected, lost it.Even Smith's mother admits she was surprised."He is a very even, people person. That's the first time I've ever seen him go off. First time in his lifetime...

It's none of your businessThis article is more than 7 years oldDavid MarshShould anyone still be asking this question – or using the phrase ‘maiden name’ at all?Wed 14 Oct 2015 11.37 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 Oct 2015 11.53 EDTAn interesting debate was launched on Twitter when @KenSmith asked whether it was about time we dropped “maiden name” for the gender-neutral “birth name”. The tweet said: “Maiden has a ghostly cargo of Victorian sexual anxiety.”There was an overwhelming consensus that “maiden name” seems outdated at best and, for most people, sexist. A few comments:“Name before which marriage? I’ve been married, widowed and married again, keeping my own name always.” (@Bentonbag)“Archaic and inaccurate. I was most definitely not a ‘maiden’ when I married. Didn’t change my name either.” (@JemmaD)“The anglophone obsession with ‘maiden name’ is a window to the origin of marriage: trade of women for goods.” (@thisisredundant)“I’m always baffled when my bank asks me my mother’s maiden name. How presumptuous to assume she married or changed her name.” (@WilkinsonSamuel)Other people questioned the concept of changing one’s name on marriage at all as outdated. These days the husband sometimes takes the wife’s last name, or they double-barrel it. And with marriage equality, there may be two husbands or two wives, rendering the concept of a “maiden name” even more old-fashioned.My youngest son’s surname comprises my wife’s surname, followed by mine. If a bank ever asks his “mother’s maiden name”, it will be the first half of his own surname. Which doesn’t sound a very secure security question to me.Not everyone was comfortable with “birth name”. Alternative suggestions included “childhood name”, “native name”, “née”, and “original name” or “previous name” which, as @JonathanWest pointed out, “covers all cases of name change, not just to marriage and not just to birth name”.Among the few dissenting voices were those concerned that this attack on “maiden name” was a threat to maiden over and maiden century (in cricket), along with maiden voyage and similar figurative uses. I can’t see any reason why.I agree that “maiden name” is dated and sexist. I hope we can avoid it in the Guardian. Wikipedia favours the style “Jane Smith (born Jane Jones)” and this, when relevant, seems fair enough.It’s sexist to ask a woman (but not a man) her maiden name, or to ask anyone for their mother’s maiden name. It’s none of their business, just its none of their business to know whether a woman is married (“Mrs”) or not (“Miss”) unless she chooses to tell them.“Maiden name” does not take account of equal marriage – a male couple don’t have “maiden names”, a female couple have two, which are probably the names they actually use, so the whole thing becomes as dated as “spinster” or “bachelor girl” – or for that matter “confirmed bachelor” – now sound.It may be a while before we all agree on an alternative, if we ever do, but it seems likely that the phrase “maiden name” is on the way out. And about time too.TopicsLanguageMind your languageblogpostsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedAustraliaCoronavirusWorldAU politicsEnvironmentFootballIndigenous AustraliaImmigrationMediaBusinessScienceTechNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top©2023Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Smith subsequently resigned fromthe Academyand was banned from attending all Academy functions, including the Oscars, for ten years.[14]Early lifeSmith was born and raised inPhiladelphiaas Willard Carroll Smith II on September 25, 1968,  to Caroline (née Bright), a school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith Sr.,[15][16]a US Air Force veteran[17]and refrigeration engineer. His mother graduated fromCarnegie Mellon University.[18]Smith grew up in West Philadelphia'sWynnefieldneighborhood[19]and was raisedBaptist.[20]He has an elder sister named Pamela and two younger siblings, twins Harry and Ellen.[19]He attended Our Lady of Lourdes, a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia,[21]andOverbrook High School.[22]His parents separated when he was 13[23]and divorced around the year 2000.[24]Smith began rapping at age 12. When his grandmother found a notebook of his lyrics, which he described as containing "all [his] little curse words", she wrote him a note on a page in the book: "Dear Willard, truly intelligent people do not have to use words like this to express themselves. Please show the world that you're as smart as we think you are". Smith said that this influenced his decision not to use profanity in his music.[25]CareerFurther information:Will Smith filmography,Will Smith discography, andList of awards and nominations received by Will Smith1985–1992: DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh PrinceSmith at the Emmy Awards 1993Smith started as theMCof the hip-hop duoDJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, with his childhood friendJeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townesasturntablistand producer.[26]Townes and Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smith's residence, and he was missing hishype man. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype man finally made it to the party.[27]Soon after, the two decided to join forces. Smith enlisted a friend to join as the beatboxer of the group, Clarence Holmes akaReady Rock C, making them a trio. Philadelphia-based Word Records released their first single in 1986 whenA&RmanPaul Oakenfold[28]introduced them to Champion Records with their single "Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble," a tale of funny misadventures that landed Smith and his former DJ and rap partner Mark Forrest (Lord Supreme) in trouble.[29]The song sampled the theme song of "I Dream of Jeannie." Smith became known for light-hearted story-telling raps and capable, though profanity-free, "battle" rhymes. The single became a hit a month before Smith graduated from high school.[30]Based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention ofJive RecordsandRussell Simmons. The duo's first album,Rock the House, which was first released on Word Up in 1986 debuted on Jive in March 1987. The group received the firstGrammy Award for Best Rap Performancein 1989 for "Parents Just Don't Understand" (1988), though their most successful single was "Summertime" (1991), which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on theBillboardHot 100. Smith and Townes are still friends and claim that they never split up, having made songs under Smith's solo performer credit.[31]Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes.[26]TheInternal Revenue Serviceeventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, andgarnishedhis income.[32]Smith was struggling financially in 1990 when theNBCtelevision network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him.[26]The show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming "the biggest movie star in the world", studyingbox office successes' common characteristics.[23]In 1989, Smith was arrested in relation to an alleged assault on his record promoter, William Hendricks; the charges were later dismissed.[33]1993–1997: Solo music and film breakthroughSmith's first major roles were in the dramaSix Degrees of Separation(1993) and the action filmBad Boys(1995) in which he starred oppositeMartin Lawrence.

The film was released on July 2 byColumbia Picturesand grossed over $589.3 million worldwide against a $90 million budget, becoming the year's third highest-grossing film, with an estimated 54,616,700 tickets sold in the US.[37]It received positive reviews, with critics praising its humor, as well as Jones's and Smith's performances.During the summer of 1997, Smith also began his solo music career with the release of "Men in Black", the theme song for the film, which topped singles charts in several regions across the world, including the UK.[38]"Men in Black" (and second single "Just Cruisin'") was later included on Smith's debut solo albumBig Willie Style, which reached the top ten of the USBillboard200and was certified nine times platinum by theRecording Industry Association of America(RIAA).[39][40]The third single from the album, "Gettin' Jiggy wit It", became Smith's firstBillboardHot 100number one when it was released in 1998.[41]1998–2007: Leading man statusSmith in 1999In 1998, Smith starred withGene HackmaninEnemy of the State.[26]The following year he turned down the role ofNeoinThe Matrixin favor ofWild Wild West(1999). Despite the disappointment ofWild Wild West, Smith said that he has no regrets about his decision, asserting thatKeanu Reeves's performance as Neo was superior to what Smith himself would have achieved,[42]although in interviews subsequent to the release ofWild Wild Westhe said that he "made a mistake onWild Wild West. That could have been better."[43]Smith's second album was again supported by the release of a film theme song as the lead single: "Wild Wild West", featuringDru HillandKool Moe Dee, topped theBillboardHot 100 and was certified gold by the RIAA.[40][41]The album in question,Willennium, reached number five on theBillboard200 and was certified double platinum by the RIAA.[39][40]"Will 2K", the second single from the album, reached number 25 on theBillboardHot 100.[41]Before the end of 1999, a video album was released featuring Smith's seven music videos released to date,[44]which reached number 25 on theUK Music Video Chart.[45]The same year, he was also featured onThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Airco-starTatyana Ali's single "Boy You Knock Me Out", which reached number three on theUK Singles Chartand topped theUK R&B Singles Chart.[38][46]Smith portrayed heavyweight boxerMuhammad Aliin the 2001 biopicAli.

Smith left an imprint of his hands and feet outside the theater in front of many fans.[53]Later that month, Smith starred in the filmI Am Legend, released on December 14, 2007. Alongside marginally positive reviews,[54]its opening was the largest ever for a film released in the United States during December. Smith himself has said that he considers the film to be "aggressively unique".[55]A reviewer said that the film's commercial success "cemented [Smith's] standing as the number one box office draw in Hollywood."[56]On December 1, 2008,TV Guidereported that Smith was selected as one of America's top ten most fascinating people of 2008 for aBarbara WaltersABCspecial that aired on December 4, 2008.[57]2008–2019: Blockbusters and critical disappointmentsIn 2008, Smith was reported to be developing a film entitledThe Last Pharaoh, in which he would be starring asTaharqa.[58]Smith later starred in the superhero movieHancock,[59]which grossed $227,946,274 in the United States and Canada and had a worldwide total of $624,386,746.[60]On August 19, 2011, it was announced that Smith returned to the studio with producer La Mar Edwards to work on his fifth studio album.[61]Smith again reprised his role as Agent J withMen in Black 3, which opened on May 25, 2012, his first major starring role in four years.[62][63]After the release of the film, Smith was content with ending his work with the franchise, saying, "I think three is enough for me. Three of anything is enough for me. We'll look at it and we'll consider it, but it feels like that it might be time to let someone else do that."[64]Men in Black 3, released ten years afterMen in Black II(2002), grossed over $624 million worldwide.[65][66]Unadjusted for inflation, it is the highest-grossing film in the series.[67][68]In 2013, Smith starred inAfter Earthwith his son Jaden. The film was a disappointment at the domestic box office and was panned critically.[69]Calling the film "the most painful failure in my career", Smith ended up taking a year and a half break as a result.[70]Smith andSuicide Squadco-starMargot Robbiein 2016Smith starred oppositeMargot Robbiein the romance dramaFocus, released on February 27, 2015.[71]He played Nicky Spurgeon, a veteran con artist who takes a young, attractive woman under his wing. Smith was set to star in the sci-fi thrillerBrilliance, an adaptation ofMarcus Sakey's novel of the same name scripted byJurassic ParkwriterDavid Koepp, but he left the project to work on theRidley Scott-produced sports dramaConcussion.[72][73]InConcussion, Smith played Dr.Bennet Omaluof theBrain Injury Research Institute, the first to discoverchronic traumatic encephalopathy. Smith reported he had doubts about the film early in the production, saying, "some of my happiest memories are of watching my son catch and throw a football. I didn't want to be the guy who did a movie saying football could be dangerous." These views subsided when he met Omalu, whose words about American ideals resonated with Smith.[74]Smith's performance was praised for being "sensitive [and] understated".[75]In 2016, Smith playedDeadshotin the supervillain team-up action filmSuicide Squad.[76]Smith's participation in the film meant choosing it over a role inIndependence Day: Resurgence, which he said would be like "clinging and clawing backwards."[77]WhileSuicide Squadwas a massive financial success, earning over $700 million at the box office, the film received negative reviews from critics. Christopher Orr, film critic fromThe Atlanticdescribed the film writing "The latest offering from the DC Comics superhero universe may be the most disastrous yet".[78]Later that year, Smith starred in directorDavid Frankel's dramaCollateral Beauty, playing a New York advertising executive who succumbs to a deep depression after a personal tragedy.[79]Weeks after signing Smith onto the film, his father was diagnosed with cancer, from which he died in 2016.[80]As part of his role required him to read about religion and the afterlife, he was brought closer to the elder Smith, calling the experience "a beautiful way to prepare for a movie and an even more majestic way to say goodbye to my father."[81]The film marked the lowest box office opening of Will Smith's career.[82]The film also received near universal negative acclaim from film critics.[83]Hollywood Reportercritic David Rooney criticized Smith's performance writing as "the least interesting component in a madly overqualified cast".[84]His filmBrightwas distributed via Netflix on December 22, 2017. An urban fantasy, it was the most expensive film for Netflix to date. Smith collaborated with his director fromSuicide Squad,David Ayer.[85]That month, Smith launched his own YouTube channel, which as of July 2019[update]has over 6 million subscribers and 294 million total views.[86]Also in 2017, Smith released the song "Get Lit" a collaboration between him and his former group mate Jazzy Jeff.[87][88]This would also be another critical disappointment for Smith, with critics panning the movie.Richard RoeperofThe Chicago Sun-Timescriticized the film and Smith's performance writing, "By the time Will Smith barks [the line, "Dude, you can't go through elf town!"] with 100 percent urgency and sincerity in the mindboggling mess that is "Bright," it's clear we are watching a truly terrible, mountainous pile of genre-blending garbage."[89]Smith performed the soccer2018 World Cup's official song "Live It Up"Smith performed the official song "Live It Up" alongside American singerNicky Jamand Kosovar singerEra Istrefiat the closing ceremony of the2018 FIFA World Cupin Moscow, Russia.[90]That September, Smith appeared, alongsideBad Bunny, on theMarc Anthonysong "Está Rico".[91]Smith portrayedThe Genie(originally voiced byRobin Williams) in thelive-action adaptationof Disney'sAladdin, directed byGuy Ritchie.

At least, that's been the excuse, although judging by the finished product, it was the script that never lived up to the promise of its premise."[97]Later that year, Smith had his second starring role in an animated film, inSpies in Disguise, oppositeTom Holland. Smith voiced Lance Sterling, a spy who teams up with the nerdy inventor who creates his gadgets (Holland).[98]In 2020, he reteamed with Martin Lawrence for the third film in their franchise,Bad Boys for Life.
