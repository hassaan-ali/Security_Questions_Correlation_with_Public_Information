Ever wonder how she fuels those powerful serves? So did we, which is why we went right to the source, to ask one of the two most famous sisters in tennis about how she eats, how she cooks, and what victory truly tastes like.Is there a Williams-family signature dish?Serena Williams: That's easy: My mom's chicken, with rice and gravy. It was my favorite dish as a kid, and it still is now. That's my favorite meal from her or from anybody. I was just competing in Australia, and she was going to make it for me, but she forgot. Now she owes me! It's a family favorite. But there are more. Venus cooks a lot. My other two other sisters cook. For years, I was always making gumbo for everyone. My other go-to dishes are something I call a "seven-bean delight," which really only has five beans, but don't tell. Everyone loves my roasted chicken with garlic; for a minute, it was my turkey tacos. Now it's vegan sushi. I just love to cook!Can you recite one of those recipes by heart?SW: The easiest is my roasted chicken recipe. I make it French style. I put whole cloves of garlic all over the dish. Some under the skin, some inside the chicken, some inside the pan. I put butter on top of the bird, and butter inside the gut. It's not a light dish! I add only a little salt and pepper, not too much. Then I throw small baby onions everywhere, drizzle olive oil on top and roast away.Is there a cookbook you're obsessed with?SW: My go-to cookbook is called Eat Yourself Sexy! I've been eating a lot healthier for my sister [Ed note: This is because of Venus's Sjogren Syndrome] so the cookbook has all these raw meals, green juices, and smoothies. For me, "green" used to mean "yuck." But I've incorporated a lot of raw things in my diet this year. Venus calls us "chegan"—because we cheat with a little bit of fish and chicken.If you could eat a meal cooked by any chef in the world, who would it be?SW: My mom! I grew up watching my mom in the kitchen, that's how I know anything about cooking. I've always wanted to go to a culinary class actually. Besides my mom, I love Bobby Flay, Emeril, Morimoto—that guy is awesome.What are your favorite Wimbledon eats?SW: For Wimbledon, our chef, Lauren Von Der Pool, travels with us because I try to eat really healthy at that one. No roasted chicken on that trip for me. We have either her or my mom make our meals around match time. Unfortunately, there's no real "restaurant-hopping" when I'm away. Truthfully, I don't eat a lot before my matches. I can't eat because I get too nervous. I'll force myself to really carb up the night before, especially later on in the tournament, because I know I wont be able to eat in the morning. But carbing-up doesn't mean pasta—I'm more into brown rice or sprouted quinoa.What do you eat once you win?SW: Celebration food is always my mom's chicken. I request it every time, along with her biscuits.Are you a sweet or savory person?SW: I'm the deadliest of both: savory and sweet. I love those molten lava cakes, the ones where you cut into it and the chocolate spills out. Even if it's terrible, I can't say no to those. The best ones are at Nobu because they serve it with green tea ice cream. Ridiculously delicious.If you could get an endorsement deal from any food, what would it be?SW: Oh my god, I don't know! Okay. I love moon pies. If "Moon Pie" sponsored me, I'd be bigger than any house on this planet! I love the originals: banana, chocolate, or vanilla. Now I really want a Moon Pie!Describe your last dinner party.SW: I cook for my family a lot, but I've only thrown one proper dinner party, and it was when I was in my gumbo stage. I made a fish-based gumbo because I don't eat red meat or pork. It was basically seared barramundi with mangoes over quinoa, and kale with a mustard sauce on the side.What's your ideal dinner party music?SW: Either soft '90s or jazz. John Coltrane, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and you can't play jazz without Miles Davis.If you could cook dinner for anyone, who would it be and what would you serve?SW: Arthur Ashe and Althea Gibson, because they were black and played tennis, and that wasn't popular in their time. Both are dead now, but I'd really love to have them over. I'd just make a quick salad so we could talk and talk.What does victory taste like?SW: Victory is very, very sweet. It tastes better than any dessert you've ever had.Do you drink?SW: I'm very much a glass-of-wine girl. I love Cabernets, and most French wines. But I'm not a wine snob—I'm cool with a $7 bottle of Riesling from the local Publix.Where is your dream eating trip?SW: I have to say: South Carolina. I love the Southern palate. Those southern meals, there's nothing like it. I'm always eating really healthy now, so I dream of those.What's always in your fridge?SW: My fridge is really just vegan: coconut water, Gatorade (my favorite!), cucumbers, mint, kale, vegetables, ginger, and wheat grass.What foods do you detest?SW: I hate avocados. The texture is so yucky in my mouth. I don't love tomatoes, but if they're diced up I can get them down. And while I really love Japanese food, I can't do those fish eggs that are really fat, big, and orange. I don't like those.How do you eat when flying?SW: These days, I bring a green drink for the plane and something like a wrap with sprouts and fake-tuna made of walnuts. It's actually really, really good!Do you have a food philosophy?SW: You put out what you put in. In other words, just because I get all this exercise, it doesn't mean I don't have to think about it.Explore Bon AppétitFamilyHealthyInterviewsRead Morecooking12 Ways to Add Garlic Scapes to Your Spring Cooking RoutineBy Emily SaladinorestaurantsThis Dish Is Really Hard to Find Outside of Cantonese Banquet Halls.
