She is best known for being both the mother and coach ofVenusandSerena Williams, who are both widely regarded among the best tennis players of all time.
She is the former wife ofRichard Williams, whom she divorced in 2002.Biography[edit]Nicknamed "Brandy", Price was born in Saginaw, Michigan in 1952.
Her father was an automotive worker from theMississippi Delta.
1]She graduated from Buena Vista High School in 1970 and fromWestern Michigan University.
1][2]She has three daughters from a previous marriage to Yusef Rasheed:Yetunde Price(1972–2003),[3]who was a former beauty salon owner and registered nurse; Lyndrea Price, a Web designer; and Isha Price, a lawyer.
After Rasheed's death, while working as a nurse, Oracene marriedRichard Williamsand had two more daughters,Venus WilliamsandSerena Williams.
Both Venus and Serena are high-ranked professional tennis players who have won numerousGrand Slamtournaments.
She helped her husband as he began coaching Venus and Serena in tennis.
The Williams family moved toFloridaon the offer ofRick Maccito coach their daughters for free.
4][5]By the end of 2000, Price was no longer living with her husband Richard Williams, and citing irreconcilable differences, they divorced in 2002.
She reverted to her maiden name of Price.
6][7]During a semifinal match between Serena  andJustine Heninat the2003 French Open, Williams was booed by fans after a complaint about a line call.
Price believes that the boos were motivated by race, saying "We, as black people, live with this all the time.
It's all about control.
8]Tennis journalist and authorL.
Jon Wertheimhas said of Price, "You have to respect anyone incapable of gloss or spin (i.e., unwilling to lie).
9]Price describes herself as a deeply spiritual woman.
10]Price also has described herself as being a "rampantfeminist" when dealing with the overly sexualized images of women in the media.
11]She traveled to Kenya with her daughter Serena for charity work, as well as Senegal to aid in the construction of schools.
10]Price was portrayed byAunjanue Ellisin the 2021 biopicKing Richard.
Ellis was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actressfor her performance while the film itself was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Picture.Coaching[edit]Price's coaching has arguably been overshadowed by her role as mother, but as a coach she has been called underappreciated.
12]Price is not a coach in a traditional sense (though she did learn tennis herself to help teach her daughters the technical aspects of the game) and is instead credited, along with Richard  for helping to build a solid foundation of self-esteem and outside interests for her daughters.
13]Venus and Serena's "poise under pressure"[14]is often credited to the self-belief instilled in them by their mother.
There's no such thing as pressure," says Price.
As black Americans, that's all we've ever had.
It's life.
So where's the pressure?
15]This approach was coupled with, according to noted tennis coachNick Bollettieri, a respect that meant that neither Price nor Richard Williams raised their voices to their daughters.
16]Journalist Bonnie D. Ford has said that the longevity exhibited by the Williams sisters is directly attributable to their parents and the way that Richard Williams and Price have helped them manage their careers and lives.
Ford believes it is especially admirable that Price and her former husband have continued to remain jointly supportive despite their separation.

The family included her parents—Oracene Price, a nurse, and Richard Williams, who founded a security service—andVenus Williams, her older sister.
Price also had three daughters from a previous marriage.
While both parents encouraged Serena and Venus Williams to play tennis, it was Richard Williams who largely taught them the sport, taking the two girls to the public courts in the area.
He was known as a strict coach, and the sisters spent long hours practicing.
In 1991 the family moved to Florida so that Serena and Venus Williams couldattenda tennis academy.
Serena Williams turned professional in 1995, one year after her older sister.
Possessing powerful serves and ground strokes and superb athleticism, they soon attracted much attention.

Williams broke Graf’s record at the 2017 Australian Open, where she defeated her sister in the final.Serena Williams and her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr.In April 2017, Williams announced that she was pregnant (she had gotten engaged to Alexis Ohanian, cofounder of the website Reddit, in December 2016) and would miss the remainder of the 2017 season.
In September she gave birth to a daughter, and two months later she married Ohanian.
Williams returned to tennis in March 2018.
She failed to win a tournament that year, though she reached the finals at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.
The latter loss proved controversial as Williams was penalized a game after arguing with the chair umpire over a code violation.
In 2019 she was again defeated in the finals at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.
At the 2020 ASB Classic in Auckland,New Zealand, Williams won her first singles event in some three years.Williams reached the semifinals of the 2021 Australian Open but lost toNaomi Osaka.
Later that year she was forced towithdrawfrom both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open because of injuries.
After missing the first half of the 2022 season, Williams competed at Wimbledon but was defeated in the first round.
She later wasinterviewed forVoguemagazineand revealed that she would be retiring after the upcoming U.S. Open.
Williams stated that she was “evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.”Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.Subscribe NowWilliams’s activities outside of tennis include ventures relating to fashion, beauty, and accessories.

With 23 Grand Slam titles, Williams rose from the public courts of Compton, California to shatter records and dominate the field.Serena Jameka Williams was born to parents Richard Williams and Oracene Price on September 26, 1981 in Saginaw, Michigan.
Williams is the youngest of Price's five daughters, who include fellow tennis superstar Venus Williams.
Richard Williams, a former sharecropper from Louisiana, was determined that daughters Serena and Venus would succeed in life.
Seeing opportunity in tennis, he and Oracene taught themselves the game from books and videos so that they could coach their children.
Richard moved the family to Compton, California, where Williams began intensive tennis training with her father and older sister around the age of three.
The Williams sisters practiced for hours every day on rundown public tennis courts.Williams joined the junior United States Tennis Association tour and by 1991 she ranked first in the 10-and-under division.
Richard then moved the family to Palm Beach, Florida, where the sisters trained with coach Rick Macci.
Richard kept Williams and her sister from competing in the junior tournaments, hoping to ensure that they would not burn out before turning professional.In 1995, at the age of 14, Williams made her professional debut at a qualifying event in Quebec City.
Fellow American Annie Miller defeated her soundly.
Williams did not play another professional match until 1997, but by the end of that year she rose to number 99 in the world rankings.
In 1998, Williams’s ranking rose to number 20 and she surpassed Monica Seles to become the fastest player to record five victories against Top 10 players.Williams graduated from Driftwood Academy in 1999 and soon after signed a $12 million endorsement deal with Puma.
She won her first Grand Slam title that year, when she defeated Martina Hingis 6-3, 7–6 to win the U.S. Open, and rose to number four in the world rankings.
Two years later, Williams lost to her sister in the U.S. Open final – it was the first time that sisters played against each other in a Grand Slam final since 1884.The African-American Williams and her sister made an immediate impact in the predominately white tennis world: their strength and athleticism on the court overmatched many opponents and their colorful, fashionable styles garnered media attention.
The Williams sisters are credited with ushering in the power era of women’s tennis, characterized by blindingly-fast serves and commanding groundstrokes.
They competed together as doubles partners, eventually winning 14 Grand Slam doubles titles.
They took gold at the 2000, 2008, and 2012 Olympics and are the winningest doubles tennis team in Olympic history.In 2001, Williams won California’s Indian Wells tournament for the second time.
Williams, along with her father and sister who were watching in the stands, claimed spectators hurled racial slurs their way while booing them.
Williams later described the racist treatment as traumatizing and she boycotted the tournament until 2015.Williams continued to amass victories and rise in the rankings.
In 2002, she won her second, third, and fourth Grand Slam titles at Roland-Garros (the French Open), Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open, respectively.
In each of those tournaments, she defeated her sister Venus in the final match.
On July 8, 2002 she reached the ranking of number one in the world, a position she held for 57 straight weeks.
In 2003, Williams won her first Australian Open, becoming one of only six women in the Open Era (post-1968) to complete a career Grand Slam (in which a player wins all four major championships).
Williams actually held all four titles at once, an accomplishment she dubbed “The Serena Slam.”However, 2003 also brought troubles for Williams.
She underwent knee surgery in August and in September her older sister, Yetunde Price, was murdered in Los Angeles.
The loss of her sister was difficult for Williams.
She came back from the knee injury in the 2004 season, but other injuries plagued her for the next three years.
She won the Australian Open in 2005 and 2007, but her injuries and losses resulted in her ranking dropping to number 139.In 2008, Williams began her return to championship form by winning the U.S. Open.
The following year, she won the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and reclaimed her number one world ranking.
Her five-year gap between number one rankings is the longest of any player ever.
Williams cited her faith as a Jehovah’s Witness as well as an inspirational trip to West Africa for restoring her competitive spirit.
In 2009, she faced fines and probation after an altercation with a referee at the U.S. Open, but the following year Williams added two more Grand Slam titles and finished the season ranked number four.Williams suffered from a blood clot in her lung in 2011, but returned to dominance later that year.
In 2012, Williams earned a gold medal for singles’ tennis at the London Olympic Games.
The 2013-2015 seasons marked her third, fourth, and fifth number-one seasons, after which she had won her 21stGrand Slam championship and completed her second Serena Slam.In 2017, Williams won the Australian Open.
It was her 23rdGrand Slam title, meaning she surpassed Steffi Graf’s record for Grand Slam singles’ titles in the Open Era.
A few months later, she revealed she was expecting her first child and had been pregnant when she won the Australian Open.
That September, Williams gave birth to her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr., and married Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian shortly after.
Williams experienced a difficult childbirth: she had an emergency cesarean section and suffered from another blood clot and other severe complications.
By telling her story publicly, Williams contributed to a growing national dialogue about the disproportionately high number of Black women that suffer from pregnancy and postpartum complications.Williams returned to tennis in 2018, ranked number 549.
The attention Williams brought to the issue of rankings after giving birth led the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) to take action.
The WTA’s new rule allowed players who leave the sport for childbirth or injury to use their previous rankings to enter up to 12 tournaments within three years of their return.
Williams, whose career winnings exceed $90 million, also advocates for female tennis players regarding equitable prize money.Outside of tennis, Williams has been busy as well.
She realized her fashion design dreams when she released her clothing line (“S by Serena”) in 2018 as well as a jewelry line in 2019.
She serves as a UNICEF International Goodwill Ambassador; has opened two secondary schools in Kenya; and sits on the board of the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative.
She has her own venture capital firm, Serena Ventures, that invests in technology companies owned or led by women and African Americans.Williams was named the AP Female Athlete of the Decade for her dominance in the 2010s.
She continues to inspire tennis hopefuls and the wider public through her hard work and pursuit of excellence on and off the court.Works CitedAllen, JA.

When Williams told Olympia, who turns 5 on Sept. 1, that she was soon to be done with the life that made her an inspiration to millions, Olympia’s reply was as joyful as her mother’s celebrations after so many Grand Slam wins: a fist-pumping “Yes!”“That kind of makes me sad,” says Williams, leaning forward in her chair in the library of a New York City hotel.
And brings anxiety to my heart.” No kid understands their parent’s absence.
But Williams has spent the last few years of her incomparable career tormented by what she’s been sacrificing in order to keep going.
It’s hard to completely commit,” says Williams, “when your flesh and blood is saying, Aw.”Photograph by Paola Kudacki for TIMEBuy a print of “The Greatest” cover hereOlympia would also like to be a big sister.
One day in August, she blew on a dandelion, wishing for a baby sister.
This is what I have to deal with, on a daily,” Williams says, with the commiseration familiar to all parents of young kids.
And yet choosing this path requires a calculus that superstar fathers don’t have to make.
Tom Brady, father of three, can retire and unretire at 44; LeBron James, father of three, can sign a two-year, $97.1 million contract extension at 37.
It comes to a point where women sometimes have to make different choices than men, if they want to raise a family,” says Williams, who turns 41 in late September.
It’s just black and white.
You make a choice or you don’t.”Biology may have forced her hand, but Williams insists she’s at peace with her decision.
There is no anger,” she says.
I’m ready for the transition.” She’s thought about what’s next, without knowing how it will feel.
Williams will re-direct her curiosity and drive into her investment firm, Serena Ventures.
She’ll kindle her spiritual life.
She’ll evolve as a mom.
I think I’m good at it,” she says of parenthood.
But I want to explore if I can be great at it.”Greatness is something she knows well.
No tennis player, male or female, has won more major championships in the Open Era—the period starting in 1968 when the Grand Slam tournaments allowed professionals—than Serena Williams.
Australia’s Margaret Court owns the all-time record, with 24 Grand Slams.)
Williams earned 10 of those 23 titles after the age of 30, a time when most players retire or plummet in the rankings.
But for all that Williams accomplished on the court, it’s what she has meant off the court that makes her the most consequential athlete of the 21st century, full stop.
She, along witholder sister Venus, took over a country-club sport with resistance to a pair of Black sisters from Compton, Calif., baked into its DNA.
She helped change behavioral expectations for female athletes, and by extension women in all workplaces, by exuding power and passion—and bringing her full self—to her hard-court office.
She rewrote the book on body image.
When pundits, racists, and no small number of idiots slurred her physical appearance or laughed her off as “masculine,” she doubled down on photo shoots and flexes.Lon TweetenHer very being sparked a multitude of crucial conversations.
In 2018, her run to the Wimbledon final—months after Olympia’s delivery led to a life-threatening pulmonary embolism and hematoma that required multiple surgeries—inspired millions of moms.
But that chatter shifted, in an instant.
On a September afternoon, a male umpire penalized Williams at a key moment in the U.S. Open final, for a verbal outburst.
She argued that men got away with much worse.Serena lost to Naomi Osaka, and the fallout prompted debates about decorum, fair play, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, letter of the law, spirit of the law, and unconscious biases.All from a Serena Williams tennis match.Osaka, who has since won three more Grand Slams, never would have picked up a tennis racket if it weren’t for Williams.
I remember as a kid watching in awe, and I was so happy to be seeing a strong Black woman on my screen,” she tells TIME.
Even though she is retiring, her legacy definitely lives on through Coco [Gauff], Sloane [Stephens], Madison [Keys], and other women of color at the top of their game.
Serena is unequivocally the best athlete ever.
Forget female athlete, I mean athlete.
No one else has changed her sport as much as she did and against all odds.”When informed of Osaka’s comment during our late-August conversation in New York, Williams demurs when the talk turns to being the GOAT.
That is, up to a point.“I don’t know any other person that has won a Grand Slam or a championship in the NBA or anything else nine weeks pregnant,” she says.
She laughs, a habit when she wants to make a serious point.
A two-week event.
That tournament, I relied on my brain.
An athlete isn’t just about what an animal you are physically, like a specimen.
It’s using everything.
Your mind, your body, everything.
And doing that for 20 years.
And doing it against people that come against you and play the best game of their life.
Every single time.“You can come to your own conclusion after that.”The Williams sisters’ backstory is filled with tales of their competitive exploits.
There was a rage, a burning desire that I’ve never seen in two little girls, ever,” says Rick Macci, one of Venus and Serena’s earliest coaches.
And I haven’t seen to this day.”Richard Williams’ geniuswas that while many tennis dads suffocate their children, he nurtured their talent while encouraging them to be kids.
On rainy days at Macci’s Florida training facility, they’d study in his office.
Richard kept them off the junior circuit, on the advice of absolutely no one.
After they faced Hall of Fame legends Billie Jean King and Rosie Casals in an exhibition doubles match, Macci heard both sisters complimenting their own performances.
He turned around.
Venus, 11, and Serena, 10, were talking to a doll.Richard Williams with daughters Serena, right, and Venus in 1991 in Compton, Calif.Paul Harris—Online USA/Getty ImagesChildlike curiosity intact, the sisters went on to learn multiple languages and diversify their interests.
Serena has dabbled in finance,fashion, acting, and film production; she’s on track to be the first female athlete to become a billionaire.
Early in her career, she faced criticism for moonlighting outside of tennis.
She was supposedly unfocused, distracted.
She again rewrote the rules.
Expanding her palette prevented the burnout that previously plagued so many players.
No woman has won more big matches in her later years.Williams conquered her first major, the 1999 U.S. Open, at 17.
It really was a different mentality of tennis,” saysChris Evert, the 18-time major champion.
Go for everything.
When you’re under pressure, you’re more aggressive.” Serena and Venus wore braids with beads in those early years on tour.
Even this seemingly small fashion choice carried meaning.
The tennis world was not accustomed to seeing Black girls show up adorned in styles reflecting their African American cultural heritage, as opposed to wearing styles that blended in,” says Tera Hunter, a professor of African American studies at Princeton University.Serena raises the 1999 U.S. Open championship trophy, her first major win.
She was 17Ron C. Angle—Getty ImagesAround this time, Williams met Kelly Rowland, of the pop supergroup Destiny’s Child, after a concert.
She invited Rowland to come to a match.
I’m going to be really good,” Serena vowed.
As soon as she said that, I was struck by her,” says Rowland.
She remembers sitting in Serena’s box during a match when she was down a set.
You feel an energy shift,” says Rowland.
Something’s about to happen.
It’s watching her get upset, like we do as people, and then understanding she had to calm herself down.
It was her having this controlled kind of space she had made for herself.
And then it was about her dominating.
And it was so unapologetic.
It wasn’t anything she had to say.
It was like, ‘I’m about to take back what’s mine.’ I needed that at that moment.
It fed me.”It wasn’t just women who were taking cues from the Williams sisters.
An aspiring young race-car driver named Lewis Hamilton tuned in to Venus’ and Serena’s matches from a public housing complex north of London.
They were the two most inspiring sports figures for me,” Hamilton tells TIME.
Especially growing up in my sport, where I’m the only person of color, seeing these two prominent figures, also the only people of color, really gave me a lot of confidence that I can do something similar.
It’s not impossible.” Hamilton, winner of seven Formula One titles—tied for the most in history—has also bonded with Serena.
She carries a small microphone in her handbag when they go out, for impromptu karaoke.Over a quarter-century on tour, Williams has had her share of downturns.
She suffered knee, ankle, shoulder, foot, hamstring, and Achilles injuries.
She grieved the death of older sister Yetunde Price, who was killed in a 2003 shooting, in a case of mistaken identity.
She was vilified at the 2009 U.S. Open for threatening a lineswoman after a foot-fault call.
Williams apologized.
And then she won two more Slams the next year.In February 2011, Williams was supposed to fly from Los Angeles to New York City, before going off to London for a fashion show.
She canceled plans at the last minute, choosing to hang out with Venus instead.
That night, she checked into a hospital with breathing difficulties:she suffered a pulmonary embolismand had blood clotting in her lungs.
If she had been stuck on a cross-country flight, Williams believes she more than likely would have died.
She thought she’d never play tennis again.
Ten more Grand Slams followed.When Williams found out she was pregnant right beforethe 2017 Australian Open, she played on with little hesitation.
Athletes understand their bodies a million times better than the rest of us,” says her husband Alexis Ohanian, the venture-capital investor who co-founded Reddit.
Even though the doctor was like, ‘You’ve got to take it easy, 100° heat, yadda, yadda, yadda,’ Serena said, ‘I got this.’ As long as she was confident, I was confident.” Serena told her husband that she didn’t drop a set the entire tournament because she knew it was best to get off the court quickly, for the baby’s sake.

The Olympic gold medalist discovered she was pregnant the next year, in 2018; she continued training and competing.
Like Williams, Felix had a life-threatening delivery of her daughter: after developing preeclampsia.
Felix watched as Williams grinded her way back, ascending to the Wimbledon and U.S. Open finals in the year after Olympia was born.
Felix charted a similar path.
At the Tokyo Olympics, at 35, Felix won bronze in the 400-m and a relay gold to become the most decorated female Olympic track-and-field athlete in history, and pass Carl Lewis for the most Olympic track-and-field medals won by an American.
I was heavily influenced by her experience and the comeback,” says Felix.
Here’s the ultimate example that it can be done.”As her career extended, Williams publicly embraced causes she had long valued privately.
In 2015,she again played at Indian Wells, the prominent Southern California tournament she had boycotted since 2001 after feeling an undercurrent of racist jeering.
Fans were angry that Venus pulled out of a semifinal against Serena with an injury; they were convinced that Richard had engineered that outcome.)
As part of her return, Williams helped raise money for the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit dedicated to racial justice and fighting mass incarceration.
Serena’s not just taking punches, she punches back,” says Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza.
She’s showing us that it’s important to belong to yourself.
And ultimately, that is a motto that I hold, and I know that’s one that she lives.”Rowland gets emotional when asked to try to describe her friend’s influence on the world.
For a young Black girl, to have survived the spaces where she wasn’t welcomed, she stood with pride,” says Rowland.
She represented for all of us, when we couldn’t do it.
She made it OK.
Claim your space.
Even when they’re calling you words you’d never answer to.
You can’t hear it.
Don’t hear it.
I’m sure that was a very scary place to be.
But to do it, and you’re the first to do it, the way you do it, with our own unique way, with style and with grace and unapologetic of your greatness,” Rowland says, choking back tears.
That took some … f-cking guts.”It’s been too long a road for Williams to shy away from what she’s done.
She owns it.
Deservedly.
Unapologetically.
And it’s rooted in what she knows she and her sister have meant to the sport that they both shaped and were shaped by.
We changed the game of tennis,” Williams says.
We changed how people play, period.
People never attacked.
People never took balls early.
People never served like this.
People never had to play so hard to beat two Black girls from Compton.”Off the court, she’s helped transform beauty standards—often in the face of crass scrutiny and racist tropes.
A lot of people feel they’re not pretty or they’re not cute enough because their skin is dark,” she says.
But she insists she never felt that way, despite all the shots directed her way.
I think people could feel my confidence, because I was always told, ‘You look great.
Be Black and be proud.’” There were too few prominent examples in mainstream sports before Venus and Serena—and few who won so regularly and defiantly.
Giving them that confidence, that motivation, is something that has literally never been done,” says Williams.
You don’t let the world decide beauty.
And me being thicker or whatever, I mean, curves are popular now.
Butts are popular.
I’m trying to lose mine, and people are trying to get mine.”Sharing a moment with daughter Olympia in 2020, after winning a tournament in AucklandHannah Peters—Getty ImagesKnowing insight delivered in a self-deprecating package is a Williams signature.
But press a little and she states plainly what she believes her legacy is.
Confidence and self-belief,” Williams says.
And teaching other Black kids, in particular Black girls, they can do it too.” She lists the current top Black players on the pro tour—like Osaka and Gauff and Stephens—who represent the emergent generation.
No one has ever been able to tell such an inspiring, authentic story,” she says.
You live through my mistakes.
You live through my ups, you live through my downs.
The surgeries, and the comebacks.
And it’s also a tale of never letting anyone write your story.
A lot of people can relate to that.
Always be authentically you.
Own who you are.
And love you.
It’s a big tale of self-love.”Read more:Serena Williams: 100 Women of the YearShe laughs.
In her final days as a pro tennis player, she also shed some tears.
She bawled while working onher Aug. 9Vogueessayannouncing her imminent farewell.
Walking away from the game you’ve spent your life mastering is complicated.
And it’s not to say she won’t decide to pick up a racket again one day.
But her next chapter isn’t about finding 5 o’clock somewhere.
Serena Ventures has invested in more than a dozen companies now worth more than $1 billion, including Master-Class, Impossible Foods, and Tonal.
Nearly 80% of the companies in the firm’s portfolio were founded by women or people of color.
It’s not that I’ve lost my passion for tennis,” Williams says.
I just get more love and more joy out of what I do in the VC space.”Paola Kudacki for TIMEBut expanding her family is paramount.
I can’t imagine my life without my sisters,” she says.
When I look at Olympia, I’m really not performing at my peak, by not trying harder to give her that sibling.
Coming from a big family, and coming from five, there’s nothing better.”As Williams prepped for the U.S. Open, she felt her game finally coming along after such a long layoff.
Before Wimbledon, where she lost in the first round, Williams hadn’t played in a year because of a hamstring injury.
The progress is bittersweet.
I can see my improvement, and I’m like, Dang, I’ll be good in January,” she says.
Once the Australian Open comes along, she might pine for another trip down under.
I’m already thinking that,” Williams says.
But would she go?
I’m not doing that,” she insists.So this is it.
One last dance in New York City.
One final message to millions.
Thank you so much,” she says.
I am so overwhelmed.
It’s just been an incredible, incredible ride, and I’m so happy that you guys are on it with me.” Williams stops, nods, brings her hands together, in the blessed position.

How Serena Williams Met Her Husband Alexis OhanianSkip navigation!DISCOVERWATCHSHOP+MOREUnited StatesSwitch ToUnited KingdomGermanyFranceAustraliaNow ReadingSerena Williams' Love Story Is Basically A Rom-ComStory fromCelebrity CouplesSerena Williams & Alexis Ohanian's Relationship History Is Basically A Rom-ComLia BeckSee All SlidesBegin SlideshowPhoto: Kevin Tachman/MG19/Getty Images.Some love stories start with the couple laying eyes on one another and knowing immediately that they're looking at the person they'll spend their life with.
And some love stories are more likeSerena Williams and Alexis Ohanian's.
While they're very much in love now, and are married and have a child, their first interaction involved Williams being annoyed that Ohanian was even sitting near her and making sure he knew just that.
But, you know, since they are who they are, this all happened at a fancy hotel in Rome.
The tennis great and Reddit co-founder might have gotten off to a start that wouldn't even have been a start for many people — I mean, she literally told him she and her friends didn't want him nearby... we'll get to that — but since then, they've had what seems to be a great relationship and have been very open about it.
And because of that openness,William and Ohanian's relationship timelineis pretty easy to track, from their meeting to their engagement to raising their daughter.They've shared their love story in interviews, on social media, andon actual billboards, so let's take a look at how this marriage — and a very cute little girl — came to be.Begin SlideshowHow Serena Williams Met Her Husband Alexis OhanianCelebrity Couples•Entertainment•News•Pop Culturewritten byLia BeckPhoto: Kevin Tachman/MG19/Getty Images.More from Pop CultureUnbotheredAngel Reese Is Still Facing Backlash For Winning & She Doesn’t Gi...Louisiana State University’s NCAA championship victory didn’t feel secure until Kateri Poole hit a dagger of a three-pointer with about a minute and 11byTamerra GriffinUnbotheredMo’Nique Fought Her Battle With Netflix For Black Women Eve...We should all have the self-assurance and conviction of Mo’Nique.

It came out so well and I have a feeling she's going to be hearing about it for years to come from folks.
Ohanian, who founded Reddit, also took to Twitter to share about the impact she's had on the world.
I've seen over the last 7 years how much y'all love my wife—what she means to so many, worldwide.
It's unlike anything I've ever seen," hetweeted.
Plenty of folks have told me 'how Reddit changed their life,' but the scale & impact of 'how Serena changed my life' stories absolutely dwarfs it.
He continued, "And that's just the stuff I hear when people come up to me to say hi.
You simply cannot overstate the size and influence she's had on so many people.
And for what it's worth, as far as I can tell, she has no idea.
She doesn't think about it.
Here's everything you need to know about Alexis Ohanian—husband to Serena Williams, tech entrepreneur, and investor.He was born in Brooklyn, New York to immigrant parents.Neville Elder//Getty ImagesOhanian was born in 1983 to a German mother and a father who is the son of Armenian refugees; his paternal grandparents fled the Arrmenian genocide.
I have a bit of a crush on the Statue of Liberty...
I look at that every day and keep in perspective—coming from a family of immigrants—everything they went through to give me the good fortune I’ve had," hesaid.His parents soon moved to the suburbs of Washington, D.C., where he graduated from Howard High School in 2001.
I went to high school in Ellicott City, Maryland, and I felt pretty ambivalent about the whole thing.
It just took time away from my doing things on the Internet...
In school, I was just a kid.
Online, I had authority.
My parents were cool with it, although I guess they didn't know I was e-mailing total strangers," he recalled ina 2012 profile.He then went to the University of Virginia; he graduated in 2005 with degrees in history and commerce.
At UVA,  he met Steve Huffman on the first day of freshman year and they bonded over a shared love of video games.In 2005, Ohanian and Huffman co-founded Reddit, "the front page of the internet.
Jerod Harris//Getty ImagesThey built Reddit in three weeks, and sixteen months later, they sold it to Condé Nast.
He left Reddit in 2010, three years after they were acquired.
I want to stay hungry.
I really believe my resources are best used to help projects that make the world suck less," Ohaniansaid.After leaving Reddit, Ohanian focused on early-stage tech investing, supporting start ups.
He also wrote a book,Without Their Permission: How the 21st Century Will Be Made, Not Managed.He met Serena Williams in 2015.ANGELA WEISS//Getty ImagesOhanian and Williams were staying at the same hotel,the Cavalieri, in Rome.
Williams was there for the Italian Open, and Ohanian was in town for the Festival of Media Global conference.
As Williams recalled toVanity Fair, "This big guy comes and he just plops down at the table next to us, and I’m like, 'Huh!
All these tables and he’s sitting here?
Williams and her party tried to get him to move to one of the other empty tables—and told him there was a rat by him.
Their first conversation went as follows:"No, we just don’t want you sitting there.
We’re going to use that table," Williams said.
I’m from Brooklyn.
I see rats all the time," Ohanian replied.
Oh, you’re not afraid of rats?""No.
Than, Williams invited Ohanian to sit with them, and the rest was history.
Williams invited Ohanian to meet her in Paris for the French Open, and they went on their first date.
At the end of 2016, Ohanian proposed at the same hotel where they met in Rome, and in 2017, they welcomed Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. in September and married in November in New Orleans.Tim Clayton - Corbis//Getty ImagesYou can always find Ohanian in Williams's player's box, cheering his wife on.
In 2021, he shared, "I'll be a self-made billionaire one day and most people will still know me as Serena's husband (or Olympia's dad) and that's fine by me."
In 2022, in response to Drake's diss track about him being a "groupie," Ohanianresponded, ""The reason I stay winning is because I'm relentless about being the absolute best at whatever I do—including being the best groupie for my wife & daughter.
When Williams announced her retirement, a large part of her decision came from wanting to expand their family.He's a big advocate for paternity leave.Hannah Peters//Getty ImagesHe started fighting for paid paternity leave after the birth of their daughter, when he took a full 16 weeks off.In 2019, he started advocating for federal paid family leave legislation.
I hope to be meeting with many senators, representatives, plenty of dads, on both sides of the aisle, in both houses of the Legislature, who want this to be the law of the land," Ohanian toldGood Morning America.
What we are looking for is some minimum number of weeks of leave.
In 2020, he opened up how Williams nearly dying in childbirth emphasized the need, to him, for paid paternal leave.
The understanding of my responsibility to care for my family that I gained during those first months after Olympia’s birth has never left me, and it gives purpose to my fatherhood today," hewrote in an OpEd in theNew York Times.He's a supportive husband during the 2022 U.S. Open.Ohanian has been front and center cheering on hiswife during her last tournament, and brought their daughter, Olympia, along to the first round:Olympia and Alexis Ohanian cheer Serena Williams during the first round of the 2022 U.S. Open.Tim Clayton - Corbis//Getty ImagesThey also attended her second round match together:Father and daughter on the third day of the U.S. Open.Jean Catuffe//Getty ImagesYou will surely find Ohanian front and center in Serena's box for her subsequent matches.Emily BurackEmily Burack(she/her) is the news writer for Town & Country, where she covers entertainment, culture, the royals, and a range of other subjects.

How does a self-described unequivocal nerd end up with one of the greatest athletes in recorded history?"
Colbert jokingly asked Ohanian.
How does that come about?
It's not a natural match.
I would beg to differ on one hand, because she's actually a total nerd," Ohanian said.He then revealed that the two met by chance.
Ohanian was at a conference in Rome while Williams was playing a tournament there.
Ohanian was drinking coffee outside at his hotel, and an Australian man — who turned out to be Williams' assistant — tried to get him to leave by telling him there was a rat by his table.
I told him: 'Thank you, but I'm from Brooklyn — I see rats all the time.
It's really not a big deal,'" Ohanian said.His indifference got the attention of Williams, who turned around and asked him if he really wasn't freaked out by rats.
They started talking, and she asked what he did for a living.
When he told her he helped create Reddit, she said she had never heard of the site.Before parting, they traded contact information, and Williams invited Ohanian to see her compete at the French Open.
Though she had offered the invitation half-heartedly, Ohanian said, he accepted without reservation and flew to Paris shortly afterward.He coyly told her that he was very busy but wanted to spend some time together.
The two eventually spent a day wandering Paris and visited a zoo.While there, they happened upon a leopard's enclosure at its feeding time.
They watched as the ravenous big cat feasted on a dead bunny that had been flung at it.
It was a show," Ohanian said.
I mean, this leopard just went in, and blood is going everywhere.
Williams was visibly disturbed by the scene, so Ohanian held and comforted her.
He said he sensed the connection right then and there.
In that moment, thanks to that poor, poor rabbit, I found love," Ohanian said.
In spite of everything else.

One thing that I'm still working on is balancing that with time off, with time away, with time to reset and recharge,” he said during an appearance onCBS This Morning.
Something she's really good at is shutting it off and focusing on family time or personal time.
I'm always a smart phone away from dipping back into a term sheet or dipping back into work.
I certainly still get checked from time to time on that one because it's something that I want to be my best.
I think we all do.

This makes her the number one ranked player in terms of prize money earnings in the sport.How Much Did Nike Pay Serena Williams?Williams' biggest endorsement was with Nike.
In 2003, she signed a deal worth an estimated $40 million, which would extend to $55 million if Williams hit "all of her performance incentives.
Serena Williams is more than a world-class tennis player -- she is a world-class athlete,'' Marketing Director of Nike, Riccardo Colombini, saidat the timeof the deal.
Working with Serena will give Nike valuable insights.
That deal was followed by her Puma contract which was worth an estimated $13 million that she signed for the first five years of her career.Williams also has made deals with other big-name companies like Wilson, Gatorade, Chase Bank, Pepsi, Beats by Dre, and multiple others.Who is Serena Williams' Husband, Alexis Ohanian?Serena Williams is married to Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian.

Williams has said that Serena Ventures is something she plans to turn her full attention to upon her retirement.The tennis star has invested millions in several start-up companies, such asSelena Gomez's Wondermindand supply chain operating system Calico.
The balance has been slowly shifting toward Serena Ventures.
I always say that I'm a sponge: At night I go to bed and I squeeze myself out so that the next day I can take up as much new information as I can," Williams penned in herVogueessay that detailed her retirement.
This year we raised $111 million of outside financing, from banks, private individuals, and family offices.
Seventy-eight percent of our portfolio happens to be companies started by women and people of color because that's who we are.

But she’s not ruling out a return to competitive tennis.“I am not retired,” Williams said.
The chances [of me returning] are very high.
You can come to my house and [see] I have a court.”The 41-year-old global superstar made her first public appearance since her memorable U.S. Open send-off at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco on Wednesday.
Williams came to promote her investment company,Serena Ventures, which raised $111 million in outside funding this year.“I started this company a while ago, so I just jumped right into that,” Williams told TechCrunch editor Jordan Crook in front of a packed audience.
I didn’t even think about the whole retirement.“I still haven’t really thought about it.
But I did go on the court the other day and [realized] for the first time in my life that I’m not playing for a competition and that felt very weird,” Williams continued.
It was like the first day of the rest of my life, and so far, I am enjoying it.
But I’m still trying to find that balance.”Founding & Managing Partner of Serena Ventures Alison Rapaport Stillman (left), Founding & Managing Partner of Serena Ventures Serena Williams (center), and TechCrunch Deputy Editor Jordan Crook (right) speak onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt 2022 on October 19, 2022 in San Francisco, Calif. | Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunchWilliam’s post-tennis life started long before she stopped playing.
Five years ago, she partnered with former J.P. Morgan portfolio manager Alison Rapaport Stillman to launch her venture capital firm, which she said is focused on investing in consumer-facing technology that serves women and people of color.According to Williams and her firm, 78% of Serena Venture’s portfolio is made up of companies started by those underrepresented groups, with companies that include Tonal, Impossible Foods, Noom and Esusu, to name a few.“It was supposed to be about creating opportunities for others,” Williams said.
But it ended up being sort of the opposite.“We’re looking for founders with a personal connection to the problem they are trying to solve,” Williams added.
I want to know that [the founder] is not doing this to fill in a space or take advantage of an opportunity, but because it is near and dear to them.”When asked about how she reconciles her fiery on-court persona with that of the investing world, where gratification isn’t always immediate, Williams said that the two are polar opposites.“The tennis [Serena] is very intense, but as I got older, the meaning of my name has enveloped me,” Williams said.
I am very calm and chill.“I waited 17 years to win my first Grand Slam,” she said jokingly.
So I can wait.”Should she not play competitively again, Williams is already one of the wealthiest athletes in the world.
She maintains a lucrative sponsorship deal with Nike that goes beyond her playing career and, recently, even netted her thebiggest buildingon the company’s campus.
She is also married to Alexis Ohanian, the cofounder of Reddit, and the two have a young daughter together.Williams’ discussion at the tech conference was precededby actor and comedian Kevin Hart,who was also promoting his own firm.

She says raising her daughter, Olympia, has never felt like a sacrifice the way tennis has.
These days, if I have to choose between building my tennis résumé and building my family, I choose the latter.”Across a decades-long career that began when she was 5 years old, Williams, who turns 41 next month, has amassed an unrivaled track record.
She won her first Grand Slam singles event at age 17 in 1999, and, with her sister Venus, has won 14 Grand Slam women’s doubles events.
In the 2012Olympics, Williams nabbed the singles tennis gold medal; she and Venus have three Olympic gold medals for doubles.
TheWomen’s Tennis Associationcurrently ranks her the No.
1 singles player in the world.In 2017, Williams wasthe only woman to make Forbes’s listof the world’s 100 highest-paid athletes, coming in at No.

On last year’s list, she jumped to 28th place.
With a$260 millionnet worth, and over $94.5 million awarded in prize money, she is the highest-earning female athlete of all time.From the court to the corner officeWhile Williams didn’t specify a hard end date for her tennis career, she suggestedin an Instagram postthat the U.S. Open, which kicks off in Queens, N.Y., later this month, could be her last tournament.
The countdown has begun,” she wrote.
I’m gonna relish these next few weeks.”She’s been slowly shifting her balance toward Serena Ventures, she wrote in herVoguearticle: “Every morning, I’m so excited to walk downstairs to my office and jump onto Zooms and start reviewing decks of companies we’re considering investing in.”Williams says she’s fallen in love with early stage pre-seed and seed funding since making her first investments nearly a decade ago.
She was among the first investors in online education subscription platform MasterClass—one of the 16 unicorns her firm has funded, alongside Impossible Foods, Tonal, and French NFT company Sorare.“Think of Sorare as a new revenue stream [for female athletes],” WilliamstoldFortunein a January interview.
It can have a major impact on women’s sports; collecting, trading, or supporting the teams and the favorite players really brings so much more than ever.
Being an adviser, I get to see lots of companies coming up…it’s exciting, and it’s going to be so impactful.”Largely, the companies Williams has supported share hallmarks with the career she’s leaving behind: health, wellness, and athletics.
The six-person team at Serena Ventures has raised $111 million of outside financing in 2022 so far.
The company has made55 investmentsto date.
Nearly 80% of its portfolio is female- and minority-founded companies, “because that’s who we are,” she wrote.She name-checked a handful of female inspirations, including Billie Jean King, formerMeta COO Sheryl Sandberg, and Clear Secure CEOCaryn Seidman-Becker, whom Williams credits with informing her that women receive only 2% of venture capital money.“I kind of understood then and there that someone who looks like me needs to start writing the big checks.
Sometimes like attracts like,” Williams wrote.
Men are writing those big checks to one another, and in order for us to change that, more people who look like me need to be in that position, giving money back to themselves.”Sign up for theFortune Featuresemail list so you don’t miss our biggest features, exclusive interviews, and investigations.Read MoreGreat ResignationCompensationReturn to WorkCareersLaborSuccess StoriesMost PopularFinanceA professional couple who make over $200,000 combined say it’s ‘hilarious’ to think they could afford a home in Los...April 10, 2023BYAlena BotrosLifestyleKanye West’s private school only fed sushi for lunch and banned chairs and utensils so students had to eat with their...April 7, 2023BYChris MorrisandPrarthana PrakashPersonal FinanceA FIRE movement pioneer who retired early with $3 million at age 34 says he must return to work to afford his kids’...April 9, 2023BYAlicia AdamczykRankings40 Under 40100 Best CompaniesFortune 500Global 500Most Powerful WomenWorld’s Greatest LeadersWorld’s Most Admired CompaniesSee All RankingsSectionsFinanceLeadershipSuccessTechAsiaEuropeEnvironmentFortune CryptoHealthWellRetailLifestylePoliticsNewslettersMagazineFeaturesCommentaryMPWConferencesPersonal FinanceRecommendsCustomer SupportFrequently Asked QuestionsCustomer Service PortalPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseSingle Issues for PurchaseInternational PrintCommercial ServicesFORTUNE Knowledge GroupFORTUNE Branded ContentFortune Data StoreFortune ConferencesAdvertisingAbout UsAbout UsEditorial CalendarWork at FortuneBehavioral Advertising NoticeTerms and ConditionsSite Map© 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited.

DolanForbes StaffI'm an editor overseeing Forbes' coverage of the world's wealthiest.FollowingAug 31, 2022,06:30am EDT|Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinForbesWilliams, who in 2019 was the first professional athlete to make Forbes’ list of America’s Richest Self-Made Women, has quietly built a venture capital presence.Only Serena Williams, the 23-time Grand Slam champion, could draw the mix of bold-faced names who showed up at the Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows to watch her performance at the U.S. Open on Monday night: Mike Tysonsitting next to Martina Navratilova.Bill Clinton.
Dr. Ruth.Tennis great Billie Jean Kingspoke in a tribute to Williamsafter the match (in which Williams defeated Danka Kovinic of Montenegro in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3), recalling how she first met Williams and her sister Venus in April 1988 at a tennis clinic for 1,200 kids, when Serena was six and Venus was seven–and how even then, Serena’s serve stood out.
I told her, ‘Don’t change a thing.’”In 2019, the year that Williams became the first athlete to appear on Forbes’ annual list ofAmerica’s Richest Self-Made Women, Forbes interviewed Williams about her plans as an investor and featured her in a cover story for the magazine.
She’d already bet on 34 startups, focusing on companies started by women and minorities.
In March this year, her venture capital firm, Serena Ventures, said it hadraised $111 millionfrom investors, with a portfolio of 60 companies,according to The New York Times, including MasterClass and healthy frozen meal service DailyHarvest.
Five months later, in a cover article in Vogue, Williams, 40, announcedshe would retire from tennisafter playing at the U.S. Open.
That same month Serena Ventures invested in mental health startup Wondermind, cofounded by singer and actress Selena Gomez, Mandy Teefey andnewsletter entrepreneur Daniella Pierson.
Williams appeared on Forbes’ 2022 list of America’s Richest Self-Made Women in June worthan estimated $260 million.In her tribute on Monday night, Billie Jean King called out Williams’ efforts to use her fame and her name to make change.
Thank you for your leadership and commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, especially for women and women of color,” King said, to cheers from the sold-out crowd.
Thank you for sharing your journey with every single one of us.
We love you.
God bless you.
And guess what?
You’re just beginning.”Here is Forbes’ June 3, 2019, cover story on Serena Williams, republished in full.By Kurt BadenhausenOn Serena Williams’ calendar—which is to calendars what Jackson Pollock paintings are to art—Saturdays are designated family time.
The Saturday I’m with her in Rome (she was in New York earlier in the week and will be in Paris the following one) carries extra significance.
Exactly four years ago, in exactly that Eternal City, she met her husband, Alexis Ohanian, cofounder of online community Reddit.The two celebrate, in part, with the kind of outing anyone who’s not the most famous woman athlete in the world takes for granted: a stroll in a hotel garden with their joint venture, 22-month-old Olympia, in tow.
It’s more romantic than it sounds: The Rome Cavalieri goes so far as to call its 15-acre garden a “private park,” littered with marble and bronze, lions and unicorns.The regal surroundings befit a historic figure of American sport, who has 23 Grand Slam titles and has blown away any number of barriers and stereotypes.
And the unicorns?
Between Reddit and his$500 million fund, Initialized Capital, Ohanian does his part.
But it turns out that Williams has quietly been playing that game, too.
She’s now the first athlete ever to hitForbes’annual list of the America’s Richest Self-Made Women, with an estimated fortune of $225 million, the vast majority of it having come via her brain and brand rather than her backhand.
And over the past five years, she’s been quietly dropping money into 34 startups.
In April, Williams formally announced that Serena Ventures is open for business, to fund others and launch companies herself.Athletes are richer than ever, thanks to the explosion in TV rights fees for live sporting events, which trickle down to players.
The50 highest-paid athletesin the world made $2.6 billion last year, versus $1 billion 15 years ago.
And Williams is hardly the first to put newfound disposable income to active work—in the NBA alone, LeBron James, Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant haveall launched media companies, and Durant, Andre Iguodala and Carmelo Anthony are active venture capital investors.
But she is one of the few specifically gearing investments around a single north star: herself.“I want to be a part of it,” she says, sitting at the hotel.
I want to be in the infrastructure.
I want to be the brand, instead of just being the face.” Given her longtime background in style and design, that means overweighting on fashion lines, jewelry and beauty products.
Yes, she’ll keep competing at tennis—her resilient comeback last year after giving birth burnished her as a cultural icon who transcends sports.
And sure, she’ll happily continue to rake in easy endorsement money from the likes of Nike and JPMorgan Chase—her $29 million total income over the past 12 months is the highest of her career.But like a ground stroke with torque, Williams bets she can eventually dwarf those figures by leveraging some of her own cash with her name and fame.Power Game: Williams invested in 34 startups over the past five years.
The value of her portfolio has doubled to more than $10 million.ADAM PRETTY/GETTY IMAGESThe story of how sisters Serena and Venus Williams reached the top of the tennis world is the stuff of Hollywood legend: A black father with limited tennis experience homeschools his two daughters and teaches them on the streets of Compton, California, to penetrate and then dominate a lily-white sport.
You’d see different people walking down the street with AK-47s and think, 'Time to get in the house,'” she remembers of those early years.
When you hear gunshots, you get low.”Their father’s insistence that his precocious daughters avoid the private tennis academy machine and well-oiled junior tournament circuit left a mark on the younger one, especially after she won her first Grand Slam title at age 17.
It really shaped me for the rest of my career both on and off the court in terms of taking a chance and how to be different and how to stand out,” Williams says of his strategy.
When everyone zigs, she zags.So atSerena Ventures, she focuses on companies founded by women and minorities.
Yes, there’s a social purpose to that decision.
But as with her tennis upbringing, she’s also finding opportunity by avoiding the herd.
Just2.3% of the total venture capitalinvested last year in the U.S. went to women-led startups—and even when including firms with both a male and female founder, you’re just at 10%.
The numbers are worse for black and Hispanic founders.
Yet some 60% of Williams’ investments so far have gone to companies led by women or people of color.
What better way to preach that message?” asks Williams.The only way to find enough of those companies right now is to nurture them early, something that Williams got hooked on after investing and losing (eventually) $250,000 in a startup in the years before Serena Ventures.
I learned you can’t overspend, but I also learned that I love seed investing,” she says.
Of the 34 companies she’s backed through Serena Ventures, more than three quarters are early-stage.“It’s fun to get in there.
I don’t gamble.
I don’t jump off buildings,” says Williams.
I’m the most non-taking-a-chance kind of a person, but I felt like seed was where we wanted to be.”Given the exponential riskiness involved in pre- and early-revenue companies, Williams has built a team of Silicon Valley mentors around her, much as Patrick Mouratoglou has guided Williams on the court and WME’s Jill Smoller has handled her endorsements—almost a quarter-billion worth—for nearly two decades.
There’s Chris Lyons, from Andreessen Horowitz, who is an informal advisor and friend.
She is more passionate than 99% of the people in this space,” says Lyons.
She’s reaching out to me regularly asking what we think of companies.”There’s Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, a longtime friend, with whom she serves on the board of SurveyMonkey.
I always ask her advice in a lot of different areas,” Williams says.
The tennis star is also on the board of the social shopping platform Poshmark.
But one mentor stands above the rest—the one she married.
I’ve been really leaning on Alexis,” she says.
Williams had never heard of Reddit when the pair met in 2015 and Ohanian knew little about tennis.
But they bonded over ambition.
She is determined to be great at everything she does,” says Ohanian, whoForbesestimates is worth $70 million on his own.His venture firm’s targets are traditionally more tech-focused—big scores include Instacart and Patreon.
But in living through Ohanian’s deals, Williams has learned.
Initialized and Serena Ventures have even co-invested on a few, including Gobble, which does weekly dinner-kit deliveries, and Wave, which offers no-fee transfers on money sent to Africa by phone.
I’d like to call us a more modern business family,” says Williams.The rate of Williams’ investments has ramped up in lockstep with the onboarding of a portfolio manager.
Alison Rapaport, 29, was fresh out of Harvard Business School with an M.B.A. after a five-year stint in JPMorgan’s asset-management group, when she got connected with Williams through Andreessen’s Lyons.
Williams told Rapaport to come to the interview with three investment ideas, along with the numbers and rationale behind them.
Rapaport did her homework on the investment ideas—and diligence on her potential new boss, who earlier in the week posted on Instagram how much she liked Taco Sunday.
Rapaport arrived at Williams’ home outside San Francisco for a Sunday meeting at noon armed with investment ideas and two bags of takeout, make-your-own tacos, and she handled Ohanian’s rapid-fire follow-up emails with aplomb.
I knew this was our girl,” Williams says.Serena Williams slides around the red clay of the Tennis Club Parioli in Rome a few days ahead of the Italian Open, practicing to an eclectic mix of musical genres whose only commonality is that they’re sung by powerful women, from Rihanna to Adele to Pink.
As word spreads around the club that the world’s most famous tennis player is hitting balls in their midst, a crowd predictably gathers, the youngest among them squealing, “Serena!”, the oldest snapping and sharing pictures.Williams is by far the most famous female athlete in the U.S.—and only Tom Brady and Tiger Woods finish a tick ahead among all athletes in terms of public awareness.
And that fame carries almost no brand downside—her appeal rates above average across all demographics, from Millennials to blue collar to high income, says Henry Schafer, who tracks Q Scores, which measure the likeability of a celebrity.After 20 years in the spotlight, Williams knows how to handle the star power.
At the end of the two-hour session, she gracefully obliges several with autographs and selfies.
But more important: She has figured out at Serena Ventures how to harness it.The past decade has given rise to the celebrity VC investor, spurred by the success of people like the actor Ashton Kutcher and the musician Nas, who both have their own funds.
The recent IPOs for Uber and Lyft included scores of musicians and Hollywood A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow, Jay-Z and Olivia Munn, who got in early and cashed in big.
Overall, Ohanian is skeptical of the trend.
The advice I generally give to founders is don’t take money from celebrities,” he says.
The only exception is when they are really going to add value.
Because in most cases, they are not really familiar with this world and if you are doing it to feed your ego, it’s a bad idea.”So Williams tries to put money in deals where her fame and brand and platform grow the pie.
As one of the better product endorsers of this century, it’s something she’s honed in ways that most musicians and actors (who turn up their noses at most product deals) have not.
She counts nearly 30 million followers across social media—her posts of herself wearing Nike’s swoosh generated more than $2 million in promotional value for the brand over the past 12 months, according to Hookit, which tracks celebrity influence on social media.
Serena is a once-in-a-generation voice, reaching a global audience that extends well beyond tennis,” says Hookit CEO Scott Tilton.And that voice is amplified exponentially when dealing with an early-stage brand, rather than one like Nike.
She shared a pair of videos in an Instagram story of her entourage eating Daily Harvest meals ahead of her hosting duties for the Met Gala.
She collaborated with Neighborhood Goods, which brings a pop-up approach to retailing, for her clothing line.
Using her platform to talk about our mission was the biggest support we’ve had besides her capital,” says Georgina Gooley, cofounder of Billie, which makes razors priced to eliminate the “pink tax” that makes female-targeted products cost more than similar versions for men.The dating and networking app Bumble added Williams as an endorser for 2019, including a Super Bowl ad.
The pair also partnered in a pitch competition in which two winners with female founders were chosen for funding from Serena and Bumble.
Three executives of companies in the Serena Ventures portfolio—Daily Harvest, the woman-centric co-working space The Wing, and Lola, a natural tampon brand—networked at the first-ever Bumble Fund Summit in April.
She is facilitating a place for people to connect with one another,” says Jordana Kier, Lola’s founder.That kind of investor-as-rainmaker power translates into another benefit: deal flow.
For more mature deals, traditional venture firms need to take large ownership stakes to hit return targets.
Williams, though, is happy to ride along.
Firms know Serena is a hugely valuable strategic investor,” says Ohanian.
I think it is the best of all opportunities, and she can essentially cherry-pick from the top VC firms on deals that are interesting that come her way and at the same time she still has her own deal flow from folks who want her to invest.”Change Agent: "A lot of people say what I do on the court is amazing, but I feel like that’s just the beginning," says Williams.
I want to be remembered for things I do off the court; lives I’ve been able to impact and voices that have been heard through mine.
LEVON BISS FOR FORBESAnother benefit of early-stage investing: Even with 34 checks written, she has still sunk only an estimated $6 million into these companies.
As venture investing goes, given her net worth, it’s still low-risk stuff.
And the returns so far seem promising; Serena Ventures says they currently value the portfolio at more than $10 million and double the initial investment.
Nearly half of the companies have had follow-up rounds of venture investment since Williams invested, and Serena Ventures even seems poised to score its first exit after Unilever announced plans to buy supplement firm Olly Nutrition in April.
Five of her investments are up at least fivefold.
Top performers include Billie, Daily Harvest, MasterClass and The Wing.But Serena Williams wouldn’t be one of the all-time great competitors without also needing to invest more in herself.
While she’s known as a fashion icon, she has cashed in only via others’ platforms, whether through endorsements or partnerships.
Now that’s changing.
Smoller, her longtime endorsement agent, recalls a recent meeting at Nike.
I was talking, and Serena interrupted me and started asking all these questions about their distribution channels, KPIs and growth strategies,” he says.
I looked around and saw their faces. . . . She’s at a level where she wants to understand the process and methods, which I think a lot of people don’t expect.” In May last year, Serena Ventures launched a self-funded, direct-to-consumer clothing line, S by Serena.
She kept waiting for someone to fund a company for her to design clothing, she says, but “I was thinking of this the wrong way.
I had to invest in myself.”The line includes dresses, jackets, tops, denim and more, mostly priced under $200.
She’s excited about an S by Serena show for New York Fashion Week in September.
The line got a boost in October when Williams’ close friend Meghan Markle was spotted wearing the collection’s “Boss” blazer, which quickly sold out on the website.
Williams returned the favor when she hosted a baby shower for the Duchess of Sussex in February.
Williams plans to launch an S by Serena jewelry line this year and one of beauty products in 2020.With all this commerce, Williams says she’ll continue to abbreviate her on-the-court schedule, prioritizing the Grand Slam events that burnish her brand.
While a dinosaur in the tennis world at 37, she still figures she has two or maybe even three years left.
I am in no rush to get out of this sport,” she says.
But in Serena Ventures, she’s laid the foundation to keep playing the game her entire life.
I want to create a brand that has longevity, kind of like my career,” she says.
It’s not fancy, it’s not here, it’s not out, it’s not trendy, it’s a staple, like my tennis game.”Photograph by Levon Biss for ForbesFollow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Send me a securetip.Kerry A. DolanEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

Williams cited the desire to give more attention to her investment firm, Serena Ventures, and to expand her family with her husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.
Their daughter, Olympia, was born on Sept. 1, 2017.Her retirement marks the end of one of the most remarkable careers in sports.
Her 23 Grand Slam singles titles are more than any other player—man or woman—during the Open Era.
She won an additional 14 doubles titles at major tournaments with her sister Venus.Williams’ success led to unprecedented earnings on and off the court.
Her $94.6 million in career prize money is more than double that of Venus, who ranks second with $42.3 million in career earnings.
Off the court, Serena has made more than $350 million in endorsements since turning pro in 1995.
Her $450 million in career earnings is top among all female athletes, with Maria Sharapova a distant second at an estimated $325 million.Nikehas been Williams’ most lucrative partner since she joined the Swoosh with an endorsement deal in 2003 after starting her career with Puma.
This past April, Nike opened the Serena Williams Building, which is the largest structure at the company’s headquarters at more than one million square feet.Williams currently has more than a dozen endorsement partners, including Gatorade, Subway, Wilson, Audemars Piguet and Beats.
Williams was No.
52 inSportico’s ranking this year of the world’shighest-paid athletes, with $35.3 million.
Her prize money for the 12 months ending in May was only $270,000, but she earned an estimated $35 million off the court, excluding investment earnings.
Naomi Osaka was the only other female athlete to crack the top 100.Serena Ventures, which was founded in 2014, has invested in more than 60 companies, such as Impossible Foods, MasterClass, Noom and Tonal.
Seventy-eight percent of the investments are in companies started by women or people of color.
The firm raised $111 million for its inaugural fund, announced this year.“I started investing nine years ago, and I really fell in love with early stage, whether it’s pre-seed funding, where you’re investing in just an idea, or seed, where the idea has already been turned into a product,” Williams wrote in herVoguestory.Yesterday in Toronto, Williams won her first singles match in over a year after being sidelined by a hamstring injury suffered during Wimbledon in 2021.
Williams, who will turn 41 in September, indicated at the end of the 3,000-word essay that she will play theU.S.
Open, which starts Monday, August 29.
I wasn’t ready to win Wimbledon this year.
And I don’t know if I will be ready to win New York,” Williams wrote, referring to her first-round Wimbledon loss to Harmony Tan of France.
But I’m going to try.

We’re in my car, and she’s holding my phone, using an interactive educational app she likes.
This robot voice asks her a question: What do you want to be when you grow up?
She doesn’t know I’m listening, but I can hear the answer she whispers into the phone.
She says, “I want to be a big sister.”STANDING TALLSergio Hudson dress.
Fernando Jorge earring.Fashion Editor: Gabriella Karefa-Johnson.Olympia says this a lot, even when she knows I’m listening.
Sometimes before bed, she prays to Jehovah to bring her a baby sister.
She doesn’t want anything to do with a boy!)
I’m the youngest of five sisters myself, and my sisters are my heroes, so this has felt like a moment I need to listen very carefully to.Believe me, I never wanted to have to choose between tennis and a family.
I don’t think it’s fair.
If I were a guy, I wouldn’t be writing this because I’d be out there playing and winning while my wife was doing the physical labor of expanding our family.
Maybe I’d be more of a Tom Brady if I had that opportunity.
Don’t get me wrong: I love being a woman, and I loved every second of being pregnant with Olympia.
I was one of those annoying women who adored being pregnant and was working until the day I had to report to the hospital—although things got super complicated on the other side.
And I almost did do the impossible: A lot of people don’t realize that I was two months pregnant when I won the Australian Open in 2017.
But I’m turning 41 this month, and something’s got to give.I’ve been reluctant to admit that I have to move on from playing tennis.
It’s like a taboo topic.
It comes up, and I start to cry.
I think the only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapistI have never liked the wordretirement.It doesn’t feel like a modern word to me.
I’ve been thinking of this as a transition, but I want to be sensitive about how I use that word, which means something very specific and important to a community of people.
Maybe the best word to describe what I’m up to isevolution.I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me.
A few years ago I quietly started Serena Ventures, a venture capital firm.
Soon after that, I started a family.
I want to grow that family.But I’ve been reluctant to admit to myself or anyone else that I have to move on from playing tennis.
Alexis, my husband, and I have hardly talked about it; it’s like a taboo topic.
I can’t even have this conversation with my mom and dad.
It’s like it’s not real until you say it out loud.
It comes up, I get an uncomfortable lump in my throat, and I start to cry.
The only person I’ve really gone there with is my therapist!
One thing I’m not going to do is sugarcoat this.
I know that a lot of people are excited about and look forward to retiring, and I really wish I felt that way.
Ashleigh Barty was number one in the world when she left the sport this March, and I believe she really felt ready to move on.
Caroline Wozniacki, who is one of my best friends, felt a sense of relief when she retired in 2020.LIVING LEGENDSPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz with sister Venus Williams inVogue, May 1998.Praise to these people, but I’m going to be honest.
There is no happiness in this topic for me.
I know it’s not the usual thing to say, but I feel a great deal of pain.
It’s the hardest thing that I could ever imagine.
I hate it.
I hate that I have to be at this crossroads.
I keep saying to myself, I wish it could be easy for me, but it’s not.
I’m torn: I don’t want it to be over, but at the same time I’m ready for what’s next.
I don’t know how I’m going to be able to look at this magazine when it comes out, knowing that this is it, the end of a story that started in Compton, California, with a little Black girl who just wanted to play tennis.
This sport has given me so much.
I love to win.
I love the battle.
I love to entertain.
I’m not sure every player sees it that way, but I love the performance aspect of it—to be able to entertain people week after week.
Some of the happiest times in my life were spent waiting in that hallway in Melbourne, and walking out into Rod Laver Arena with my earphones in and trying to stay focused and drown out the noise but still feeling the energy of the crowd.
Night matches in Arthur Ashe Stadium at Flushing Meadows.
Hitting an ace on set point.My whole life, up to now, has been tennis.
My dad says I first picked up a racket when I was three, but I think it was even earlier.
There’s a picture of Venus pushing me in a stroller on a tennis court, and I couldn’t have been more than 18 months.
Unlike Venus, who’s always been stoic and classy, I’ve never been one to contain my emotions.
I remember learning to write my alphabet for kindergarten and not doing it perfectly and crying all night.
I was so angry about it.
I’d erase and rewrite thatAover and over, and my mother let me stay up all night while my sisters were in bed.
That’s always been me.
I want to be great.
I want to be perfect.
I know perfect doesn’t exist, but whatever my perfect was, I never wanted to stop until I got it right.To me that’s kind of the essence of being Serena: expecting the best from myself and proving people wrong.
There were so many matches I won because something made me angry or someone counted me out.
That drove me.
I’ve built a career on channeling anger and negativity and turning it into something good.
My sister Venus once said that when someone out there says you can’t do something, it is because they can’t do it.
But I did do it.
And so can you.POWER PLAYERPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz inVogue, April 2003.If you watchedKing Richard,then you know that when I was little, I was not very good at tennis.
I was so sad when I didn’t get all the early opportunities that Venus got, but that helped me.
It made me work harder, turning me into a savage fighter.
I’d travel to tournaments with Venus as her hitting partner, and if there was an open slot, I’d play.
I followed her around the world and watched her.
When she lost, I understood why, and I made sure I wouldn’t lose the same way.
That’s how I started to move so fast up the rankings, because I learned the lessons from Venus’s losses instead of the hard way, from my own.
It was as if I were playing her matches, too.
I’m a good mimic.
Growing up I tried to copy Pete Sampras.
I loved Monica Seles, and then I studied Monica Seles.
I watched, I listened, then I attacked.
But if I hadn’t been in Venus’s shadow, I would never be who I am.
When someone said I was just the little sister, that’s when I got really fired up.I started playing tennis with the goal of winning the U.S. Open.
I didn’t think past that.
And then I just kept winning.
I remember when I passed Martina Hingis’s grand slam count.
Then Seles’s.
And then I tied Billie Jean King, who is such an inspiration for me because of how she has pioneered gender equality in all sports.
Then it was climbing over the Chris Evert–Martina Navratilova mountain.
There are people who say I’m not the GOAT because I didn’t pass Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam titles, which she achieved before the “open era” that began in 1968.
I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want that record.
Obviously I do.
But day to day, I’m really not thinking about her.
If I’m in a grand slam final, then yes, I am thinking about that record.
Maybe I thought about it too much, and that didn’t help.
The way I see it, I should have had 30-plus grand slams.
I had my chances after coming back from giving birth.
I went from a C-section to a second pulmonary embolism to a grand slam final.
I played while breastfeeding.
I played through postpartum depression.
But I didn’t get there.
Shoulda, woulda, coulda.
I didn’t show up the way I should have or could have.
But I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine.
Actually it’s extraordinary.
But these days, if I have to choose between building my tennis résumé and building my family, I choose the latter.QUEEN OF THE COURTPhotographed by Annie Leibovitz inVogue, April 2015.Earlier in my career, I never thought about having kids.
There were times when I’ve wondered if I should ever bring kids into this world, with all its problems.
I was never that confident or comfortable around babies or children, and I figured that if I ever did have a baby, I would have people taking care of it 24/7.
I’m not going to lie—I definitely have a lot of support.
But I’m also an incredibly hands-on mother.
My husband will tell you I am too hands-on.
In five years, Olympia has only spent one 24-hour period away from me.
This past year, while I was recovering from a hamstring injury, I got to pick her up from school four or five days a week, and I always looked forward to seeing her face light up when she walked out of the building and saw me waiting there for her.
The fact is that nothing is a sacrifice for me when it comes to Olympia.
It all just makes sense.
I want to teach her how to tie her shoes, how to read, where babies come from, and about God.
Just like my mom taught me.
As she grows, it’s something different every month.
Lately she’s been into watching baking shows, which we do together.
Now we bake with Play-Doh, which is so much fun.
She loves this game called The Floor Is Lava, where you have to do whatever you can to avoid touching the ground.
I love setting up my gym for the game, arranging my step-up boxes and weight machines like an obstacle course.
Whatever she likes, I like.AT EASE“I want to be great.

Nothing is a sacrifice when it comes to Olympia.
It all just makes sense.” Danielle Frankel gown.I think tennis, by comparison, has always felt like a sacrifice—though it’s one I enjoyed making.
When you’re younger, you see kids having fun, and you want to do that stuff but you know you have to be on the court, hoping that one day it will all pay off.
I got pushed hard by my parents.
Nowadays so many parents say, “Let your kids do what they want!” Well, that’s not what got me where I am.
I didn’t rebel as a kid.
I worked hard, and I followed the rules.
I do want to push Olympia—not in tennis, but in whatever captures her interest.
But I don’t want to push too hard.
I’m still trying to figure out that balance.In my own life, the balance has been slowly shifting toward Serena Ventures.
I always say that I’m a sponge: At night I go to bed and I squeeze myself out so that the next day I can take up as much new information as I can.
Every morning, I’m so excited to walk downstairs to my office and jump onto Zooms and start reviewing decks of companies we’re considering investing in.
We’re a small but growing firm of six people scattered between Florida, where I mainly live, Texas, and California.
I started investing nine years ago, and I really fell in love with early stage, whether it’s pre-seed funding, where you’re investing in just an idea, or seed, where the idea has already been turned into a product.
I wrote one of the very first checks for MasterClass.
It’s one of 16 unicorns—companies valued at more than $1 billion—that Serena Ventures has funded, along with Tonal, Impossible Foods, Noom, and Esusu, to name a few.
This year we raised $111 million of outside financing, from banks, private individuals, and family offices.
Seventy-​eight percent of our portfolio happens to be companies started by women and people of color, because that’s who we are.
On the other hand, my husband is white, and it’s important to me to be inclusive of everyone.
Serena Ventures has been an all-female business until recently, when we brought in our first guy—a diversity hire!FEELING GRAND“I showed up 23 times, and that’s fine.

Dezso by Sara Beltran pendant.A few years ago, I was at a conference organized by JPMorgan Chase, where I watched a talk between Jamie Dimon and Caryn Seidman-Becker, the CEO of the security company Clear.
Caryn explained that less than 2 percent of all VC money went to women.
I figured that she misspoke.
I thought, There’s no way that 98 percent of that capital is going to men.
I approached her afterward, and she confirmed it.
I kind of understood then and there that someone who looks like me needs to start writing the big checks.
Sometimes like attracts like.
Men are writing those big checks to one another, and in order for us to change that, more people who look like me need to be in that position, giving money back to themselves.
I’m so grateful to women like Caryn, as well as Sheryl Sandberg and others who have mentored me.
It’s important to have women like that who believe in you and push you to think bigger and do bigger.I’d like to think that thanks to me, women athletes can be themselves.
They can play with aggression and pump their fists.
They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it allIn the last year, Alexis and I have been trying to have another child, and we recently got some information from my doctor that put my mind at ease and made me feel that whenever we’re ready, we can add to our family.
I definitely don’t want to be pregnant again as an athlete.
I need to be two feet into tennis or two feet out.This spring, I had the itch to get back on the court for the first time in seven months.
I was talking to Tiger Woods, who’s a friend, and I told him I needed his advice on my tennis career.
I said, “I don’t know what to do: I think I’m over it, but maybe I’m not over it.” He’s Tiger, and he was adamant that I be a beast the same way he is!
He said, “Serena, what if you just gave it two weeks?
You don’t have to commit to anything.
You just go out on the court every day for two weeks and give it your all and see what happens.” I said, “All right, I think I can do that.” And I didn’t do it.
But a month later, I gave it a try.
And it felt magical to pick up a racket again.
And I was good.
I was really good.
I went back and forth about whether to play Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open after that.
As I’ve said, this whole evolution thing has not been easy for me.I don’t particularly like to think about my legacy.
I get asked about it a lot, and I never know exactly what to say.
But I’d like to think that thanks to opportunities afforded to me, women athletes feel that they can be themselves on the court.
They can be strong yet beautiful.
They can wear what they want and say what they want and kick butt and be proud of it all.
I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my career.
Mistakes are learning experiences, and I embrace those moments.
I’m far from perfect, but I’ve also taken a lot of criticism, and I’d like to think that I went through some hard times as a professional tennis player so that the next generation could have it easier.
Over the years, I hope that people come to think of me as symbolizing something bigger than tennis.
I admire Billie Jean because she transcended her sport.
I’d like it to be: Serena is this and she’s thatandshe was a great tennis playerandshe won those slams.Unfortunately I wasn’t ready to win Wimbledon this year.
And I don’t know if I will be ready to win New York.
But I’m going to try.
And the lead-up tournaments will be fun.
I know there’s a fan fantasy that I might have tied Margaret that day in London, then maybe beat her record in New York, and then at the trophy ceremony say, “See ya!” I get that.
It’s a good fantasy.
But I’m not looking for some ceremonial, final on-court moment.
I’m terrible at goodbyes, the world’s worst.
But please know that I am more grateful for you than I can ever express in words.
You have carried me to so many wins and so many trophies.
I’m going to miss that version of me, that girl who played tennis.
And I’m going to miss you.HAPPY DAYSGucci Exquisite MTO gown.

21]Williams also won 14 major women's doubles titles, all with her sister Venus, and the pair was unbeaten in major doubles finals (the best unbeaten record in major finals in any discipline of the sport).
22][23]The pair achieved a non-calendar year Grand Slam between the2009 Wimbledon Championshipsand the2010 French Open, which granted the sisters thedoubles world No.
1 ranking.

26]She also won two major mixed doubles titles, both in 1998.
She is the only singles player, male or female, to complete three Career Golden Slams – one in women's singles and two in same-sex doubles.

40]Williams sisters at aPam Shriverevent in Baltimore, 1993When Williams was nine, she and her family moved from Compton toWest Palm Beach, Florida[36]so she could attend the tennis academy ofRick Macci, who provided her with additional coaching.
Macci did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls".
41]Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, as he wanted them to "go slowly" and focus on school work.
Experiences of racism also influenced this decision, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments.
42]At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on theUnited States Tennis Associationjunior tour and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida.
43]In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and took over all coaching at their home.
When asked in 2000 whether it would have been more beneficial for them to have followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit, Williams responded, "Everyone does different things.
I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us.
43]Professional career1995–1998: Professional debutWilliams' parents wanted their daughter to wait until she was 16 to participate in professional tournaments.
44]In 1995, just after turning 14, Williams planned to make her professional debut as awild-cardentry in theBank of the West ClassicinOakland, California, but was denied by the WTA owing to their age-eligibility restrictions.

305]Williams possesses an accurate and consistent ball toss, allowing her to serve to any position on the court with minimal differences in the position of the ball in the air; this makes it difficult for opponents to read her service motion and predict the position of her serve, allowing her to dominate a rally from the first stroke.

312]Williams tends to hit her backhand flatter than her forehand, allowing her to hit her backhand with speed, power, and depth both crosscourt and down the line.
Despite playing primarily from the baseline, Williams is an adept net player thanks to her extensive doubles experience, and will frequently choose to finish points at the net, either with deft touch, aggressive drive volleys, or a solid, powerful, and reliable overhead smash.
313]Williams possesses an aggressive return of serve – she neutralizes powerful first serves, and attacks weak second serves.
She is widely considered one of the greatest return players of all time.
314]Despite predominantly employing an aggressive game style, she is also an excellent defender, and is capable of counterpunching against aggressive opponents until she creates an opportunity to hit a winner.
She is an exceptional athlete, known for her movement, speed, court coverage, agility, flexibility, balance, and footwork.
Her on-court intelligence, shot selection, and point construction allow her to execute her gamestyle effectively.
315]She has been praised for her mental strength and competitive spirit, with her being described as one of the toughest opponents to beat on the court;Martina Navratilovadeclared her mental strength "unbelievable",[316]whilst tennis journalistJon Wertheimclaimed that Williams is the toughest player of all time.

Richard [Williams] may have something to say about this.

In the same match, new technology being tested made incorrect line calls late in the third set.
Williams argued with the chair over a couple of calls during the match, but was not successful.
Capriati won the match, with Serena herself acknowledging that this was primarily due to her 57 unforced errors; nevertheless, she accused Alves of temporary insanity[346]and said that she "felt cheated".
347]In a post-match interview Capriati sharply observed that bad calls had gone against her in the past as well.
Alves did not officiate for the remainder of the tournament; this was not punitive, as commonly thought, as she was not scheduled to officiate.
348]The controversy renewed calls for, and was widely given credit for, the adoption of technology such as theMacCAMandHawk-Eyesystems.
349]2009 US OpenIn theUS Opensemifinal round againstKim Clijsters, Williams slammed her racket on the court after losing the first set.

355]As the point was 30–40 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur.
Williams became angry with the chair umpire and made several gestures and unflattering comments toward her during the next changeover, including telling Asderaki that if the umpire ever saw Serena coming toward her, she should "look the other way".
356]Williams initially gained momentum in the set following the penalty, breaking back in the next game, but eventually flagged and lost the match, 2–6, 3–6.
At the end of the match, she declined to offer the customary handshake to Asderaki.
357][358]Williams mentioned the incident in her post-match speech as the tournament runner-up, asserting, "I hit a winner, but I guess it didn't count", but added, "It wouldn't have mattered in the end.
Sam played well.
359]A writer forESPNsuggested that Williams could avoid being found to have violated the terms of the "probation" on which she was placed following her 2009 outburst, as she did not appear to have usedprofanityin addressing Asderaki during the match.

Follow @alyroe on Twitter).Follow on TwitterFacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerPinterestEmailprintThis story was originally published on Sept. 8, 2016.Serena Williams has made history.
With a win over her older sister Venus in the final of the Australian Open on Jan. 28, Williams holds more Grand Slam titles than any player in the Open era.
To win a title, a player must win seven matches over two weeks on the sport's greatest stages and against its most dominant players.
Williams, 35, has done so 23 times in 66 Grand Slam appearances and has surpassed Steffi Graf's Open era record of 22.
Now that she has reached 23, the buzz turns to Margaret Court's all-era record of 24, and history beckons again.Such has been the career of Serena Williams, built of milestones upon milestones, as she became the first, the fastest, the winningest.
For more than two decades, she has captivated our attention and confounded our ability to easily package her enigmatic personality.
She is complicated and contradictory, fierce and shy, intense yet vulnerable.
Those who know her best say it's this internal turbulence that has driven her to rise from moments of despair and continue to chase excellence in a sport she has come to define, while pursuing happiness in a life that regularly tests her ability to overcome.As she continues her historic 2017 season, we offer an oral history, through more than 20 interviews with her friends, family, competitors and coaches, of the lessons, experiences, hardships and successes that have crafted Williams into the greatest competitor the sport of tennis has ever seen.PART ONE: THE PRODIGYPART TWO: THE BEGINNING OF THE WINNINGPART THREE: THE HARD YEARSPART FOUR: THE BREAKPART FIVE: THE ROAD TO 23Louisa BertmanPART ONE: THE PRODIGYSEPT.
26, 1981Serena Jameka Williams is born in Saginaw, Michigan, to Richard Williams and Oracene Price.
It's a Saturday.Oracene Price(mother): "What I remember about the day Serena was born is that she was a 10 ½-pound baby.
But she wasn't a hard delivery, my youngest daughter.
Isha Price(sister): "We didn't know if Serena was going to be a boy or a girl.
My sisters and I were at our grandmother's house.
We weren't allowed to go to the hospital, and I remember wishing and hoping we had a little brother.
I remember the phone call and our grandmother calling us into one room and saying 'You have another baby sister.'
I was a little disappointed.
The youngest of five girls, Serena embraces the role of little sis.
Growing up, she shares a bedroom and two sets of bunk beds with her siblings -- Lyndrea and Venus on the two lower bunks, and Isha and Yetunde on the upper bunks.
Each night, Serena crawls into bed with a different sister.
When it comes to her older sisters, Serena always gets her way.Isha: "We would have these family talent shows, and Serena always had to win.
She always sang the same song, 'Greatest Love of All' by Whitney Houston.
Even if she sounded like screeching tires, she won.
That's what we had to do or she would throw a tantrum and cry.
We didn't want to deal with the repercussions of her not winning.
Oracene: "With Serena, everything had to be perfect and she would get frustrated if it wasn't.
She always had to win, no matter if it was a talent show, cards, she had to be the winner.
She would sit on cards.
And they let her do it.
They gave it to her, even if she didn't win.
I think it affects her to this day, because she hates losing.
That's how come it was so inappropriate when they said we were setting matches.
Serena is not going to lose for no one.
In 1983, the family moves to Compton, California.
After learning that top female tennis players can earn thousands of dollars per tournament, Richard and Oracene begin teaching themselves the game in order to coach their daughters.
When Serena is 3 and Venus is 4, they pick up their first rackets, and their parents set to work.
Richard eventually leaves his job to coach the girls full time.
Serena is a quick study.
In 1991, she plays her first junior tournament at the age of 9 and makes it to the final, where she faces Venus.Serena Williams in 1992.Ken Levine/Getty ImagesIsha: "Venus was older and playing tournaments, and Serena wasn't playing tournaments yet.
Venus was enrolled in this particular tournament, and Serena wasn't.
Unbeknownst to my dad and mom, Serena sent in the application and signed herself up for the tournament.
Who does that?
You had to pay to sign up, and the tournament directors had to get the money from my parents.
She always wanted to be just like Venus; it was that little sister hero-worship thing.
Even then, she wanted to compete.
Venus Williams(older sister): "She got tired of watching me play.
She wanted to play.
Back then, I was bigger and stronger, and in the changeovers during the final, she'd say, 'Venus, let me win a game.'
I ignored her.
We were supposed to be professional.
I ended up winning the tournament, and afterward I said, 'Serena, I think we should switch trophies.
I like the silver one better anyway.'
She was the little sister, so she had no problem taking my trophy.
We still have them in our home in Florida.
1991Unlike most young players, Serena and Venus play few junior tournaments.
Richard chooses instead to hold his daughters out of competition until they are ready to compete on the pro tour.
In 1991, they meet with their first high-profile professional coach, Rick Macci, in Compton.
A few months later, the family moves to Florida so that Serena and Venus can train with him at Grenelefe Golf & Tennis Resort in Haines City.Rick Macci(Serena's coach from 1991 to 1995): "Normally if I see kids play, I see them at a national tournament.
I'm not going to somebody's house.
Richard said, 'The only thing I can guarantee you is you won't get shot.'
I had to meet this guy.
He's a comedian.
I flew to Los Angeles on a Friday night.
Richard, Oracene, Venus and Serena came to my hotel room in Compton, and we talked for three hours.
I will never forget Venus and Serena: One was sitting on each of Richard's legs looking at me while he grilled me: What do you have for breakfast?
Why aren't you married?
How many girlfriends?
Do you travel with kids?
What is your religion?
What time do you get up?
Are you colorblind?
Have you ever taught a black person?
When that ended, he said, 'We'll pick you up at 7 a.m. and go to East Hills Country Club.
They picked me up in a Volkswagen van.
It was shaking back and forth, three months' worth of McDonald's wrappers, clothes, Coke cans, bottles and a spring coming out of the seat.
We get to the courts, and it's not a country club.
It's a crummy park.
There are guys playing basketball, people passed out in the grass, broken glass all over the courts, people drinking beer.
Every person we passed called him King Richard.
We had to cross the basketball court to get to the tennis courts, and it parted like the Red Sea.Editor's PicksSerena, Naomi Osaka and the most controversial US Open final in history4yDon Van NattaGOAT debate over: Serena Williams and everyone else6yJohnette Howard20 stars serve up Serena praise8y2 Related"Usually after five minutes I can tell if there is something special.
We're hitting balls, and I'm going, 'These girls aren't that good.'
There were arms and hair and legs flying everywhere, beads flying out of their hair.
They were improvising, hitting off their back feet.
Then I said, 'Let's play some points.'
I swear to God, their stock went soaring through the hemisphere.
Their footwork got better, their prep got better, they cleaned up their act.
What blew me away was their burning desire to run and fight and get to every ball like their hair was on fire.
I had never seen two kids try so hard.
I had never seen bodies that could move like that.
Athletes with their body types went to other sports; they didn't play tennis.
Lyndrea Price(sister): "Their journey was my journey because I had to wake up too.
When Venus and Serena left, I left.
It was a family effort.
We didn't have a hopper, because those were expensive, so I would shuffle the balls with my racket and pick them up.
I wasn't playing, but I was out there every day.
Even as a kid, Serena was built.
She was so muscular.
She didn't have to do a lot of work to get that physique.
It was an anomaly that she was gifted at 3 years old to have that body.
I remember thinking, wait 'till they get a load of you.
Freddy Bryant(East Compton Park employee): "We always had to have the courts cleaned and hosed down because Richard stayed on us.
He would bring generators, tennis-serving machines, and the girls would work.
Mom would sit in the van and read books.
She was always reading.
When they finished, the girls would come inside and play pingpong and eat the summer lunch we served to the community.
One day stands out to me.
Serena was out by herself, going from baseline to baseline and Richard was like, 'You wanna quit?
You wanna quit?
Go sit in the van with your mom.'
Serena said, 'No.
No.'
She didn't give up, and every time she hit the ball, I heard that grunt.
She was 10 years old.
She was grunting and fighting.
I was like, 'Wow.
This little girl right here, she's a tiger.
Nick Bollettieri(legendary tennis coach, head of the IMG Academy): "I remember Richard Williams coming to my house in Longboat Key with his two daughters and saying they would be bigger than Michael Jordan.
They all thought Richard was crazy.
But he did something no one else did.
He kept them back from tournaments and taught them technique and to go for it.
Their daddy said, 'Run for every ball.'
And Serena would say, 'Daddy, the ball is out.'
And he'd say, 'No ball is out.
You have two sets of eyes: your eyes and your brain.
By the time your brain registers what your eyes think they see, it's too late.
But when you move, you get the ball.
Macci: "One day, Venus was out there grinding.
Serena wasn't working hard or moving her feet.
I said, 'Jameka [Serena's middle name], you have to start moving.'
What are you going to give me?'
she asked.
I'm tired.
I'm thirsty.
If you get me a Pepsi and some curly fries and a Snickers bar ... and on the corner, they're selling Green Day T-shirts.
If you get me that, I will work 100 percent for the next hour.'
This was her maturity.
I had an assistant get it all but the shirt, and this girl moved her feet on the court like Spider-Man.
For one hour, this girl was on fire.
When that hour was up, she said, 'I'm done and I expect that Green Day shirt here at 8 a.m.'"OCT. 28, 1995At age 13, Serena makes her pro debut in the qualifying draw at the Bell Challenge in Quebec, where she loses in less than an hour.
She doesn't play a tournament in 1996.

She said, 'Nick, I'm tired of coming in second place.
PART TWO: THE BEGINNING OF THE WINNINGSerena Williams and Max Mirnyi after winning Wimbledon mixed doubles in 1998.AP Photo/Dave CaulkinJULY 1998Serena and partner Max Mirnyi win mixed doubles at Wimbledon and again two months later at the US Open.Macci: "In practice, all Serena did was play guys.
She beat guys three to four years older than her.
It didn't matter who was on the other side of the net.
She didn't look at it like this girl is ranked this or that guy is 16.
At 11, she told me she thought she was better than John McEnroe.
She said, 'Did you ever see his strokes?
He has terrible strokes.
I can beat him for sure.'
It was silly, but she meant it from the heart.
And she believed it.
A great competitor is borderline cocky and courageous.
JULY 25, 1999Serena, ranked No.

Serena is a last-minute replacement by coach Billie Jean King when Seles pulls out with tendinitis in her right arm.
The Williams sisters account for all four wins in the U.S. team's 4-1 victory over Italy, sending them to the final.Mary Jo Fernandez(former professional tennis player, broadcaster, member of 1999 Fed Cup team): "She was young, a teenager, and that was my first glimpse of her inner strength and confidence.
She was for sure the leader.
And her sense of humor -- she's funny.
She makes fun of herself.
She carried this purse everywhere she went.
If someone's pantyhose ripped, she pulled out a pair of pantyhose.
It became a running joke during the tournament that whatever you needed, Serena had it in that bag."SEPT.
11, 1999At only 17, Serena wins her first Grand Slam title at the US Open, becoming the first African-American woman to win a major in the Open era.
She jumps to No.
4 in the world rankings.
It's a Saturday.Venus: "I was the older sister, and everyone thought I would win the first major, but she did.
I felt motivated.
Now I know what to do.
Serena showed me what to do.
That was crucial in my success in winning big events.
It was a turning point in my career.
At the time, I didn't think to say that to her, but over time, I've told her, 'If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have done anything.'
We have a good laugh about that."SEPT.
20, 1999Serena's win in Flushing Meadows lands her on the cover ofSports Illustrated.
Hollywood comes calling.
In December, she guest-stars on "Hollywood Squares," and then, along with Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras and Venus, Serena records an episode of "The Simpsons" titled "Tennis the Menace.
Bonnie Pietila(longtime producer and casting director for "The Simpsons"): "Venus and Serena recorded together, and they came to the Fox lot in a big SUV.
Serena brought her dog.
She was so good.
She has voice control.
And she can act.
There have only been two people who have come in and I've been blown away at how good they were, because they aren't actors: Serena and Peter Frampton.
When a nonactor comes in and can be that good, it's a wonderful surprise.
After Serena and Venus finished recording the episode, it came time for them to sign covers of copies of the script.
They each sat down in front of a pile of covers, and the two of them raced each other to see who could sign the fastest.
Serena won.

There had been sensational buildup, and CBS was up against a huge college football game.
Venus won and Serena was so angry about losing to her sister.
She had a look that was totally different from the look Venus had when she lost.
Venus always thought if she had to lose, it might as well be to a family member.
But Serena hated it more because it was her sister.
2003After withdrawing from the 2002 Australian Open with an ankle sprain, Serena goes on a tear.
She wins her first clay-court title at the Italian Open, the 2002 French Open, her first Wimbledon title and the US Open.
She returns to the Australian Open a year later and wins, completing the Serena Slam by holding all four major titles simultaneously but not in the same calendar year.
Incredibly, Serena faces Venus in all four finals matches.Shriver: "It is the most unlikely thing that has ever happened in our sport -- that siblings would face off against each other in the final of four straight majors; it is a once-in-a-galaxy type of thing.
Nowadays you don't get the same rematch in one major final.
That Serena won wasn't surprising.
She is an all-around better tennis player than Venus.
She has better technique, better grit and a more competitive, grinding spirit.
Richard forecasted that a long time before there was ever a Serena Slam.
It's hard to believe they grew up with the same coaching.
They're so different.
It's almost like Venus, being the older sister, was the guinea pig on certain shots, and they got the technique better with Serena.
PART THREE: THE HARD YEARSSEPT.
14, 2003Serena's oldest sister and assistant, Yetunde Price, is killed in Compton, caught in gang crossfire while in the car with her boyfriend, a gang member.
Serena is the first to learn of her sister's death and informs her mother and 'Tunde's children.Isha: "The thing I hated most about that situation was that Serena was the one who got the call.
They had attempted to call us all, but it was late and my phone was off.
We relied a lot on each other; it was us holding each other up at a really difficult time.
Unless you've experienced that kind of loss, you can't fully describe to somebody else what that feels like, like part of yourself is gone.
You have to almost re-learn how to live, how to approach every day.
Shriver: "That news hit her very heavily.
Her resilience throughout some major personal setbacks, her parents' divorce [in 2002], her sister's killing, her medical situations, she's had her share of heartbreak as far as relationships -- it's so impressive she's been able to stay on tennis track through such significant personal adversity.
JULY 3, 2004No.

15 Maria Sharapova in the Wimbledon final.Shriver: "Losing to Sharapova made Serena the champion she is today.
Losing to her in straight sets was a stinging loss that catapulted Serena, in the big picture, to greater heights.
That loss, followed by another to Sharapova at the year-end championships -- the last time Sharapova beat Serena --- was important for Serena.
She didn't want to lose in major finals.
Her record today in major finals is amazing, only six losses.

She begins searching for life outside of tennis, guest-starring on TV shows and attending movie premieres.
In the May 2006 issue ofTennismagazine, Chris Evert pens an open letter to Serena, imploring her to recommit to tennis.
Two months later, Serena dips to No.
140 in the rankings.Chris Evert(former world No.
1 professional tennis player, tennis broadcaster): "I always thought she could be the greatest of all time.
But when I wrote that letter, I didn't think she was taking it as seriously as she could.
She was losing to players she should have been beating, she wasn't in good shape, she was going to movie premieres, she was distracted.
I didn't want her to look back when she retired and think, 'All those years I squandered and I should have been in the best shape, I could have been more focused.'
I didn't want her to have regrets.
But what I didn't take into consideration was that she was going through a lot in her personal life too.

She came back a totally different person.
She fell in love with Africa.
That helped her to refocus on her life and her career.
Seeing where she came from, how we got to where we are now, seeing the ports where they shipped us off and the life of our people, that really changed her attitude about being a black woman.
Newly determined, Serena begins working with renowned fitness trainer Mackie Shilstone.

A few weeks later, Serena wins her third US Open title.Mackie Shilstone(fitness trainer): "I worked with Peyton Manning before his final season.
I've worked with thousands of professional athletes, some of the best in the world.
I evaluate them all on their mental toughness, and Serena is one of the most mentally tough individual athletes I have ever seen, man or woman, in 30 years of experience.

The number and diversity of people who call in to talk to her is incredible.
Normally if someone calls in, they have the product, are buying the product or want to talk about fashion.
With Serena, they feel they have a connection with her; they're calling in to talk with someone they know.
Everyone who appears on HSN gets a report card every visit.
Each time, she wants to do better than the last time, and she wants to know who else is doing well.
Isha: "She is completely invested in her fashion line.
It's not just 'show up and smile for the cameras at HSN.'
She has to understand what goes into making the clothes, why they chose that fashion.
Her days, they're nightmarish in terms of what she has to do in order to execute her life.
AUGUST 2009Coming off a win at Wimbledon and having won three of her past four majors, Serena makes it to the semifinal of the US Open, where she looks to defend her 2008 title.In the semifinal, Serena plays Clijsters, at the time an unseeded wild card who had last won the tournament in 2005, and loses the first set 6-4.
She bashes her racket on the court, earning her a warning for racket abuse.
In the second set, with Clijsters up 6-5 and Serena serving to send the set into a tiebreak, lineswoman Shino Tsurubuchi calls Serena for a foot fault on her second serve.
Serena argues the call, threatens the lineswoman by saying, "I swear to God I'm [expletive] going to take this [expletive] ball and shove it down your [expletive] throat," and is assessed a point penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct, ending the match.
Three months later, she is fined $82,500 and placed on a two-year probation.
It's the largest fine ever levied against a professional tennis player.Shriver: "Most every player would say how unlikely it would be for you to be playing a two-and-a-half-hour match and for the only foot fault to be called that late in the match.
That would have been Serena's initial anger.
Why, at this crucial moment, is this my first foot fault of the night?
It was a hurtful moment for her on many levels.
I don't think her intent was to lose it and say what she said.
I just think in the heat of the moment, it's what happened.
The publicity from that match and how she reacted was so difficult, so negative, that it didn't help her public popularity.
In the last year and a half, especially, when Serena has had challenging moments, she has been much more gracious, given the opponent more credit.
That doesn't mean she won't get mad and smack her racket and get upset.
She still has her moments, but that's normal.
But that was her worst moment.
Isha: "I felt like she was being denied an opportunity to make a mistake.
We've all said and done things we're not proud of because we're not perfect.
But she didn't have the ability to be human.
And nobody wants to feel like that, like I can't say anything, I can't do anything.
If I'm not swinging a racket, people don't see me as a person.
All they see is this sportsperson, and in this moment, as a woman and as a black woman, I'm not supposed to be able to express hurt when I know I'm being cheated.
That's taking my voice, taking my humanity.
So in that moment, I was most protective of her.
Everybody was like, 'You've got to apologize to the world because of what you said.'
That wasn't coming from [her family].
What we said was, 'Obviously it was a mistake; you absolutely owe the umpire an apology, but that's it.
And that should be something private between you and her.
Outside of that, whatever you feel you need to do to feel whole and be at peace about what happened, that's what you do.
Because that's the only way you can stay true to yourself.
What she learned is you have to keep yourself in check and handle your situations with dignity and grace.
Sometimes you have to be the bigger person, even on the court, calm down and know that it's just a game and understand the space it should hold in your life.
These are all parts of a bigger lesson.
Shilstone: "Some of her outbursts on the court, they have been misconstrued.
I was there when the woman called the foot fault.
That woman missed completely.
People don't think athletes are supposed to be human or have heart.
There is no malice with Serena.
It's the heat of the battle.
Afterwards she apologized, but that is forgotten.
Oracene: "It wasn't just that call.
All the years and emotions popped out at once.
Balls that were clearly in, that everyone in the stands could see were clearly in.
That was her breaking point.

But a nagging knee injury forces her to miss the next four months of tennis.
To fill her time, Serena researches schools and enrolls in a 240-hour course at Palm Beach Nail Academy to become a certified nail technician.
She says she plans to complete the course in one year while being the school's top student -- and its most fashionable.
She practices her new craft by giving Oprah Winfrey a pedicure on air.Isha: "She's always been obsessed with her nails.
And then it became, 'I could do this myself.
I'm going to nail school.'
She was completely fascinated.
I didn't believe her.
Then she got injured and couldn't play, and she enrolled herself in nail school.
Then these opportunities started coming in.
One day, she was like, 'If I do Oprah's nails, will it count for my hours?'
Absolutely.
Once she mastered it, it was almost like, 'OK, that's done.
Finished and check and on to the next thing.
What am I curious about now?
How do I want to grow now?
JULY 7, 2010Four days after winning Wimbledon, Serena is walking out of a restaurant in Munich when she steps on broken glass, lacerating a tendon on the top of her right foot.
This begins a bad run of health for Serena: In October, she reinjures the same tendon, forcing her to have season-ending surgery.
Then, in January, a pulmonary embolism is detected in her lungs.
Serena undergoes emergency treatment in March 2011 to remove a hematoma related to the embolism and is hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
Serena says the scary experience is as mentally difficult as the death of her sister.
She does not play again until June.Isha: "Seeing her in the hospital, in the bed, her eyes were closed, she was connected to tubes, and we didn't know the severity of the diagnosis, and I was terrified.
This was our baby sister.
When we found out everything, it became extremely real.
We'd already suffered loss, and it was unfathomable to me that we would get hit like that twice, with the first [sister] and the last.
It seemed like it wasn't even possible.
We all prayed.
Shilstone: "A couple of months later, we were training in West Palm Beach and she was fit, but she was grabbing her chair.
She was wheezing.
I realized she was still suffering from the pulmonary embolism.
It was the battle of our lives.
Before her next match, I told her, 'You've been introduced to death.
You can't be worried about the woman on the other side of the net.
JUNE 2011Away from tennis for nearly a year, Serena returns to the court but struggles to find her game.
She loses in the fourth round at Wimbledon and drops to No.
175, her lowest ranking since 1997.
Then she loses in the final of the US Open in September.
Around this time, the ever-curious Serena begins taking online classes at UMass University Without Walls.
Her major is business management, which she later switches to pre-med.
On the court, her losing streak continues into 2012: She gets knocked out in the fourth round of the Australian Open in January and in the first round of the French Open in May.
It is her first loss in the opening round of a Grand Slam -- and the last straw.
Having recently been introduced to French tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou by her friend and fellow pro Grigor Dimitrov, Serena reaches out to Mouratoglou.Patrick Mouratoglou(Serena's coach since 2012): "A few days after her [French Open] loss, she called and asked if she could come to the academy to practice.
Most players leave town after they lose.
She said, 'I want to practice because I want to win Wimbledon.'
She wanted to get back to winning a Grand Slam and being No.
She hadn't won a Grand Slam for two years and was very disappointed.
I said yes, and she asked for two hitting partners.
She came and hit for 45 minutes.
I was there but was not supposed to say anything to her.
At the changeover, she sat down, turned to me and said, 'Speak to me.'
So I spoke to her.
Then she said, 'Can we start now?'
And I said, 'Of course.
2012With Mouratoglou, Serena works on her serve placement and tactics, as well as her confidence and conditioning.
In April, in another unconventional move for a top player two decades into her career, Serena switches from natural gut to hybrid racket strings.
Three months later, she wins Wimbledon for the fifth time.
She follows that performance by winning two Olympic gold medals, in singles and doubles, at the London Games.Serena Williams at Wimbledon in 2012.Antoine Couvercelle/Panoramic/Icon SportswireMouratoglou: "She fought incredibly at Wimbledon.
She is always a fighter but maybe more in that tournament than ever.
She was coming to the matches with a plan.
Of course, winning Wimbledon made a big difference in terms of her confidence.
It's the same for every player ... the more you win, the more you win.
Fernandez: "At the Olympics, she went through the draw without dropping games.
I've never seen anything like it.
We're used to how great she serves, but it wasn't only her serve.
It was her returns, her groundstrokes, her volleys.
She beat players like [Victoria] Azarenka and Sharapova without losing games.
It was remarkable.
It's the best I've seen her play.

Serena, a longtime Nike spokeswoman, jokes that she will one day succeed Parker as president of the company.Mark Parker(president and CEO of Nike): "I joined Serena to watch the men's US Open final between [Rafael] Nadal and [Novak] Djokovic.
I asked her what she thought of the match, and she told me she had been taking mental notes on how to improve her own game -- the day after winning the Open.
During the [2015 Australian] Open, I texted her and asked what she was doing between matches.
I found out she was taking pre-med courses.
Isha: "She loves holistic medicine.
It's a real part of her study and what she wants to do.
She's actually really good at it.
We have this family event we do, and Serena wrapped me.
She knows the muscles and the bones.
It's almost irritating.
It's like, how much can you learn?
She wanted to speak French, so she's fluent in French.
Whatever she sets her mind to do, she goes after it with so much enthusiasm and commitment until she gets it done.
There are so few people in the universe who do that.

The goal is to win the four Grand Slams.
When I work with someone like Serena, what else can you have?
MARCH 13, 2015Serena returns to Indian Wells after a 13-year boycott of the tournament.
A knee injury forces her to withdraw in the semifinals.Isha: "She talked to my mom and dad and then came to me and said, 'I'm thinking about going back to Indian Wells.'
I said, 'Really?
Are you ready for that?'
It took her to come to a place where she was understanding of who she was and how far she had come, so that Indian Wells didn't matter.
You have to get to a place in yourself where, win, lose or draw, I'm doing this for me.
I'm not doing it for anybody else.
I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do for me at this point in my life.
And to watch that process and see the reception she got, it was overwhelming.
All the years when people were asking, 'Are you coming back?'
Saying, 'Come back, please come back.'
Now it was not anybody asking her -- but her making the decision.
I was extremely proud because I don't know if I could have done it.
She taught us all in that moment.
Garrison(former professional tennis player, second African-American woman to make a Grand Slam final, at Wimbledon, 1990): "I think she's learned a lot about forgiveness over the years.
What she did last year at [Indian Wells] blew my mind, made me cry.
The fact that she's been big enough to humble herself in that way and show forgiveness was a strong statement for the times we live in right now, when young people need to see a leader like that.
She said it felt right to her.
Forgiveness was a big part of it, and not wanting to dwell on it anymore.
That kind of energy brings you down, when you're holding on to old anger.
The fact that she got to forgiveness, that can only be done by looking into yourself, deciding to be the best person you can be and making changes within yourself.
MAY 2015After reading Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's bestseller "Lean In," Serena strikes up a friendship with Sandberg and her husband, Dave, in early 2015.
When Dave dies of a heart attack in May, Serena reaches out to comfort her friend.Lyndrea: "Serena is the type of person who will call you to make sure you're OK. She'll call every 10 minutes if she thinks something is wrong.
She'll sense this.
Sheryl Sandberg lost her husband, and she did this for Sheryl for, like, months on end, every day.
In order to help someone else, you have to have been through it.
You go through things so you can uplift someone else.
And that's what Serena did.
I'm most proud of her in those moments.
It's not about money, press, fame.
It's about human connection.

She would stay the whole day on the sofa and try to go out for a walk for 10 minutes and come back after two minutes.
Not being able to sleep and having so much fever throughout most of the tournament, from the second round to the semis, then to play at the highest level, in the sun, and win against the best players in the world was impressive.
JULY 11, 2015Serena beats Garbine Muguruza 6-4, 6-4 to win Wimbledon for the sixth time and, at 33 years, 289 days, becomes the oldest player to win a Grand Slam singles title.
With the win, she earns her second Serena Slam by holding all four major titles at once.
She is one win from tying Graf's record of 22 Grand Slam wins and becoming the first woman since Graf in 1988 to complete the calendar-year Grand Slam.Mouratoglou: "Before winning Wimbledon, she had won two Grand Slams, but it's only two.
For her, it's not incredible.
But when she won the third, you start to think, 'Now we are getting close to something big.

15, 2015At the Rogers Cup in Toronto, the warm-up to the US Open,Serena loses to Swiss teen Belinda Bencic in the semifinals.Mouratoglou: "She comes to me the morning after and says, 'We have to go practice; I'm tired of losing.'
We were in August.
She'd lost three matches ... in a year.
Shilstone: "We do a thing called the Mackie Short Shuttle.
It's a series of sprints with recovery time between them, and the sprints and the rest get progressively shorter as the workout goes on, but they go up in number.
When we first started, Serena was falling out at different times.
Last year before the US Open, she did all 72 sprints for the first time.
After the tournament, she said, 'Those doggone sprints, they saved me.
I can go forever.'"SEPT.
8, 2015Serena advances to the US Open quarterfinals, where she beats sister Venus.
Then, in one of the most shocking upsets in tennis history, Serena loses to unseeded Roberta Vinci in the semifinals.Mouratoglou: "On this morning, I saw that she was in a bad day.
She had a lot of pain in her knees and the stress went higher.
There was clearly big pressure from the outside.
The US Open advertising was about her only.
Vinci played the match of her life, and Serena made more mistakes than usual and would not go 100 percent on her shots.
She couldn't hit as many winners as usual.
The good thing, and it's what I've told her, whether you do this or not, it is not going to change who you are in your career.
You've won 21 Grand Slams.
You are going to win others.
You are going to beat the record of all time.
Roberta Vinci(professional tennis player currently ranked No.
8): "Before the match, I spoke with my coach.
He said, 'Don't think that this is your first semifinal in singles.
Enjoy the moment.'
There are no tactics against Serena.
At the beginning, I was nervous.
But I think Serena was more nervous than me.
She had a lot of pressure.
Until the end, I said in my mind, it's impossible that I can win, but try to stay focused every single point.
Don't think about Serena.
Roberta Vinci celebrates a point against Serena Williams during a 2015 US Open semifinal.
Vinci would later win the match.Mike Stobe/Getty Images for the USTAGarrison: "In the tennis community, that loss to Vinci doesn't take anything away from Serena.
I was at the match.
I knew the pressure would hit her, I just didn't know how and when.
When Steffi did it, she didn't have social media.
Serena couldn't get away from it if she wanted to.
Mouratoglou: "For quite a while, she was really down because she felt like she failed.
I let them down.'
She didn't want to see people.
Even though she's had more success than anyone, when she fails, it is more painful than for anyone else.
Other players lose every week, or out of 30 weeks, they lose 27 or 28 times.
She does not.
She had to go through this process.
She knew she had time, so she wanted to stay away from tennis, so she did."SEPT.
15, 2015At New York Fashion Week, Serena presents her fall 2015 collection with Home Shopping Network in front of Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, models Gigi Hadid and Lily Aldridge, and Drake.
She announces in October that she'll withdraw from the final tournaments of the season, the WTA Finals and the China Open.Serena Williams takes a bow after her fashion line's show during New York Fashion Week in 2015.Fernando Leon/Getty ImagesGrossman: "She had just come off a disappointment at the US Open, and she put herself into this show.
She cast all the models.
She styled and accessorized every outfit, worked with the hair and makeup artists.
She chose every piece of music.
During the show, she was behind the scenes making sure the models were going out at the right cadence; everybody is put together in the right way.
At the end, she came out and took a bow and looked fabulous in one of her creations.
DECEMBER 2015Sports Illustratednames Serena its Sportsperson of the Year, the first solo female to be awarded the honor since middle-distance runner Mary Decker in 1983.
Serena is criticized for the magazine's cover image, in which she is wearing a black lacy bodysuit and stilettos and is seated on a golden throne.Garrison: "Richard and Oracene did a very good job of making all of their girls comfortable within their own skin.
Venus and Serena told me that their mom told them every day that they were beautiful, strong women.
To hear that every day, and then believe it, is amazing.
I've struggled with my weight for years.
She tells me, 'Keep going, don't stop.'
She's just as encouraging to people around her as she is to the world.
I don't think she tries to be a role model to girls, I think she's just true to herself, and that's enough.
She doesn't have to prove anything to the doubters anymore.
Oracene: "Other athletes would read things in the press and then couldn't do their jobs.
So I made them stay away from press.
Nothing negative inside their heads.
Once you put fear in your head and get scared and doubt yourself, you can collapse.
To be successful, you have to have confidence in who you are and what you stand for and the hell with whatever they say.
The girls used to say, 'Mom, why do you say you don't care?'
Because I don't care what people think.
I know who I am.

She came to me after and was so happy for me that I won my first Grand Slam.
This is what is special about her; she was so nice after a really tough match that she lost.
Mouratoglou: "All that period, she played good tennis.
But one of the things that makes Serena Serena is her mental toughness, her ability to play unbelievable when it's necessary, and this disappeared.
She lost it.
During that period, she was playing very good tennis.
But this killer instinct, she didn't have it.
She was not Serena.

I hung up and turned to my business partner and said, 'Serena's back.'
She talked to me in a way that was Serena.
The champion's mentality, all the things that make her so special, came back.
I don't know why it came back at that time.
Maybe the loss at the French was one too many.
You never know why it clicks.
But it clicked.
AUGUST 2016A shoulder injury forces Serena to pull out of the Rogers Cup.
But nothing, she says, will keep her from playing in the Rio Olympics.
Clearly struggling with pain, she loses in the third round of singles and first round of doubles play and returns home to Palm Beach, Florida, to rehab and prepare for the US Open.Fernandez: "She was a great leader at the Olympics.
She walked in the opening ceremony and went to the village a couple of times.
She and Venus are big on pin trading, and Serena showed the rookies how to get the most pins.
Even though she wasn't 100 percent, she tried her best to get fit and healthy.
She didn't want to miss it.
I will remember how excited she was to be back at the Olympics.
Mouratoglou: "She was injured.
She couldn't serve.
She had pain playing.
If it was any other tournament, she wouldn't have played.
Afterward she took a day off, and we got back to work.

12, 2016Home in Florida, Serena Snapchats a video of herself performing her version of the routine that won U.S. gymnast Simone Biles all-around gold the day before in Rio.Mouratoglou: "She had watched gymnastics on TV.
She started to do it and then laughed at herself and said, 'Film me.'
If I can say something of her character, she is more open to people now.
The documentary was the first step.
Snapchat is continuing the same.
She hasn't changed, but people are getting to know her."AUG.
22, 2016Serena arrives in New York to begin training for the US Open.Shilstone: "I only have a week to get her ready, so we do crazy things.
I hooked her up to cables that launch her like an F-18 to work on acceleration and deceleration while changing direction.
We do standing bike sprints.
There's a drill I call the fun 'n' gun that's based on my work with Army Rangers.
If you look at the motion of the server, it's the same as the release of a shot put, so I have her shot-put a medicine ball."SEPT.

Two weeks later, she turns 35.Isha: "My first conversation with Serena after that match was, 'What are you watching on TV?'
I went to her room at the hotel, and we all chilled together and it wasn't about tennis.
It was about being sisters and hanging out, and that's what we did, all of us.
She still took her time, and you knew that's what she was thinking about.
But it's not what we talked about.
When did she start thinking about next season and the Australian Open?
The moment she stepped off the court, she was already there.

11, 2016Accompanied by her sisters, mother, niece and nephews, Serena returns to Compton for the first time in years to open the Yetunde Price Resource Center in honor of her late sister.
The next day, she and her family return to the East Compton tennis courts where she and Venus learned the game to dedicate newly refurbished courts to the community.Aja Brown(Mayor of Compton): "The impact her presence has on this city is phenomenal.
Her coming back is truly a beacon of light.
She and Venus were awesome ambassadors and helped to lift the city in a time when it was really tough to be here.
The city was plagued with violence and had so many negative connotations with the name Compton.
But when we were able to turn on the TV and see Serena winning, dominating the game of tennis, we all felt uplifted.
I was a little girl watching her do things I never thought were possible, so to be able to introduce her today was a great honor.
Isha: "Serena's doing this 30-day challenge, where she wants to do cardio every day for 30 days.
This is a person who doesn't enjoy working out.
When we got back to the hotel, it was late.
Serena was like, 'I've got to work out.
I'm committed to these 30 days.'
She went to the gym and did her cardio and then was so energized.
Her dedication is inspiring.
She's helped all of us."DEC.
30, 2016In a 14-line poem posted to her page on Reddit, Serena announces her engagement to the website's co-founder Alexis Ohanian, whom she's been dating for a year-and-a-half.
On his Facebook page, Ohanian posts the words "She said yes," as well as links to Serena's Reddit post.Shilstone: "Serena called me and said, 'Guess what, Mackie?
I'm engaged!'
She knows I don't follow Twitter and all that.
And I said, 'Wow, you're getting married!
But what are we first?
We're warriors.'
I was saying to her, 'Keep your head in the game.'
I've been around for eight years, so I've seen a lot of people come and go, and this young man is the real deal.
He is a genuine, nice man and she is very happy.
I told her, 'Serena, now you'll have to set me up on Reddit like you did on Twitter.
JANUARY 2017In swirling windy weather, Serena loses 6-4, 6-7 (3), 6-4 to American Madison Brengle in the second round of the ASB Classic in New Zealand, her first tournament since the US Open.
After the match, she calls the conditions "my least-favorite I've ever played in" and turns her focus to the Australian Open.Shilstone: "We've been conferring a lot since the US Open.
She took a tremendous amount of time off to contend with injuries.
Right now, she has some ring rust, and it's going to take a little time to shake it off.
Tennis is all about timing, and right now, she's working on her timing.
She needs to get it back, and you do that by playing games.
She's a seasoned veteran, so it won't take her long.
On the first day I met her in New Orleans eight years ago, I asked her, 'Are you at your best?'
She said, 'I don't think I've ever been at my best.'
If I asked her that question today, I am willing to say she'd tell me the same thing -- because the minute she says, 'Yeah, I'm the best I can be,' it's over.
Isha: "I want to see her win 23 for her.
She is her own worst critic, her toughest competition, and she's really hard on herself when she doesn't succeed.
I'd like to see her win it as soon as possible, but for her.
Not for me, not for anybody else.
I want that so badly for her.
Mouratoglou: "It was good thing she lost early.
It helped her to regroup and get ready for the Australian Open.
Of course, winning would be good, too, but losing was a wake-up call.
Not that she was not doing the right things.
She prepared well, but she realized that if she is not 100 percent focused in a match, she can lose.
Going into Australia, she knew she had to be 100 percent focused in the first two rounds."JAN.
28, 2017At 5:03 a.m.
ET, Serena defeats big sister Venus 6-4, 6-4 in Melbourne to win her seventh Australian Open title and capture her 23rd Grand Slam, giving her more Grand Slam titles than any player in the Open era.
There is no arguing it any longer: Serena is the greatest.After the match, Venus addresses the crowd first.
She motions toward Serena and says, "That's my little sister, guys.
Congratulations, Serena, on No.
23.
I have been right there with you.
Your win has always been my win.
I think you know that I'm enormously proud of you."
Serena responds in her speech by saying, "I really would like to take this moment to congratulate Venus.
She's an amazing person.
There's no way I would be at 23 without her.
There's no way I'd be at one without her.
There's no way I'd have anything without her.
She's my inspiration -- she's the only reason I'm standing here today and the only reason the Williams sisters exist.
Serena Williams reacts after winning her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open.SAEED KHAN/AFP/Getty ImagesGarrison: "I watched.
Of course I watched.
The match was very emotional.
Their speeches were heartfelt and humbling, and I heard them speak like I hadn't in a long time.
I've known Serena and Venus since they were 7 and 8, and to watch them grow as women on and off the court, overcome all they have, to play in their 30s the way they are playing, it's amazing.
They are making their own rules.
Being Serena's mentor when she came on tour, she has defied all odds against what people thought she could do.
I will never forget Billie Jean King saying to me one day when Serena was young, 'She can be the greatest of all time if she hones it all in.'
To watch her wisdom and physical and mental abilities come together to win 23 is exciting.
She understands her place in history.
Mouratoglou: "It was very emotional.
It's the first time since the start of my career with Serena that I had more stress than usual, the whole day.
I felt the weight of the history.
I tried to hide it as much as I could to her, but there was much more pressure.
I don't think playing Venus was a big deal for her.
I think the importance of winning the 23rd Slam was much more important than who she plays.
She obviously prefers to play someone else but was focused on finding a way to win.
She doesn't like to play Venus, but she was happy that Venus was in a final again and back to a great level.
There was positive and negative.
What's next is to establish her own record.
Will it be 23, 25, 30?
Nobody knows.
But I think it's the most exciting journey for someone like Serena, to make her record.
Of course she is still enjoying the game.
Otherwise she would have stopped.
She loves to play, but she also loves the idea of winning Grand Slams and exploring foreign territory.
The fact that we don't know where we're going next, and how far we're going to go, makes it more exciting than beating any record.
She is leaving a trace in history and I want this trace to be as big as possible.

It’s just two months after the tennis titans went toe to toe at the Top Seed Open in Kentucky, which was their first time back on the court since the forced hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The world-famous pair, who have played many roles in each other’s lives in the 23 years since their first match against each other—best friends, former teammates, competitors, and longtime roommates—are giggling as they reflect on the five-year journey of collaborating on their greatest joint effort yet: designing Serena’s dream home.After co-owning a Palm Beach Gardens property where the Grand Slam duo lived together on and off since 1998, with Serena splitting her time between secondary homes from Bel-Air to Paris, she purchased a sprawling waterfront property of her own, with breathtaking views in a coveted enclave north of Miami, just minutes away from Venus and their parents.
To help make the house ideal for her own family, naturally she turned to V Starr, Venus’s world-class design firm.A grouping of pendant lamps byTom Dixon(brass) andSimon Legald for Normann Copenhagen(Glass) sets the tone in the dining room.

Wall covering byPhillip Jeffries; custom Banquette and Fama chairs in aBrentanovelvet.Lelanie Foster“I was moving away from Venus for the first time in my life, so I wanted it to be really meaningful,” Serena says.
While mixing family with business can be risky, the secret to their success as siblings and creative collaborators is simple: “You have to know your lane.
I’m really good at playing tennis; I’m not as good at interiors.
But I was able to learn through just watching Venus.”As with any other client, Venus says, her priority was catering to Serena’s vision—which did a complete 180 during the design process.
After she purchased the 14,500-square-foot Spanish Mediterranean–style home, Serena’s traditional tastes suddenly felt out of step with this new phase of life.
She credits her love of modern art and technology for ushering in a more modern, minimalist aesthetic.
Then, of course, there was the burgeoning romance with tech tycoon Alexis Ohanian.
The high-profile couple had only recently begun dating just after Serena embarked upon this massive real estate project, but Sonya Haffey, principal of V Starr, says Serena’s future family goals were an integral part of the design plans all along.Last July—after three years, including a gut renovation—Serena finally moved into the completely reimagined, ultra-modern, intracoastal property with a husband and toddler in tow.
As the old adage goes, “If you build it, they will come.” Though, they all maintain, it was mostly Serena’s singular imagination—with guidance from V Starr—that spearheaded the design.RHpendant lights hang above a trapezoidal table.Officine Gulloappliances; Brizo sink fittings;Caesarstonecountertop.Lelanie FosterAVictoria + Alberttub stands in the bath.Brizotub and Shower fittings.

And I wasn’t going to be like, ‘Hey, let’s do this together.’ That would have been really weird for him,” she says with a chuckle.
Yeah.
That would’ve been kind of creepy,” Venus chimes in.While Ohanian played the easygoing, supporting role to Serena’s more hands-on approach, one space the doting dad took the lead on perfecting was their three-year-old daughter’s bedroom.
Both parents agree the pièce de résistance of their entire home is Olympia’s pink custom-designed castle bed complete with a built-in slide and an equally spectacular, one-of-a-kind chandelier created by blown-glass artist Josh Fradis.
Indeed, it is positively fit for a princess.“She goes down the slide every night while we’re thinking, Man, we shouldn’t have done that, because now at bedtime, she just wants to slide,” Serena admits.
But whatever makes her happy makes me happy.”While Olympia’s room is decidedly the most extravagant space in the house, Serena insisted on exercising a bit more restraint in other areas.
The marriage of sleek, clean lines and high-end features with warm woods and casual touches that complement Serena’s laid-back vibe resulted in a cohesive visual narrative that embodies Serena’s newly evolved design aesthetic, which Haffey calls “livable luxury,” adding that the client was a well of creativity, serving up references from hotels she’s stayed at all over the world.Art on display in the gallery includes works by (from left) Leonardo drew, Radcliffe Bailey, and David Kracov, as well as a Kaws x Campana chair, a live-edge wood bench, a piece from the Konyak Naga tribe of India, and a Vintage Wurlitzer piano.
Floors are wide plank European Oak byHakwood.Lelanie Foster“Serena is not formal,” Venus notes.
She’s fun-loving; she’s very free, and not someone who wants to sit in a chair and serve someone tea.
So it had to be a very welcoming space.”At Serena’s request, the V Starr team came up with an out-of-the-box design solution to refashion what was once a classical Floridian-style foyer and formal sitting room with beautiful chairs no one sat in, into a colorful art space with eccentric pieces on display.
When you walk in, it’s like walking into an art gallery,” says Serena.
That’s my favorite part of the house.
It’s so unique.
I’ve never seen anything like it.”Venus adds: “I am not a fan of just having spaces to have them.
Maybe some people use their formal living rooms, but we don’t.
So we created a space that she can actually use and enjoy and live with the art, and invite other people to absorb it and have that emotional connection as soon as you walk in.
It sets the tone for the rest of the home.”Williams, poolside in Gucci and Serena Williams jewelry.

Among the many standout features of the home are heated floors in the bathrooms, a sauna in the gym, a wine cellar the size of a small NYC apartment, an expansive terrace offering indoor/outdoor living spaces that overlooks an infinity pool complete with submerged chaise longues, Serena’s 620-square-foot closet fashioned after a luxe retail space, and a private trophy room to house the superstar athlete’s many awards.
But there is one amenity that’s noticeably absent: a tennis court.“I wanted to separate home from work,” Serena says.
I love being home.
When you have our job, you never get time to relax.
So it’s good for me to be able to sit still and not do anything.”Moving into your dream home during a global pandemic no doubt has its challenges, but for this jet-setting athlete and mogul, being unexpectedly homebound for months has offered a welcome reprieve.
The perks include ample quality time nesting with her young family, and a chance to hone her cooking chops.
To that end, nailing the kitchen design was of supreme importance to Serena, who is the self-proclaimed cook of the family.
The remit: “Somewhere in-between ‘super impressive’ and ‘Come in and grab something out of the fridge,’  ” Venus shares.
So we had to find that balance within the design.” Devised in consultation with Serena’s private chef, it was outfitted by V Starr with the finest appliances, including Gaggenau wall ovens, an Officine Gullo cooktop, and customized gold and black marble backsplash in a diamond-pattern mosaic that over-delivers in wow factor.1/ 16ChevronChevronPhoto: Lelanie Foster; Styling: Mieke ten HaveA guest room is painted inBenjamin Moore’s River Blue.
Furniture fromWest Elm.Tennis, tech, and fashion empire-building aside, one of Serena’s favorite Williams family pastimes is karaoke.
After winning the U.S. Open, the world champions would celebrate in a private karaoke room on 50th Street in Manhattan.
Naturally, Serena had to have one of her own.
So, just off the gallery, behind a secret doorway disguised as a bookshelf, lies a karaoke room.
This unusual amenity features a small stage, a plush aquamarine velvet banquette, and foliage framing a neon sign that spells sérénade, a playful tribute to Serena’s karaoke persona.Of course, she and her sister even sing karaoke like it’s a competitive sport.

1980), a seven-timeGrand Slamtitle winner (singles), andSerena Williams(b.
1981), twenty-three-time Grand Slam title winner (singles), both of whom were coached from an early age by their parentsRichard WilliamsandOracene Price.Both sisters have been ranked by theWomen's Tennis Associationat the world No.
1 position in bothsinglesanddoubles.
In 2002, after the French Open, Venus and Serena Williams were ranked world No.
1 and No.
2 on singles, respectively, marking the first time in history that sisters occupied the top two positions.
On 21 June 2010, Serena and Venus again held the No.
2 rankings spots in singles, respectively, some eight years after first accomplishing this feat.
At the time, Serena was three months shy of her 29th birthday and Venus had just celebrated her 30th birthday.There is anoted professional rivalrybetween the sisters in singles — between the2001 US Openand the2017 Australian Open, they contested nine major finals.
They became the first two players, female or male, to contest four consecutive major singles finals, from the2002 French Opento the2003 Australian Open; Serena famously won all four to complete the first of two "Serena Slams" (non-calendar year Grand Slams).
Between 2000 and 2016, they collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles (Venus five, and Serena seven).
Nonetheless, they remain very close, often watching each other's matches in support, even after one of them had been knocked out of a tournament.By winning the2001 Australian Open doubles title, they became the fifth pair of women to complete thecareer Grand Slamin doubles, and the only pair to complete thecareer Golden Slamin doubles.
At the time, Venus and Serena were only 20 and 19 years old, respectively.
Since then, they have gone on to add another two Olympic gold medals at the2008 Beijing Olympicsand the2012 London Olympics.
Moreover, the duo would go on to win a non-calendar year Grand Slam in doubles between2009 Wimbledonand2010 Roland Garros, which made them theco-No.
1 doubles playerson 7 June 2010.
Their most recent major doubles title came at the2016 Wimbledon Championships.Both players have won four gold medals at theOlympics, one each in singles and three in doubles— all won together— the most of any tennis players.
Venus has also won a silver in mixed doubles at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
As a duo, they have also completed thedouble career Golden Slamin doubles.
Between the two of them, they have completed theBoxed Set, winning all four grand slams in singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles.
They split all four mixed doubles titles in 1998.Doubles: 23 (22 titles, 1 runner-up)[edit]Winner — LegendGrand Slamtournaments (14–0)Olympic Gold (3)WTA Tour Championships (0–0)Premier Mandatory & Premier 5 (2–0)Premier (2–1)International (1–0)Finals by SurfaceHard (10–1)Grass (7–0)Clay (3–0)Carpet (2–0)ResultNo.DateTournamentsSurfaceOpponentsScoreWin1.February 23, 1998Oklahoma City,United States(1)HardCătălina CristeaKristine Kunce7–5, 6–2Win2.October 12, 1998Zürich,Switzerland(1)CarpetMariaan de SwardtElena Tatarkova5–7, 6–1, 6–3Win3.February 15, 1999Hannover,Germany(1)CarpetAlexandra FusaiNathalie Tauziat5–7, 6–2, 6–2Win4.May 24, 1999French Open,Paris,France(1)ClayMartina HingisAnna Kournikova6–3, 6–7(2–7), 8–6Loss1.August 8, 1999San Diego, U.S.(1)HardLindsay DavenportCorina Morariu4–6, 1–6Win5.August 30, 1999US Open,New York City, U.S.(1)HardChanda RubinSandrine Testud4–6, 6–1, 6–4Win6.June 26, 2000Wimbledon,London,United Kingdom(1)GrassJulie Halard-DecugisAi Sugiyama6–3, 6–2Win7.September 18, 2000Summer Olympics,Sydney,Australia(1)HardKristie BoogertMiriam Oremans6–1, 6–1Win8.January 15, 2001Australian Open,Melbourne, Australia(1)HardLindsay DavenportCorina Morariu6–2, 4–6, 6–4Win9.June 24, 2002Wimbledon, London, U.K.(2)GrassVirginia Ruano PascualPaola Suárez6–2, 7–5Win10.January 13, 2003Australian Open, Melbourne, Australia(2)HardVirginia Ruano PascualPaola Suárez4–6, 6–4, 6–3Win11.July 5, 2008Wimbledon, London, U.K.(3)GrassLisa RaymondSamantha Stosur6–2, 6–2Win12.August 17, 2008Summer Olympics,Beijing,China(2)HardAnabel Medina GarriguesVirginia Ruano Pascual6–2, 6–0Win13.January 30, 2009Australian Open, Melbourne, Australia(3)HardAi SugiyamaDaniela Hantuchová6–3, 6–3Win14.July 4, 2009Wimbledon, London, U.K.(4)GrassSamantha StosurRennae Stubbs7–6(7–4), 6–4Win15.August 2, 2009Stanford, U.S.(1)HardChan Yung-janMonica Niculescu6–4, 6–1Win16.September 14, 2009US Open, New York City, U.S.(2)HardCara BlackLiezel Huber6–2, 6–2Win17.January 29, 2010Australian Open, Melbourne, Australia(4)HardCara BlackLiezel Huber6–4, 6–3Win18.May 15, 2010Madrid,Spain(1)ClayGisela DulkoFlavia Pennetta6–2, 7–5Win19.June 3, 2010French Open, Paris, France(2)ClayKvěta PeschkeKatarina Srebotnik6–2, 6–3Win20.July 7, 2012Wimbledon, London, U.K.(5)GrassAndrea HlaváčkováLucie Hradecká7–5, 6–4Win21.August 5, 2012Summer Olympics,London,U.K.

Venus partnered with AmericanChanda Rubinand lost in the first round to eventual gold-medalistsSun TiantianandLi Ting.Boycott of the Indian Wells Masters[edit]During the2001 Indian Wells Masterstournament inIndian Wells, California, controversy erupted whenVenus Williamswithdrew four minutes prior to her semifinal match with her sisterSerena.
1]The following day, Serena playedKim Clijstersin the final.
Venus and her father, (coach to her and Serena)Richard Williamswere booed as they made their way to their seats.
1]Serena was booed intermittently during the final, in which she defeated Clijsters, 4–6, 6–4, 6–2, and even during the presentation ceremony.
1]Richard accused the crowds at Indian Wells of overt racism, saying, "The white people at Indian Wells, what they've been wanting to say all along to us finally came out: 'Nigger, stay away from here, we don't want you here'".
However, no other reports of verbal racism were reported to tournament officials, although Venus has stated without elaboration, "I heard what he heard.
1][2]Oracene Price(mother and coach of Venus and Serena) accused the crowd of "taking off their hoods".
3]Effects and criticism[edit]After the initial controversy, neither Williams sister played thetournament in Indian Wellsfor 14 years.
TheWomen's Tennis Associationcurrently classifies the Indian Wells tournament as aPremier Mandatoryevent for all eligible players.
1]Exceptions are made when players engage in tournament promotions, but Venus and Serena both declined to promote the tournament; WTA Tour CEOLarry Scottagreed he would not, promotionally, "put them in a position that is going to be awkward," and tournament director Charlie Pasarell has stated he would accept the WTA tour's ruling.
1]Allegations had been made before Venus's withdrawal that Richard Williams decided who won the matches between his daughters.
4]Those allegations continued and increased as a result of her withdrawal.
1]Richard has said that racial epithets were used against him and Venus as they sat in the stands during the final, but no official complaints were recorded by the tournament.
Venus and Serena have been criticized for refusing to discuss the controversy, as some believe that their silence perpetuates racism.
5]Serena discusses what happened in her view at Indian Wells in detail in an entire chapter titled "The Fiery Darts of Indian Wells" in her 2009 autobiography,On the Line.
She says that on the morning of the semifinal, Venus told the tour trainer that she had injured her knee and didn't think she could play and tried for hours to get approval from the trainer to withdraw, but the tournament officials kept stalling.What got me most of all was that it wasn't just a scattered bunch of boos.
It wasn't coming from just one section.
It was like the whole crowd got together and decided to boo all at once.
The ugliness was just raining down on me, hard.
I didn't know what to do.
Nothing like this had ever happened to me.
What was most surprising about this uproar was the fact that tennis fans are typically a well-mannered bunch.
They're respectful.
They sit still.
And in Palm Springs, especially, they tended to be pretty well-heeled, too.
But I looked up and all I could see was a sea of rich people—mostly older, mostly white—standing and booing lustily, like some kind of genteel lynch mob.
I don't mean to use such inflammatory language to describe the scene, but that's really how it seemed from where I was down on the court.
Like these people were gonna come looking for me after the match.
...
There was no mistaking that all of this was meant for me.
I heard the wordniggera couple times, and I knew.
I couldn't believe it.
That's just not something you hear in polite society on that stadium court ... Just before the start of play, my dad and Venus started walking down the aisle to the players' box by the side of the court, and everybody turned and started to point and boo at them ...
It was mostly just a chorus of boos, but I could still hear shouts of 'Nigger!'
here and there.
I even heard one angry voice telling us to go back to Compton.
It was unbelievable ... We refused to return to Indian Wells.
Even now, all these years later, we continue to boycott the event.
It's become a mandatory tournament on the tour, meaning that the WTA can fine a player if she doesn't attend.
But I don't care if they fine me a million dollars, I will not play there again.However, on February 3, 2015, Serena Williams wrote an exclusive column forTimemagazine stating her intentions to return to Indian Wells for a tournament on March 9, 2015.
She did indeed return and won her opening match.
6]Williams withdrew before her semi-final match withSimona Halepbecause of a knee injury.
7]The WTA announced on January 27, 2016, that Venus would return to Indian Wells for the first time in 15 years.

I'm trying to get through this.
I'm trying to get away, I'm trying to get her to safety," Wormleytold theLos Angeles Timesin 2003.
Once I get to Long Beach Boulevard, I see the back window is shattered.
I look to the right and said, 'Baby, are you all right?'
I look at [Price], and there was blood everywhere.
Frantic, Wormley took Price to his mother's house not far away, where she called 911.
Price was pronounced dead at an area hospital not long after.
She was 31.She was the oldest sister ofSerenaandVenus Williams.
She'd been shot about a mile and a half from the tennis courts where her younger sisters learned to play the sport that made them stars.
When [Venus and Serena] received the calls from all of us here, they were saying, 'Are you sure this is correct?'
They couldn't believe it," a spokeswoman for the family told PEOPLE in the days after Price died.This account of Price's slaying and its subsequent investigation — a 15-year-old homicide thrust again into the spotlight bythe release of her killer, according to authorities — is based onprevious PEOPLE reportingas well as articles from theAssociated Press, theL.A.

Photo by Sylvain Gaboury/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images)The Williams' sister's sudden death sent shockwaves through the close-knit family.
Venus got the news in New York City, where she was visiting for Fashion Week.
Serena was in Toronto filming for the cable seriesStreet Timeand, by one account, became visibly distraught when she learned her sister had been fatally shot.
Both flew to L.A., where they were joined by mom Oracene (who had Price in a previous relationship), and their dad, Richard.In those first hours and days afterward, however, it remained unclear exactly what happened, with witnesses giving differing accounts that suggested there had been an altercation before the shooting that involved Price and Wormley.In fact, investigators would learn the gunman had opened fire on their vehicle as they drove down the boulevard by a suspected drug house.
Wormley maintained the attack was unprovoked, though prosecutors argued the shooting was revenge against another gang.Apprehension of the accused was no less fraught: Whileone of the alleged shooterswas taken into custody within hours, the second,Robert Edward Maxfield, was not caught until January 2004, following months of tracking by law enforcement.Maxfield, whom police said was a member of the Southside Crips,was arrested in a raidin Athens, Calif.
He was unsuccessfully tried twice for murder before pleading no contest to a lesser charge just before the start of his third trial.
A no-contest plea essentially has the same effect as a guilty plea, but the defendant does not admit the accusations against them.

Then, he was arrested again in Compton for allegedly violating his parole.
Efforts to reach him directly or a previous attorney in his case were unsuccessful.Speaking generally, a spokesman for the state's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation told PEOPLE that someone who violates their parole then goes before a judge could have their parole revoked, at which point they would be sent back to jail.The DOC's Luis Patiño confirmed that the possible parole violation was being investigated.Al Seib/Los Angeles Times via GettyCalifornia Department of Corrections and RehabilitationMeanwhile, in the wake of Price's killing, the Williams family grieved and healed — slowly.
She was a wonderful person," Serena said in 2004.
We're dealing with it however we can.
Some days are better than others.
Serena appeared at Maxfield's court hearings for the first time when he was sentenced in 2006.
According to theTimes, she told him that, while she hadn't planned to speak "because it's too hard for me," she felt it was more important to say how "unfair" Price's killing had been "to our family.
Our family has always been positive and we always try to help people," she said.In an interview with PEOPLE in 2007, Serena said it was "still hard" for her to talk about.
Yetunde and I were so close; she changed my diapers," Serena said.
But I finally came to an acceptance of things.
She Meant a Lot to Us’Price, a nurse, mother of three and part owner of a modest hair salon, alsoworked as a personal assistantto Serena and Venus, keeping track of their appointments and the like, even joining them at Wimbledon.
But she also led a largely independent life in California.In an interview with PEOPLE in August 2003, shortly before she died, Price seemed to have no regrets about steering clear of the slipstream of her famous kin.
They're still my sisters," she said.
We don't get into the fame thing too much when we're all together as a family.
Price lived in a comfortable home in an upscale neighborhood in Corona.
According to locals, she doted on her three kids, two boys and a girl, all of whom were under the age of 12 when she was killed.
On the evening before the shooting, Price and her children visited with friends across the street.
She watched part of the Oscar De La Hoya boxing match before making sure the kids would be taken care of and heading off with Wormley on her fatal trip.Wormley told theL.A.
Timesthat he had been at a picnic, and she came to pick him up after he lost track of time that night.Jerritt Clark/GettyYears later, Price's spirit remains strong both in her family and the community where they grew up.
Serena and Venus opened theYetunde Price Resource Center, in Compton, in late 2016.
We definitely wanted to honor our sister's memory because she was a great sister; she was our oldest sister, and, obviously, she meant a lot to us," Serena said then,according to The Root.
And it meant a lot to us, to myself and to Venus and my other sisters as well, Isha and Lyndrea, that we've been wanting to do something for years in memory of her, especially the way it happened, a violent crime.
Basically, how does the family react?
If her kids didn't have my mom and us, it could be really devastating,"Serena said.
But we had such a great system that they're doing pretty good.
We just felt like people that didn't have that opportunity to fall back on; what could they do?
And that's kind of how this resource center came about.

Journalist Ian Crouch recently wrote a story for theNew Yorkerproclaiming Serena as America's greatest athlete.
Few dispute that the sisters are one of the most dynamic sibling duos in sports history.Yet perhaps even fewer know that the Williams sisters weren't the first African-American siblings to take tennis by storm.That distinction belongs to Margaret and Matilda Roumania Peters, sistersfrom Washington D.C.who wowed crowds with their spectacular doubles play in the 1930s, '40s and '50s.Nicknamed "Pete" and "Re-Pete," respectively, the Peters sisters played in theAmerican Tennis Association, a league formed to give African-Americans a chance to play competitive tennis at a national level.Established in 1916 and still alive today, the ATA is theoldest black sports organizationin the U.S.
Similar to the Negro Leagues in baseball, the ATA offered top black tennis players—who were denied access to all-white professional leagues—a stage to showcase their talents.The ATA sponsored tournaments throughout the country.
Although top players didn't make a living from these tournaments, they were indeed stars.
The Peters sisters were often asked to pose for publicity shots and sign autographs.
Crowds of blacks and whites traveled to watch them play.Video Play Button✨ Watch more top videos, highlights, and B/R original contentRight Arrow IconMargaret Peters, far left, poses with other African-American tennis players.Anonymous/Associated PressKnown fortheir slice serves, powerful backhands and quick chop shots, the Peters sisters became pseudo-celebrities.
Margaret (sometimes called "Big Pete") was the oldest by two years and the taller sister.
Matilda, (Re-Pete) was the younger, feistier sister.According toCecil Harris and Larryette Kyle-DeBose'sbookCharging the Net: A History of Blacks inTennis, actor and dancer Gene Kelly, stationed at a Navy Base near Washington D.C. during World War II, dropped in to watch the sisters play in 1944.
Kelly would also playtennis with the Peterssisters when he was in town.In a Jan. 10, 1942 edition of theAfro Americannewspaper, the "famous Peters sisters" made headlines for winning a fourth-consecutive doubles title.The sisters began playing tennis as young girls at a park across from their home in Georgetown.
They were recruited to play at Tuskegee University.
So close were they that Margaret waited for her sister to graduate high school so that they could enroll at Tuskegee together.Segregation and discrimination forced the ATA to hold most of its tournaments at historically black colleges and universities.
These tournaments became social events for affluent blacks.
Theannual national championshipswere highly anticipated and included parties, formal dances and fashion shows.The ATA operated in a parallel existence to the United States Lawn Tennis Association, now the USTA.
Before the 1950s, the USTA refused to allow blacks to compete against whites.
This included a talented young player named Althea Gibson who was making noise on the ATA Tour.Gibson, younger than the Peters sisters by nearly a decade, moved quickly up the ranks of theATA Tour.
She won the national championship in 1944 and 1945.
She suffered a loss in the finals in 1946 before winning 10 straight titles from 1947 to 1956.Serena and Venus Williams, seen here during the 2014 Rogers Cup, were not the first dynamic African-American sister act in tennis.Streeter Lecka/Getty ImagesThat loss was to Matilda "Re-Pete" Peters, the younger sister.
Matilda is the only African-American woman to ever defeat Gibson.Four years later, pressured by ATA officials and Alice Marble, Gibson was invited to compete in the U.S. National Championships, now the U.S. Open.
Already in her mid-20s, Gibson made her debut at Forest Lawn in 1950.
Two years later, George Stewart would become the first black man to play at the U.S. Open.Meanwhile, the Peters sisters, like so many other talented African-American tennis players, remained on the ATA tour.
They dominated the ATA, winning 14 doubles championships, a record that still remains.
Matilda also won two ATA singles titles.By the time color lines began to be broken, the sisters were in their 30s, about the age Venus and Serena Williams are now.
One's mid-30s are hardly the years to begin a professional tennis career.In 2003, the USTA, the same organization that denied African-Americans a chance to compete during most of the sisters' careers, honored the Peters duo with an achievement award during the Fed Cup quarterfinals in their hometown.The Peters sisters were also inducted into the USTA's Mid-Atlantic Section Hall of Fame in November 2003.They were inducted into the Black Tennis Hall of Fame in 2012.Matilda died of pneumonia in May 2003.Margaret diedin November 2004.It's hard to say how their games would have stacked up against those of Helen Wills Moody and Alice Marble.
It would have been nice to see.However, desegregation doors didn't swing wide open for African-American athletes.
As was the case with Jackie Robinson in Major League Baseball andNat "Sweetwater" Cliftonin the NBA, in the 1950s only a hand-picked, select few were given opportunities.Arthur Ashe Jr. and Althea Gibson, pictured here in 1988, were the first African-Americans to win Grand Slam titles.SUSAN RAGAN/Associated Press/Associated Press/Associated PressThat's why although they reached prominence in tennis decades before the Williams sisters, it seems odd to classify the Peters sisters as pioneers.
After all, they played tennis at Tuskegee, a university that had been offering tennis since the 1890s.Long after the Peters sisters retired from tennis, the ATA continued to attract top black players.
Lori McNeil, Chanda Rubin and Zina Garrisonall played in the ATA.
Garrison, aWimbledon finalist in 1990, won theATA singles titlesin 1979 and 1980 and the doubles titles in 1980 and 1981.Instead, consider the Peters sisters forgotten stars.
Their stories, buried beneath the weight of segregation, have existed all along.
Gibson, the first African-American to win a Grand Slam, is the pioneer.
The Peters sisters, like several talented African-American baseball players who made Negro League All-Star teams that left Robinson off, were simply the unlucky uninvited.They lacked an invitation, not talent.
Those who watched them compete witnessed two dynamic and athletic tennis superstars.
Even as they accumulate posthumous accolades, their unearthed stories shine a light on misplaced tennis gems.Facebook LogoTwitter LogoCopy Link IconBleacher Report LogoFacebook LogoTwitter LogoInstagram LogoAboutAdvertiseContact UsGet HelpCareersCommunity GuidelinesPrivacyDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTerms Of UseAdChoicesCopyright © 2023 Bleacher Report, Inc.

Why Serena Williams' Heroes in Life 'Changed' After MotherhoodSkip to main contentAdvertisementShowbiz Cheat SheetExpand SearchCollapse SearchSearch for:SearchMenuEntertainmentExclusivesTVWhat to WatchCelebrityRoyal familyMusicMoviesFollowInstagramYoutubeFacebookTwitterAbout UsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyWeb AccessibilitySportscastingEndgame360MotorBiscuitEntertainmentExclusivesTVWhat to WatchCelebrityRoyal familyMusicMoviesSwipeHome/CelebrityWhy Serena Williams’ Heroes in Life ‘Changed’ After MotherhoodbyGreg Brian|More Articles: CelebrityPublished onFebruary 24, 2020Share:Being a tennis superstarand a mom at the same time is more than a Herculean task, even if that metaphor has a male connotation.
For a woman, it’s not usually recognized enough when dealing with a busy career and having children.It had to takeSerena Williams to broach the subjectand make it clear how big of a job this is.
When interviewed recently by Anna Wintour during New York Fashion Week, Williams gave a shoutout to women who’ve had kids.Being a mother herself now, she notes the heroes she once worshiped changed from the typical.Who does she look up to now?
For those who support the direction of women in the world and realize how much they’ve gone through, Williams’ comments were more than a little refreshing.Serena Williams’ heroes are no longer sports iconsSerena Williams | Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for GlamourNo doubt most of Williams’ heroes before becoming a mother were women who happened to be tennis greats.
How could shenot be influenced by tennis legendslike Ora Washington, Althea Gibson, or Zina Garrison?
These African-American women changed the game of tennis forever by breaking near impossible racial barriers.Once Williams became a mother in 2017, her opinions shifted on who were the real heroes of the world.
She told Wintour above that mothers, in general, became her personal heroes.
This is mostly because they still go unsung on how much they have to deal with to keep going.There was a clear distinction made between working mothers and those who can afford to take time off.
Williams noted the disparity, hence her heroes being the women who don’t have the luxury to take maternity leave from their jobs.
Those who have to go back to a 9 to 5 job after having a child face the most grueling schedule anyone can have.Recognizing mothers who have to leave their children to maintain a careerSerena Williams has found a new fan base in working mothers everywhere.
Our ed-at-large@jamilarizvisums it up with a poignant love letter.
Paywall.
https://t.co/n8FYYWC1LW— futurewomen (@FutureWomen)August 3, 2018One thing Williams noted about all working mothers is mosthave to leave their childrenduring the day (or sometimes longer) to keep their jobs going.
Anyone who’s grown up at daycare centers or with a nanny knows what it’s like to have to be away from their moms for a full day, if not longer.Some mothers haven’t had a chance to spend any quality time with their kids until they retire.
That seems cruelly unfair when thought about a little deeper.No doubt many fans of Williams find it eye-opening to see her understand what it’s like for middle-class families in a time when wealth in sports divides from reality.
Regardless, she does understand what it’s like to have to be away from her own daughter.Will working moms finally be recognized more in a time when it’s challenging for working moms to enjoy paid maternity leave in every state?Serena Williams could become an advocate for more laws in helping working momsIn many countries paid maternity leave is required by law: Switzerland (8 weeks); Mexico (12 weeks); France (19  weeks); South Korea (25 weeks); Sweden 35 weeks); Estonia (85 weeks ).
Not in US where the number is 0 (zero).
Great" economy?
Family values?https://t.co/VYWfIhKpVc— Richard D. Wolff (@profwolff)February 10, 2020Thus far, the federalFamily and Medical Leave Actonly provide 12 weeks of time off without pay to the mother.
Many have tried to stand up for a more fair bill in providing a paid maternity leave scenario for America’s moms.Only four states in the U.S. offer paid maternity leave, with New York recently joining the fray.
Let’s hope Serena Williams will fight for more measures like this after opening up about her support of working mothers.Considering even her sister, Venus, is in awe of Serena and in how she’s working as a mom, it’s clear the latter has become her own hero.
From all indications, she intends to make sure more women in similar situations are recognized more often afterjoining The Mom Project.Tags:celebritiesSerena WilliamsInstagramYoutubeFacebookTwitterAbout UsContact UsCareersEthicsFact checking commitmentCorrections commitmentOwnership funding advertising infoSportscastingEndgame360MotorBiscuit© Copyright 2023 Endgame360 Inc.

Most-named childhood hero in ESPN The Magazine's not-so-scientific survey of professional athletes.Steve Freeman/NBAE/Getty ImagesFacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmailJun 20, 2019StaffFacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerPinterestEmailprintEveryone's got a favorite athlete growing up -- the one whose jerseys we buy, whose highlights we replay over and over, who we imagine ourselves being while we practice on the court or in the backyard.
And, it turns out, those athletes who are idols in their own rightat this very momenthad their own guiding stars when they were growing up.
So we asked more than 100 of today's biggest pro athletes who they looked up to when they were youngsters.
I loved thatLisa Lesliewas really tall and skinny like me.
I played basketball as a kid, and I loved how she carried herself.
She had this great feminine quality, but she was also so fierce as an athlete and very competitive, and I loved that about her.
So thank you, Lisa Leslie, for being so awesome."
Monica Abbott(Team USA softball pitcher)Lisa Leslie(Eight-time WNBA All-Star)Davante Adams(Green Bay Packerswide receiver)Michael Vick(Four-time Pro Bowl quarterback)"My foster mom was a personal trainer atSitiveni Sivivatu's gym.
For my birthday she got his rugby shorts for me, which was nice.
And he signed them.
So I figured these were new.
I, like, put 'em to my face, bro.
And she was like, 'Bro, those are dirty,' and I was like, 'Oh, is that what that is?
It f---ing smells, man.'
It was pretty bad."

It is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever cost”(Ashe).
Arthur Ashe, a legendary tennis player, believed that heroes have an urge to serve, not to surpass.
Heroes are those who strive to help others, yet continue to manage their own happiness and health.
A hero can be defined as a person who donates any amount of money to charity, a teen who walks an elder’s dog free of charge, or anybody who helps out in their community.
David Granger speaks about how heroes always come through to inspire society: “Heroes arrive when we need them most.
They define us and point us in a direction.
To turn our sights at this moment toward an idea of America that is heroic does, admittedly, require an act of will”(Granger).
What singles a hero out from any other average being is how many barriers he/she is willing to break in order to aid those in need.
Furthermore, in order to maintain positivity and give back to society, a hero must be generous, determined, and strong--both mentally and physically.
These traits benefit not only the hero himself but also those that he/she helps.
Generosity and strength are the two main traits a hero must possess in order to succeed.Serena Williams in 1992Ken LevineOf all the people who possess these traits, famous tennis player Serena Jameka Williams surpasses the ideals of a hero.
Williams has broken many records and won many tournaments that have shaped her career.
So far, she has taken home 72 wins on the WTA tour, she has earned $84,463,131 in career prize money, and she has nearly doubled that amount earned in endorsements and appearance fees.
That is how many wins and how much hard work it takes to become, and to hold the ranking for #1 women’s tennis player in the world.
On her sixth occasion, Williams held the number one spot for 186 consecutive weeks.
Throughout her career, her name has been at first place for a total of 319 weeks.
Born on September 26, 1981, Serena Williams was introduced to the sport of tennis at a very young age, along with her four older sisters.
She was only three years old when her parents decided to put them on the court.
Their parents, Richard Williams and Oracene Price, taught themselves how to play the sport because they knew that tennis was their ticket out of the slums of Compton, CA.
Richard and Oracene had their thoughts straight because they were correct; by the time Williams reached age 9, the Williams family relocated to Florida to play better tennis.
When Williams started getting more skilled, and once her name was known in the junior tennis circuit, her professional career took off just years later.
Age 17.
1999.
The year when Williams won her first Grand Slam singles title at the U.S. Open.
It was a massive win for her.
That win is what ignited her forever-burning flame of success.
Unfortunately, only four years later, Yetunde Price (Williams’ eldest sister) was shot and killed back in Compton.
The bullet was meant to reach her boyfriend at the time, but sadly it hit Yetunde instead.
It was a major devastation to the family, and also a setback on Williams’ career.
It impacted Williams’ mindset, to the point where depression was something on her mind.
Through her strength, even depression is something that she was able to battle and overcome.
World-renowned tennis player, Serena Williams, utilized her strength and determination to defy society’s norms of a standard athlete, thus shaping her into the generous, iconic woman that she is today.2008 U.S. Open win, showing off those muscles!Timothy A. ClarySerena Williams and her trophy from the Australian open, won while pregnantMartin RichardThrough physical and mental strength, Williams thrives both on and off the court, even in the toughest of times.
During an interview, Bissinger questioned Williams about how she felt going into the Australian Open while carrying an eight-week-old fetus: “The Australian Open was about to begin, and an immediate medical determination had to be made on what risk there might be in playing.
The doctor who examined her thought she was about three or four weeks pregnant—it was almost impossibly hard to tell because the fetus was so small—and said there was no risk whatsoever.
When Williams returned to the States and had a subsequent exam, it was discovered that she had actually been more advanced, about seven to eight weeks, but she said she still would have played”(Bissinger).
Williams’ ability to play all seven matches in the tournament, and win them all in straight sets, all with the stresses and physical impact clearly shows how tenacious of a woman she really is.
The fact that Williams said that she would have played even if she knew that she was seven to eight weeks pregnant shows that she is a risk-taker, which ultimately shows her mental strength.
Williams’ obstacles, whether small or large, do not stop her use of her impeccable strength to push through, even in the most excruciatingly painful times.
Her physical strength is not the only thing that carried her through, but her determined mentality plays an important role in her success.
Tennis can be strenuous on the mind, but the right mindset can keep you going: During the same interview, Bissinger inquired about her mentality during the game: “Serena plays a sport that requires the mental focus of instantaneously letting go of losing points and moving on because there are a lot of excruciating ones no matter how great you are, continual regrouping and re-inventing: dwell on them, you lose confidence; lose confidence and you lose.
She is also superbly conditioned, given that a female tennis player may run about three miles in a match without the luxury of coming out of the game because you feel winded or lost too much money gambling with teammates the night before on the charter and would rather mope on the bench” (Bissinger).
The phrase, “lose confidence and you lose” states that confidence is a key factor in a player’s mindset if they hope to emerge victorious.
Williams’ immaculate “winner’s mentality” and her ability to correct her mistakes in a match is one of the essential reasons of why she is so prosperous in tennis.
Her confidence and determination as a female tennis player results in her investing time and work into her game, especially after tournaments.
There is no room for her to skip practicing, especially during tournament season, because of her extreme focus on her game plan.
Williams’ powerful strength carried her to become an incredibly generous woman.Venus and Serena Williams at YPRC launchunknownBy donating thousands and thousands of dollars to many different charities that support different causes, Williams satisfied her need of giving back those who are less fortunate than herself.
Williams shows hospitality when she provides resources to the unprivileged: “I know first-hand the devastating effects violence has on loved ones…the pain and grief often feels unbearable.
This is why I launched the Yetunde Price Resource Center (YPRC), to provide comprehensive resource, referral and case management services to individuals and families affected by community violence.
I want to help others gain access to the tools they need to cope, heal and move forward in life”  (Serena Williams).
Once the financial resources were available, she founded the YPRC to provide a resource for society, one that she did not have when Yetunde was killed.
Compton, CA is not the safest place for a family to be living, so she knows how difficult it is for families in her neighborhood to cope with the passing of a loved family member.
One of Williams’ many funds, the YPRC, protects and provides for families involved with community violence.
The Williams family not only helps their hometown of Compton but also contributes worldwide: “Through UNICEF, we got involved in a program that distributed bed nets to help cut down on the spread of malaria” (Williams 181).
Williams, her mother, and sister Isha, all took a trip to different countries in Africa.
There, they contributed to the poor areas by building schools for children that are free to attend.
They also hosted clinics to teach tennis to the children.
Since 2011, Williams is an ambassador for UNICEF, and through them, she helped a poor area in Africa get access to vaccines for malaria to contribute to slowing down the spread of the disease.
The amount of money that she has put into these charities and has given to those in need is legendary; what is incredible is the heart that she has in order to do these kind things for society.QuoteNikeThrough utilizing her immense strength and determination, world-renowned tennis player, Serena Williams defied society’s norms of a standard athlete, which shaped her into the generous, iconic woman that she is today.
Williams’ incredible mental power provides her with a way to break through the toughest emotional times.
Her physical strength allows her to play tennis, even with the biggest obstacles--like pregnancy.
She has also donated thousands and thousands of dollars to many different charities, and has started multiple funds to help those in need.
Serena Williams is an inspirational figure, who is shaped by her struggles of successfully emerging out of her hometown.
Through all the bumps in the road, she always ends with a positive mindset and her head up high: “I’ve never been the right kind of woman.
Oversized, and overconfident.
Too mean if I don’t smile.
Too black for my tennis whites.
Too motivated for motherhood.
But I’m proving.
Time and time again.
There’s no wrong way to be a woman”(Instagram) shows the boundaries she has pushed, and all of society’s rules that she has broken.
Even today, she is still breaking limits as a famous black female tennis player from Compton, California.
Personally, Serena Williams inspires me primarily through her strength.
Through the undesirable moments of mental distress, I tend to reflect on how Williams defeated many of her own emotional battles.
The struggles associated with my shoulder injury allow me to relate to her physical power as well.
Furthermore, what makes me feel like I can conquer any conflict, on and off the court, is how she managed to end the Australian Open with an iconic win.
Her impressive positivity always succeeds to uplift my spirit.
Williams has never been the type of woman to flaunt her success upon others; she is humble about her wins and accepting of her losses--which is something to be proud of.
Just as Arthur Ashe stated, heroes are defined by their urge to serve, not to surpass.
By her humble and generous qualities of helping out not only her hometown, but also many nations of Africa, Serena Williams fits the definition of a true heroic woman.Works CitedAshe, Arthur.

Stephens, 19, beats Serena Williams in Australian OpenNewsSportsEntertainmentLifestyleOpinionAdvertiseObituarieseNewspaperLegalsSubscribeSPORTSStephens, 19, beats Serena Williams in Australian OpenJohn PyeAssociated PressMELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - Sloane Stephens wiped away tears as she thought about hanging a poster of herself on a wall in the place of her childhood hero.The 19-year-old American seemed barely able to compute how she'd produced the upset of the Australian Open by beating 15-time major winner Serena Williams in the quarterfinals Wednesday.
It was her first trip that far in seven Grand Slam tournaments.A poster of Williams had adorned the wall on Stephens' bedroom as a child.
Now, in her view, they're peers.
This is so crazy," Stephens said in a post-match TV interview after rallying from a set and a break down against an injured and angry Williams.The 29th-seeded Stephens won 3-6, 7-5, 6-4.
She calmed the nerves and started swinging harder and lifting her tempo at 4-3 in the second.That's when Williams jarred her back trying to pull up before the net as she chased down a drop shot.
Williams let out a loud scream and hopped away.
Stephens had a look back over the net, seemingly in concern.Williams later called for the trainer between games.
She had a three-minute medical timeout and came back serving at a pace well below her usual speed.
You think of worst-case scenarios.
You know, I just thought, OK, just pretend nothing's wrong and just try your best," she said.Stephens had practiced with Williams for the Fed Cup, but had played her only once, a straight sets loss at the Brisbane International earlier this month.
Brisbane helped me because I got the first time we played out of the way," she said.
First time is always tough.
Definitely I was glad that I got it there.
It helped me raise my level.

She fell to fellow American Annie Miller.ByJohn BerkokPublished Oct 28, 2020copy_linkAdvertisingOne of the greatest careers in tennis history began on this day exactly 25 years ago—October 28, 1995—as Serena Williams played a qualifying match in Quebec City.It was a Saturday, and Serena was just 14 at the time.
Her opponent, fellow American Annie Miller, was still relatively new on the scene herself.
The 149th-ranked 18-year-old had just turned pro that year.The match was over in less than an hour, with Miller winning, 6-1, 6-1.“I didn’t play like I meant to play,” Serena said that day.
I played kind of like an amateur.”“She has as much power as anybody around,” Miller said after the match, “but maybe she needs to play some junior events the way Anna Kournikova has, to learn how to become match tough.”Kournikova, incidentally, was in the same qualifying draw, winning a round but losing her second.But back to Serena’s first taste of pro tennis—it’s a match she hasn’t forgotten.“All I remember is that I was incredibly nervous,” she said in Toronto in 2019.
I couldn’t believe I was playing.
I just couldn’t deal with the nerves.
It was a lot for me.
I just needed to go home and get a lot better, and then when I came back, I was more ready to be able to play on the professional circuit.”Serena didn’t play again until 1997, but she stayed true to her word.
She came back better than ever, her breakthrough tournament coming as a 304th-ranked wild card in Chicago in November 1997, when she beat No.

There were no spotlights, no introductions, not even any fans.
Her court was set a level below a smoky lounge that held a bar, a big-screen television, an ice cream cart and 50 or so onlookers with varying stages of interest in her fate.”“I thought that was just another day at the tennis courts, but little did I know that over 20 years later it’s sort of become the thing that people like to talk about when they ask me about tennis,” Miller said in 2018.
But I’m proud to say that I played Serena and I’m of course in awe of everything she’s achieved, and what she’s done for the sport and for kids, and for everyone around the world.”And since then, Serena has played some of her very best tennis in Canada, winning the Rogers Cup three times—all in Toronto—in 2001, 2011 and 2013.
She’s reached the semifinals or better in eight of nine appearances at the event, including two more finals in 2000 (in Montreal) and 2019 (in Toronto).She never played in Quebec City again, though.TV SchedulePressSales media kitCareersAboutContact usPrivacy PolicyTerms & ConditionsAll rights reserved.© 2023VISUAL STORIESLIVE BLOGALBUMDOCUMENTDOWNLOADLATEST DOCUMENTSFULLSCREENFULLSCREEN WHITEGRAND SLAM LOGOSPINNERInfoBallWinnerTennis Channel LogoTennis Channel Plus Logo

It's been such a remarkable career—to see how she changed the game.
Williams, whose historic career includes 23 Grand Slam titles,said this monthin a cover story forVoguethat she's "evolving away from tennis toward other things that are important to me," including spending time with her husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, and their young daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr.However, Williams's retirement plans are on hold for the moment: she's currently powering her way through the U.S. Open.
She beat Danka Kovinic in her first round on Monday night, then stunned No.
2 world seed Anett Kontaveit on Wednesday, which means she'll move into the third round of the tournament on Friday.
Tonight, she'll also play a doubles match with her older sister (and fellow tennis star) Venus.We'll be watching it all—and we love knowing there's a little piece of Bradenton on the court with her.Filed underTennis,IMG AcademiesShareShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare via EmailShare on RedditShow CommentsRelated ContentThe IMG EffectEvery Year, Elite College Football Players Descend on IMG Academy04/01/2020ByDavid HackettHome of a LegendInside Tennis Legend Nick Bollettieri's Bradenton Home03/01/2021ByRobert PlunketRIPThe Tennis World Reacts to the Death of Nick Bollettieri12/05/2022ByKim DoleattoLove AllThe Sarasota Open Is Upping the Ante This Year01/31/2023ByIsaac Eger1255 N.

Outside, paparazzi are ensconced across the street hoping to catch a glimpse of the tennis superstar, and vendors are quickly working to build the French ball–themed,Beauty and the Beast–style decor, complete with a gold arch of flowers at the end of the aisle, long tables covered in lamé fabric, and lots of surprises.
Inside, Serena is a calm, cool, and confident bride, dressed in leggings and a black baseball cap, just trying to nail her steps for when she and her husband take their first spin on the dance floor to “Tale as Old as Time” tomorrow.Some might say that just like the protagonists in Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve’s fairy tale, Serena and Alexis are an unlikely match from two very different worlds.
She’s the greatest female athlete ever, arguably the greatest athlete of all time.
No man has ever taken home a title pregnant!
Enough said.)
Meanwhile, he’s the founder ofReddit(the birthplace of many a meme), a guy who grew up playing Game Boy, and has been referred to as the “mayor of the Internet.” When they met, she’d never heard of Reddit, and he had never watched a single one of her matches.
But, as we all know, opposites attract.It all started in Rome with a meet-cute worthy of a romantic comedy.
Despite being notoriously disciplined, Serena isnot a morning person.
But she’d heard good things about the epic breakfast at the Cavalieri Hotel, where she was staying for the Italian Open, so she got out of bed early and went with a few members from her team to check it out.
They arrived at the buffet only to find that it had closed just five minutes earlier, so instead, they grabbed a table by the pool and ordered à la carte.
Alexis was speaking at a conference and staying at the same hotel.
That morning, he had also made his way down early to indulge in the buffet he’d heard so much about.
When he, too, discovered that it was no longer open, he took a seat at a table next to Serena’s with the intention of ordering food and doing work on his laptop.Frustrated that an interloper was encroaching upon their space, Serena’s friend Zane started teasing Alexis, saying there was a rat at his table and that he should move.
I was so annoyed that he’d sat down next to me,” remembers Serena.
There were so many empty tables!” Undeterred by the frosty reception he seemed to be receiving, Alexis jokingly responded saying that he was from Brooklyn—he’d seen lots of rats, and they didn’t bother him.
Serena started cracking up and asked him to join her group.
He obliged but was still a little unsure whether the person with whom he suddenly found himself having breakfast was actuallytheSerena Williams.You see, Alexis didn’t follow tennis at all.
The first time he went to watch Serena play he infamously Instagrammed a photo of her foot faulting.
But no matter.
The two hit it off.
That first time she asked him to come see her in the Paris Open, he knew it was a bit far-flung but he thought,What’s the worst that could happen?
I know people in Paris, so if it doesn’t work out, I’ll have a great story to tell my friends about that time I almost hung out with Serena Williams.Serena appreciated his happy-go-lucky approach to life, and their first date involved simply meandering around theCity of Lightwith no destination to speak of, something the always-scheduled, always-surrounded athlete almost never gets to do.Fast-forward 18 months later and the Internet entrepreneur was proposing to the superstar.
I came home one day to find my bags already packed for me, and I had absolutely no idea where I was going until I got on the flight,” Serena admits.
Alexis flew me out to Rome, back to the exact table where we’d met.
We were both really nervous but also excited to take this huge step.
It was such a beautiful moment.” Ever the jokester, in addition to having the hotel cleared and flowers everywhere, Alexis had placed a small plastic rat on the table.
Serena announced her happy news by postinga sweet poemon Reddit.In September, Serena gave birth to the couple’s first child, Alexis “Olympia” Ohanian,  Jr., and the two parents are absolutely besotted with their now 2-month-old daughter.
The baby, who already has more than 105,000 Instagram followers, was present for the ceremony last night and looked on as her mom and dad tied the knot among 200 family and friends in the Big Easy.“Alexis really wanted to do New Orleans,” explains Serena.
It’s his favorite city besides Brooklyn.
It’s got a heavy European influence; it’s fun and has amazing food.
He just loves the vibe.
The venue—theContemporary Arts Center of New Orleans—was a decision we both made.
Painting and art is something I’m really passionate about, so it just felt natural and different to do it at a contemporary art museum.”Most PopularFashionThe Sheer Power of Transparent ClothingByHannah JacksonRoyalsThe Princess of Wales Breaks Royal Tradition With a Bold Easter ManicureBySilvia LópezCelebrity StyleKaia Gerber Steps Out In the Breakout Sneakers of SummerByChristian AllaireThe two chose November 16 as their wedding date in memory of Alexis’s mother, who passed away nine years ago.
It is her birthday, and we wanted her to be represented at the wedding,” says Serena.
Obviously, we wish that she could be here for this, but choosing her birthday as our wedding date was a nice way of making sure she’s still involved and made us feel more connected to her on our day.”Once they’d settled on a date and a place, they hired their wedding planner.
I knew early on that I wanted to work with someone on the East Coast, and Jennifer [Zabinski] felt fresh and new, but also has a lot of experience in planning and is organized and thorough,” explains Serena.
When Jennifer first met with the bride, the tennis champ wasn’t quite ready to get into specifics, so the two discussed their mutual love of dogs instead.
I think she had to feel comfortable with getting to know me and me getting to know her,” Jennifer says.
There’s so much there in terms of her vision.
She’s actually an amazing planner herself, and the running joke now is that she’s going to be my intern.”“The whole process was so smooth!” Serena adds.
Communication is really important to me, and Jennifer and her team were always great at giving updates and keeping things moving consistently.”Similarly, Serena’s dress search was the stuff wedding dreams are made of—she worked with Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen.
I flew to London to meet with Sarah and ended up falling in love with the ball gown silhouette, which is completely the opposite of what I ever thought I would choose for myself,” Serena says.
I loved the idea of doing a really spectacular ball gown, and it has turned out to be such an incredibly special piece.”At 5:15 p.m., guests including Beyoncé and her mother, Tina Knowles; Kelly Rowland;Kim Kardashian West; Anna Wintour; Ciara; and La La Anthony arrived for cocktails before taking their seats in the ceremony space.
There, everyone watched a short video that told the story of Serena and Alexis’s relationship on TVs encased in gold frames above the aisle.
The seating had a fashion-show feel: “I wanted the whole thing to be as nontraditional as possible,” explains Serena.
We did sofas instead of chairs, with everything facing the aisle instead of the altar.”Most PopularFashionThe Sheer Power of Transparent ClothingByHannah JacksonRoyalsThe Princess of Wales Breaks Royal Tradition With a Bold Easter ManicureBySilvia LópezCelebrity StyleKaia Gerber Steps Out In the Breakout Sneakers of SummerByChristian AllaireBridesmaids made their entrances to rounds of applause wearing custom Galia Lahav dresses.
Before the ceremony, Serena’s best friend, Val Vogt, toldVogue: “She talked to all of us and just kind of let us have creative control as to what dress fit our personality.
And then she approved it, of course!” Val carried the bride’s beloved Yorkshire terrier, Chip, down the aisle in his very own tiny tuxedo.Then, with all eyes on her, Serena emerged in a dramatic strapless, belted Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen princess gown with a cape, carrying a bouquet of white roses and sparkling with jewelry by XIV Karats, worth $3.5 million in total.
Alexis, in an Armani suit, was smiling from ear to ear as Serena slowly walked up the aisle to join him.
The couple wrote their own vows.
Alexis’s called Serena his queen and said that they already have their princess.
With a bold, confident voice, he talked about how she takes such good care of everyone in her life, and now he wants to spend the rest of his life taking care of her.
His words led to laughter at the start—“I will always have bad jokes that make your eyes roll, make you give me the side eye”—but by the end, everyone was crying happy tears: “You are the greatest of all time, not just in sport,” he told Serena.
I’m talking about as a mother and as a wife.
I am so excited to write so many more chapters of our fairy tale together.
And my whole life I didn’t even realize it, but I was waiting for this moment.
And everything that I have done, everything that I am so proud of in my career, and in my life, for the last 34 years, pales in comparison to what we’re doing today.
And I am so grateful, and I am so in love.”After the couple was pronounced husband and wife, cheers erupted and guests made their way out onto the street for cocktails while the bride and groom took their formal family portraits in the Arts Center’s Black Box Theatre.
During cocktails, Kardashian West toldVogue,  “I’ve known Serena for so long and am so happy she’s found her prince.
From the moment she told me she met Alexis in Rome, it was like .
. . she’s been so happy and has this light about her that is so special to see.
You just know it is so real.
He makes her so happy and that just makes her friends happy.”Most PopularFashionThe Sheer Power of Transparent ClothingByHannah JacksonRoyalsThe Princess of Wales Breaks Royal Tradition With a Bold Easter ManicureBySilvia LópezCelebrity StyleKaia Gerber Steps Out In the Breakout Sneakers of SummerByChristian AllaireA second line parade then led everyone back inside where the band was playing “Be Our Guest” and an around-the-world-themed dinner byCreative Edge Partieswas served.
As guests found their seats at four long tables named after Serena’s Grand Slam wins, the newlyweds were introduced as Mr. and Mrs. Alexis Ohanian, and Serena debuted her second dress of the evening, a dramatic beaded, feathered Versace moment that made her look like a fashion-forward superwoman.
It took a team of five embroiderers to create the dress, Donatella Versace toldVogue.
They “worked nonstop to make sure the tiniest details were perfectly taken care of, for a total of 1,500 hours.” The newlyweds sat in gold throne-like chairs that looked like they were made for a king and queen.
The whole fairy-tale idea came to us early on,” says Jennifer.
Serena’s very girly.
She was like, ‘I love Disney, how can we incorporate it in?’ Then Serena and Alexis said, ‘What do you think about a royal ball?’ Serena was like, ‘I just want it to be opulent.
I want it to be like a fairy tale.’ ” Southern, Armenian (a nod to Alexis’s heritage), and Italian food, as well as a “steak house” station and a salad wall, were all available on offer.
Serena wanted a ball, but she wanted a modern ball, not anything that was too stuffy,” saysPreston Bailey, the man behind all of the decor.
For the flowers and overall aesthetic, she wanted something that was very different and unique.” Chandeliers encased in gold birdcages, trophy-style place cards, and the “black lamé” table linens achieved this goal.Following dinner, Alexis took the stage and asked the guests, who had been dancing to theÉlan Artists’s band, to clear the floor.
This is the only time I’ll ask you to do this all night, but I need for you to get off the dance floor,” he said, laughing.
This is the first time I get to introduce Serena Williams as my wife.
Come out, wifey!” Serena appeared in her third dress of the evening: a stunning fitted Versace look with a short skirt.
She joined Alexis on the dance floor and the band started playing “Tale as Old as Time,” which then segued into “If I Can’t Have You.” There were spins, twists, and lifts, to lots of cheers—the two totally nailed every step.Most PopularFashionThe Sheer Power of Transparent ClothingByHannah JacksonRoyalsThe Princess of Wales Breaks Royal Tradition With a Bold Easter ManicureBySilvia LópezCelebrity StyleKaia Gerber Steps Out In the Breakout Sneakers of SummerByChristian AllaireGuests then joined the couple for more dancing before moving into the next room for a surprise performance by New Edition.
The band called the couple up onstage, where Serena and Alexis nailed yet another dance routine with the guys as Beyoncé, Kelly, and Ciara cheered them on.Curtains then opened, and everyone relocated back to where the ceremony had taken place—Preston’s team had completely transformed the space into a chic lounge for the after-party.
DJ Mike Wise was on the turntables playing lots of old-school ’90s rap.
At about 1:30 a.m., Alexis grabbed the mic to reveal the final surprise of the evening for his new bride.
People told him it couldn’t be done, he said.
But, when people say no to Alexis in his business or personal life, he always accepts the challenge.
Just then, a curtain dropped, revealing an illuminated, all-white carousel.
Serena screamed with excitement, and guests jumped up on horses while Ginuwine’s “Pony” played in the background.
The newlyweds cuddled on a bench while everyone partied on the carousel as it spun—a picture-perfect scene to end a fantastical night.TopicsSerena WilliamsVogue WeddingsAn all-access invitation to the exceptional and inspirational, plus planning tips and advice.Sign Up NowBy signing up you agree to ourUser AgreementandPrivacy Policy & Cookie Statement.Read MoreWeddingsThe Cutest Celebrity Engagement Stories to Lift Your SpiritsByElise TaylorCelebrity Style“This Was a Really Significant Moment for Me”: The Story Behind Jodie Comer’s “Strong, Confident” Olivier Awards GownByAlice CaryShoppingNeed to Know Now: TheVogueJewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsByCharlotte DiamondRunwayIn Their Own Words: 35 Designers on the Fall 2023 SeasonByLaird Borrelli-PerssonFashionLila Moss on Her Personal Style, Perfecting Her Runway Walk, and the One Thing She Can’t Steal from Her Mother’s ClosetRoyalsA New Exhibition at Kensington Palace Charts Regal Style on the Red CarpetByAlice CaryThe latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.FacebookTwitterPinterestInstagramTiktokMore from VogueNewsletterCustomer CareVerify SubscriptionContact usAbout VogueCareersSee More StoriesFashionBeautyCultureLivingRunwayShoppingMagazineAccessibility HelpMastheadVisual StoriesCondé Nast SpotlightDo Not Sell My Personal Info©2023Condé Nast.

Alexis will have a babysitter on hand just for her the entire night,' the source told DailyMail.com.
Both parents wouldn't dream of not having her there.
She will be a part of the wedding as much as possible for an 11-week-old.
They are totally and utterly besotted with her.
Wedding eve: 'Serena and Alexis have spared no expense on their dream wedding,' a source told DailyMail.com of the $1 million nuptialsAir it out: 'They have hired the best of the best and can't wait to get married in The Big Easy.
It's a special city for Serena and somewhere she has always loved,' said the sourceFull house: There will be approximately 250 guests at the ceremony on ThursdaySmart choice: 'Serena and Alexis chose the Contemporary Arts Center because of its incredible architecture and historyKeeping track: 'Alexis will have a babysitter on hand just for her the entire night,' the source told DailyMail.com.Serena celebrated becoming a new mom back in September by posting a photo of her daughter resting on her shoulder to Instagram, writing: 'Meet Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. You have to check out link in bio for her amazing journey.
Also check out my IG stories.
She had guessed that she was having a girl in an interview withVoguethat ran in the magazine's September issue.
Alexis thinks we’re having a boy, but I have a strong suspicion that it’s a girl,' said Serena.
Two weeks after we found out, I played theAustralian Open.
I told Alexis it has to be a girl because there I was playing in 100-degree weather, and that baby never gave me any trouble.
Ride or die.
Women are tough that way.
Few are tougher than Serena, however, which is why it was a bit of a surprise to hear her say that she was 'nervous about childbirth' in that same interview.
I’m not a spring chicken.
The one thing I really want is an epidural, which I know a lot of people are against, but I’ve had surgeries galore, and I don’t need to experience any more pain if I can avoid it,' said Serena.
But the biggest thing is that I don’t really think I’m a baby person.
Not yet.
That’s something I have to work on.
I’m so used to me-me-me, taking care of my health, my body, my career.
I always ask, Am I going to be good enough?
Serena will be back in action next month, which even she realizes is a bit unreal.
It’s the most outrageous plan,' said Serena.
I just want to put that out there.
That’s, like, three months after I give birth.
I’m not walking anything back, but I’m just saying it’s pretty intense.
She then revealed her fear of fading away, something that could never happen given her complete dominance in the sport.
In this game you can go dark fast.
If I lose, and I lose again, it’s like, she’s done.
Especially since I’m not 20 years old,' said Serena.
I’ll tell you this much: I won’t win less.
Either I win, or I don’t play.
Serena signed an exclusive deal with her friend Anna Wintour to feature pictures from the event exclusively in VogueThere will be approximately 250 guests at the ceremony, and it seems that the most important lady in Williams and Ohanian's life will be playing a very big part in the ceremonyAmong those who will be on hand is Serena's best friend Colton Haynes, who was spotted arriving in New Orleans on Tuesday night'Both parents wouldn't dream of not having her there.
They are totally and utterly besotted with her,' added the sourceWilliams and Ohanian announced their engagement just a few weeks before the big pregnancy news.He did this by whisking her off to Rome, where the two had met after a chance encounter at their hotel two years prior.The pair later detailed their romance in an interview withVanity Fair, which began when Ohanian refused to move from a table Serena had wanted to use for her group while they ate breakfast.Williams shared the news on Reddit by posting a poem, writing: 'At the same table we first met by chance / This time he made it not by chance / But by choice / Down on one knee / He said 4 words / And I said yes.
Ohanian, 33, later posted Williams' poem to his Facebook account, writing: 'She said yes.
He also commented on her poem on Reddit, writing: 'And you made me the happiest man on the planet.
At the time the two did not realize that Serena was pregnant, and she initially refused to even take a pregnancy test when her friend recommended it just three days before the start of the Australian Open last January.The test was positive.
As were the five subsequent ones she took that night.Serena's initial response was shock and concern as to how she was going to be able to play starting Monday, and win Wimbledon in July, which she said had been her big goal for the the year.That first hurdle proved to be no real challenger for Serena, who spent the following two weeks handily dispatching of each and every competitor she faced down in Melbourne - ending with a win in the finals over her sister Venus.Serena's older sister was one of the few who knew she was pregnant at that time, with Serena keeping the news private for weeks.It's lit: Alexis Ohanian was photographed on his hotel balcony puffing on a funny cigarette Tuesday night (above)Primped and pampered: He got a manicure earlier in the day ahead of his wedding to certified nail technician Serena WilliamsBeer me, bro: The 34-year-old Reddit founder partied in the French Quarter on Tuesday night with a group of friends and his fatherFeline crazy: Ohanian was spotted heading into the karaoke bar Cat's Meow (above) and grabbing some grub at Frankie & Johnny'sDad and me: Ohanian and his father both had big grins on their faces ahead of the big wedding day (above)She finally revealed her baby joy on social media back in April when she was 20 weeks pregnant.She made her return to Twitter a week after giving birth, when the greatest female tennis player of all time made a point of congratulating this year's US Open finalists.
There are NO words to describe how proud and how happy I am for @Madison_keys and @SloaneStephens for making the US open finals,' wrote Serena about the two young, black Americans who were competing for the title in New York.
These amazing women continue to change the game and bring excellence, power, finesse and change to tennis.
She then added: 'What a joy it will be to watch this- hopefully first of many finals.
Let's go ladies!
Serena sent out her love and encouragement despite the fact that she was not competing and that Stephens, the eventual winner, beat her older sister Venus to earn a place in the final.Stephens and Keys may want to enjoy their success while they can however, as Serena is now looking to come back with a vengeance.She shared video of herself practicing throughout her pregnancy, and there is just one more record she needs to break.
It’s hard to figure out what the end of your tennis career should look like,' said Serena.
I used to think I’d want to retire when I have kids, but no.
I’m definitely coming back.
Walking out there and hearing the crowd, it may seem like nothing.
But there’s no better feeling in the world'She then added: 'Obviously, if I have a chance to go out there and catch up with Margaret, I am not going to pass that up.
If anything, this pregnancy has given me a new power.
The 'Margaret' she refers to is Margaret Court, who has won 24 Grand Slam championships as opposed to Serena's 23 in women's singles.It is a record of lesser importance than the 22 wins Steffi Graf had which, like Serena's, were all in the open era.Court won most of her championships before 1968 and 11 came at the Australian Open during a time when the top players did not compete in the tournament.Serena will now have a chance to tie that record should she win in Australia this January, only this time with Alexis Jr watching.That was the 23rd grand slam win for Serena, and the first for Alexis Jr.Share or comment on this article:Serena Williams' New Orleans wedding preparation underwaye-mail184sharesMost watchedNews videosPolice block park after child tragically dies on Easter SundayHorrifying moment man killed after being shot in the head in HarlemHeartbroken Rabbi breaks down after three members of family killedFamily pays tribute to British sisters murdered in West BankHuge avalanche caught on camera in the French Alps kills fourMoment youth jumps onto train tracks as he is chased by police260-year-old gold coach to be used for King Charles' coronationNicola Sturgeon breaks cover for first time since house raidedMoment sparks fly from Ryanair jet while landing at Dublin AirportTate brothers appear at Romania's anti-organised crime unitRadiant Kate joins Wills and their three children for Easter serviceEaster travel chaos: Drivers trapped for THREE HOURS in car parkBingSiteWebEnter search term:SearchAdvertisementFemail TodayTaylor Swift puts on brave face as she dines with pals in NYC after Joe Alwyn split... just blocks from sentimental spot that inspired her song about him'I got lucky in a lot of ways': Jeremy Renner tells Jimmy Kimmel snow plow 'just missed every vertebrae, did not hit any organs' in near-fatal accidentAndrew Garfield is accused of 'yelling' at 'disrespectful' onlookers for distracting him while watching him film a new movie in LondonMillie Bobby Brown is engaged!

After Henry Windsor and Meghan Markle tied the knot Saturday to add another branch to Great Britain’s premier family tree, they retreated to Frogmore House (real placeand not just aMuppets-adjacent pun) for an evening of dancing, food, and Serena Williams beating everyone’s ass at the king of drinking games, beer pong.From British newspaperThe Sun:The bride’s US heritage was marked with the boozy American university drinking game beer pong, where players throw table tennis balls into cups of beers which their opponents then have to consume.The reception insider said: “Sere­na Williams played beer pong like it was tennis.
Everyone had so much fun with it, there were even fireworks.”First off ... U-S-A!
U-S-A!Secondly, there’s a lot to unpack in that quote.
Was Williams being her usual dominant self on the battle, just wrecking posh Londonites who had never seen the American curiosity before and thus had no stake in the argument over whether it should be called “beer pong” or “Beirut?” Or did she bring an actual racket to the table and spike people in the throat with overhead serves?While I very much want this to be the latter, the smart money is on the former.But that just raises more questions!
Were members of the royal family playing?
Were they drinking out of Solo cups?
What kind of beer were they drinking?
Was it of Pabst quality or lower, as is American pong tradition?Were bounces allowed?
How many re-racks did each team get?
Did Williams enforceRhode Island rules, where two balls in the same cup is worth three cups?
Did James Corden play, and did he talk trash about Jimmy Fallon’s awful celebrity beer pong segments while playing?I don’t know.
I just know Williams “played beer pong like it was tennis,” which means she won a whole bunch and probably did a lot of screaming.Little known fact: I often wear sneakers under my evening gown.

Her talent is obvious, and she has a record-breaking amount of wins to back it up.
Her zodiac sign is Libra, her ethnicity is African American, and her talent is unmatched.
She is the daughter of Richard Williams and Oracene Price and, besides her sister Venus, she grew up with three older half-sisters on her mother’s side.
After moving to Compton, California when she was four years old, the Williams sisters began to be trained by their parents, especially their father Richard.
She was later coached by professionals, including Rick Macci at his tennis academy, which the family moved to West Palm Beach, Florida for.
Williams turned professional in 1995, one year after her sister Venus.
Their powerful serves and ground strokes, and superb athleticism earned the sisters a great deal of attention.
The youngest Williams became the first of the two to win a Grand Slam singles title, winning the 1999 U.S. Open.In 2000, they won gold medals in the doubles event at the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.
Williams asserted herself in 2002 and won the French Open, the U.S. Open, and Wimbledon, defeating her older sister in the finals of each tournament.
She then won the Australian Open in 2003, becoming the sixth woman in the Open Era to do so, as well as the fifth woman to hold all Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously, a feat that got her the “Serena Slam” nickname.
Also that year, she came out the winner at Wimbledon, besting her older sister in the finals.
In 2005, Williams won the Australian Open again.
Having taken time off to recover after facing injuries and struggling with her mental health, she made her triumphant comeback in 2007 to win the Australian Open.
The sisters won their second doubles tennis gold medal at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.
That same year, Williams won the U.S. Open once again.
In 2009, she earned her 10th Grand Slam singles title by winning the Australian Open.

However, Williams broke Graf’s record at the 2017 Australian Open, where she defeated her sister in the final.
That same year, Williams announced that she was pregnant and would miss the rest of the 2017 season.
After giving birth and getting married to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, Williams returned to tennis in 2018.
At the 2020 ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand, she won her first singles event in about three years.

Williams began intensive tennis training at age three.
She won her first major championship in 1999 and completed the career Grand Slam in 2003.
Along with her individual success, Serena has teamed with sisterVenus Williamsto win a series of doubles titles.
In 2017, she defeated her big sister at the Australian Open to claim the 23rd Grand Slam singles title of her career.Early Life and FamilySerena Jameka Williams was born on September 26, 1981, in Saginaw, Michigan, to Richard and Oracene Williams.
The youngest of Richard's five daughters, Serena and her sister Venus would grow up to become great tennis champions.Serena's father — a former sharecropper from Louisiana determined to see his two youngest girls succeed — used what he'd gleaned from tennis books and videos to instruct Serena and Venus on how to play the game.
At the age of three, practicing on a court not far from the family's new Compton, California, home, Serena withstood the rigors of daily two-hour practices from her father.The fact that the family had relocated to Compton was no accident.
With its high rate of gang activity, Richard wanted to expose his daughters to the ugly possibilities of life "if they did not work hard and get an education."
In this setting, on courts that were riddled with potholes and sometimes missing nets, Serena and Venus cut their teeth on the game of tennis and the requirements for persevering in a tough climate.By 1991, Serena was 46-3 on the junior United States Tennis Association tour and ranked first in the 10-and-under division.
Sensing his girls needed better instruction to become successful professionals, he moved his family again — this time to Florida.
There, Richard let go of some of his coaching responsibilities, but not the management of Serena's and Venus' career.
Wary of his daughters burning out too quickly, he scaled back their junior tournament schedule.READ MORE: Serena and Venus Williams: How Their Father Made Them Tennis StarsThe Williams SistersSerena and her older sister Venus were groomed for a tennis career from the age of three years old by their father.
With their signature style and play, Venus and Serena changed the look of their sport.
Their sheer power and athletic ability overwhelmed opponents, and their sense of style and presence made them standout celebrities on the court.
The close-knit sisters lived together for more than a dozen years in a gated Palm Beach Gardens enclave in Florida, but they went their separate ways after Serena bought a mansion in nearby Jupiter in December 2013.In 1999, Serena beat out her sister Venus in their race to the family's first Grand Slam win when she captured the U.S. Open title.
It set the stage for a run of high-powered, high-profile victories for both Williams sisters.In 2008, Serena and Venus teamed up to capture a second women's doubles Olympic gold medal at the Beijing Games.
The next year, Serena and Venus purchased shares of the Miami Dolphins to become the first African American women to own part of an NFL team.At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Serena claimed her fourth overall Olympic gold medal by teaming with sister Venus to defeat Czech Republic stars Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka in women's doubles.Seeking to add to her hardware collection in the summer of 2015, Williams had to overcome big sister Venus to advance past the fourth round at Wimbledon.
A few days later, she defeated Garbine Muguruza in the final to claim her second career "Serena Slam" and become the oldest Grand Slam singles champion in the Open era.At the 2015 U.S. Open, Williams again squared off with Venus in a tough quarterfinal matchup, this time pulling away in the deciding third set.
The outcome left her two wins shy of the calendar year Grand Slam, a feat accomplished by just three women in the sport's history.
But it was not to be.
In a shocking upset, unseeded Roberta Vinci, ranked No.
43 in the world, dashed Williams' quest by pulling out a 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 win in the semifinals.Just hours after her singles win at Wimbledon in 2016, Serena and Venus won the doubles championship, their sixth Wimbledon win together.At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, the Williams sisters experienced a shocking upset when they were bounced out of the first round of women's doubles at the Rio Olympics by Czech duo Lucie Safarova and Barbora Strycova.
The Williams sisters had originally been seeded as no.
1, had an Olympic record of 15-0, and had won gold three times previously.Williams scored a historic victory at the 2017 Australian Open, winning her 23rd Grand Slam title after defeating her sister Venus, 6-4 6-4.
With her 23rd win, she surpassed Steffi Graf's total and captured the world number one ranking.Reflecting on her victory, Williams credited her sister as an inspiration.
I would really like to take this moment to congratulate Venus, she is an amazing person," she said.
There is no way I would be at 23 without her.
There is no way I would be at one without her.
She is my inspiration, she is the only reason.
I am standing here today and the only reason that the Williams sisters exist.
The Serena Slam’In 1995 Serena turned pro.
Two years later, she was already No.
99 in the world rankings — up from No.
304 just 12 months before.
A year later, she graduated high school and almost immediately inked a $12 million shoe deal with Puma.In 2002, Serena won the French Open, the U.S. Open, and Wimbledon, defeating sister Venus in the finals of each tournament.
She captured her first Australian Open in 2003, making her one of only six women in the Open era to complete a career Grand Slam.
The win also fulfilled her desire to hold all four major titles simultaneously to comprise what she'd dubbed "The Serena Slam.
Burnout & ComebackIn August 2003, Serena underwent knee surgery, and in September her half-sister Yetunde Price was murdered in Los Angeles, California.
Three years later, Serena seemed burned out.
Plagued by injuries, and just a general lack of motivation to stay fit or compete at the same level she once had, Serena saw her tennis ranking slump to 139.Serena credited her faith as a Jehovah's Witness, as well as a life-changing journey she made to West Africa, for renewing her pride and competitive fire.
In 2008, she won the U.S. Open.
By 2009, Williams reclaimed her place atop the world's rankings, winning both the 2009 Australian Open singles (for the fourth time) and Wimbledon 2009 singles (for the third time).
She also won the doubles matches at both the Australian Open and Wimbledon that year.ProbationWilliams made headlines in September 2009, when she blasted a lineswoman for a foot-fault called near the end of a semifinal loss to eventual champion Kim Clijsters at the U.S. Open.
The profanity-laced outburst included finger pointing and, according to the lineswoman, an alleged threat from Serena against her life.Williams downplayed what happened, refuting the allegation that she'd threatened the woman.
But the incident did not go over well with the tennis-viewing public, nor the U.S. Tennis Association, which fined her $10,000 on the spot.
Two months later, she was placed on two-year probation and ordered to pay another $82,500 to the Grand Slam committee for the episode, the largest punishment ever levied against a tennis player.By early 2010, Senena was back on track, winning the Australian Open singles and doubles matches as well as her fourth Wimbledon singles championship.Injuries and Retirement SpeculationIn 2011, Serena suffered a series of health scares after doctors found a blood clot in one of her lungs, which kept her away from tennis for several months.
Following several procedures, including one to remove a hematoma, speculation rose as to whether Williams would retire from the sport.Serena’s health improved by September 2011, however, and she looked like her old dominant self at the U.S. Open before falling to Samantha Stosur in the finals.Williams stumbled badly at the 2012 French Open, enduring a first-round loss for the first time at a major tournament.
But she was back in top form in London in July 2012, defeating 23-year-old Agnieszka Radwanska in an emotional three sets to claim her fifth Wimbledon singles title and first major championship in two years.At the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, Serena beatMaria Sharapovato take her first gold medal in women's singles.15th and 16th Grand Slam TitlesSerena continued her winning streak to her next Grand Slam event.
In September 2012, she beat out rival Victoria Azarenka to take the singles title at the U.S. Open.
According toUSA Today, Williams wasn't sure that she'd emerge victorious.
I honestly can't believe I won.
I was really preparing my runner-up speech, because I thought, 'Man, she's playing so great.
By this time, Serena had captured 15 Grand Slam singles titles and 13 Grand Slam doubles titles.
I would like to leave a mark," Serena once said about her standing in the tennis world.
I think obviously I will, due to the fact that I'm doing something different in tennis.
But I don't think I could ever reach something like aMartina Navratilova— I don't think I'd ever play that long — but who knows?
I think I'll leave a mark regardless.
In June 2013, Serena took her second French Open title — as well as her 16th Grand Slam singles title — in a 6-4, 6-4 victory over defending champion Sharapova.
I'm still a little bit upset about that loss last year," Serena said in an interview with ESPN following the match.
But it's all about, for me, how you recover.
I think I've always said a champion isn't about how much they win, but it's about how they recover from their downs, whether it's an injury or whether it's a loss.
2013 Wimbledon Loss and U.S. Open WinNearly one month later, Serena competed at Wimbledon, where she suffered a shocking loss (6-2, 1-6, 6-4) in the fourth round to Germany's Sabine Lisicki, the No.
23 seed.Her career-best 34-match winning streak over, Serena toldSports Illustrated, "I don't think it's a huge shock.
Lisicki] is a great player.
Her ranking has no effect on what she should be.
She should be ranked higher.
She just has a super, super game to play well on grass.
At the 2013 U.S. Open, Serena made a strong showing.
She knocked out her younger rival Sloane Stephens in the fourth round before upending Azarenka to clinch the U.S. Open title.
It was the second year in a row that the pair had faced off in the finals.20th Grand SlamSerena clinched her third straight and sixth overall U.S. Open singles title in 2014 by defeating her good friend Caroline Wozniacki.
Her winning ways carried into the new year, as she beat Sharapova to claim the 2015 Australian Open championship.
At the French Open in June, Serena managed to overcome illness to win the tournament for the third time and claim her 20th Grand Slam singles title, good for third place all-time.
When I was a little girl, in California, my father and my mother wanted me to play tennis," she told the crowd in French after her victory.
And now I'm here, with 20 Grand Slam titles.
2016 Losses and WinsSerena opened 2016 by advancing to the Australian Open final, where she lost in three sets to Angelique Kerber.
After notching career WTA title No.
70 with a win at the Italian Open, she advanced to a French Open final rematch with Muguruza, but this time succumbed to the Spanish player in straight sets.On July 9, 2016, Serena found her way back to victory, defeating Kerber 7-5, 6-3 at Wimbledon and winning her 22nd grand slam title.
With her historic win, Serena tied Steffi Graf for the most major championships in the Open era of professional tennis, which started in 1968.
I have definitely had some sleepless nights with a lot of stuff, coming so close and feeling it and not being able to get there," Serena told reporters.
This tournament I came in with a different mindset.
In Melbourne I thought I played well but Angelique played great, and better.
So I knew going into this one I needed to be calm and be confident and play the tennis I've been playing for well over a decade.

Whatever you do, if you have the right mindset you are gonna make it.
Some players that I know they are champions in their minds.
He continued about Djokovic:"I remember Novak.

Because they all want to succeed.
But they have no idea how because they don’t know how they should process.
You need to feel confident that you are going to make it.

Below, an edited and condensed from a roundtable with reporters at theLotte New York Palaceahead of the U.S. Open.What's the passport stamp you're proudest of, and why?SW:For me, I’d sayany of my African stamps.
Probably Ghana.
I had a lot of fun there.
It was so beautiful, and there’s so much history there—it was really cool.VW:I’d probably say Slovenia.
It’s justoff the beaten path.
I didn’t know I was going to go there; it’s a beautiful country.
Not a lot of Americans focus on it, either, so I’d probably say that one.
I couldn’t say Africa, as I had to say something else, so…What are some of your favorite domestic destinations?SW:I would say home.
There’s really big meaning to that saying,there’s no place like home.Whenever I’m home, I’m so happy.VW:One of my favorite places isWashington, D.C.When people think of big cities, sometimes they forget D.C., and it’s beautiful, got lots of European flair; a lot of culture and great restaurants—pretty much everything.Sisters Serena, left, and Venus Williams shake hands after a 1991 game in Compton, California.GettyYou both travel a lot.
Dream minibar—what’s in it?SW:That’s a great question.VW:It is!
It would have to be some sort of green drink, or that sort of thing.SW:Okay, see, I was going to go with some Sour Patch Watermelons.VW:I kind of retired from that life, so I don’t want to go backwards.Laughs.So, I mean, ok. We have a green drink.
We definitely have to have water because we’reathletes, we have to drink [it], all the time.SW:Starbursts?VW:Well for you, it’sgot to be tacos.SW:I know, I was thinking that—how do you fit that in a minibar, though?
Maybe the microwavable kind.VW:She has to have tacos.
And we have dogs, soin the minibarwe have to have dog treats in there.
That’s four things, so what’s the fifth…eyeliner?SW:Mascara?VW:Something like when you’re just on the go, and you think, “Oh, if I just had someeyeliner or mascara, it would change my life.”Rafael Nadal on Why Home Is His Favorite Vacation SpotYou guys lived together for awhile, then moved into separate houses a few years ago.
What's it like being neighbors instead of roommates?VW:We have all the food at my house, so she’s over every night for dinner.SW:I basically eat and leave.VW:Our plan is to ultimately move next door to each other, so this has been a process of getting there.
Right now we’re across the street from each other, more or less by one block.
My placeis Zen, her place is fun.SW:I don’t even know if you know I’m over there.
Sometimes I go practice and I’ll shower, because my clothes are still there.
I’ll change, and I’ll head on out.
I’m slowly bringing things over that way, but the flip side is, when Ishower, I leave my dirty clothes there.VW:That really makes no sense.Laughs.SW:The slowest move ever.Topicstennisserena williamsvenus williamsThe DailyOur most popular newsletter for destination inspiration, travel tips, trip itineraries, and everything else you need to be an expert traveler in this beautiful worldSign upBy subscribing to our newsletter(s) you agree to ourUser AgreementandPrivacy Policy & Cookie Statement.More from Condé Nast TravelerThe Art of the Window Seat Exit StrategyByCNT EditorsHow I Travel: James Patterson Needs to Fly with M&MsByKaitlin MenzaOn Location: Chasing John Wick From Osaka to Berlin to ParisByCharlie HobbsThe New Business Traveler: Lesse Skincare's Neada Deters Squeezes Museum Visits Between Meetings in ParisByLale ArikogluIn Morocco, Maryam el Gardoum Is Nurturing a New Generation of Women SurfersByFrankie AdkinsAn In-Depth Analysis of Airplane Drinking EtiquetteByCNT EditorsPinterestFacebookSnapchatInstagramTwitterCondé Nast Traveler does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

1 Trending Travel Destination — and It Doesn't Involve TennisThough Venus Williams admits her perfect vacation sounds like a "dream," she says it's possible "with the proper planning"ByNick MaslowNick MaslowInstagramTwitterSenior News Editor, PEOPLEPeople Editorial GuidelinesPublished on November 26, 2019 05:15 PMShareTweetPinEmailIfVenus Williamsis on vacation at a resort, don’t go looking for her on the tennis court.“No, I didn’t bring my racquets,” the tennis superstar, 39, tells PEOPLE while celebratingAmerican Express Travel’s 2020 Trending Destinationsat The Greenwich Hotel’s TriBeCa Penthouse.“That is not a vacation!” she adds, making it clear that her ideal getaway involves “no responsibilities and obligations,” but rather tons of rest and relaxation — to the point where she just might spend her perfect day in bed and indulging in treats.“I’d wake up late, breakfast in bed, fall back to sleep, wake up and watch a movie, get up and maybe have a massage,” she says of her ideal day.
Also on this day, I get to eat junk food and not gain weight.
So you know, I had champagne at breakfast!
Another mimosa when I woke up.
I woke up to a foot massage… This is a dream, right?
But I think that with the proper planning, this all could happen.”Craig Barritt/GettyTo get those plans right, Williams says she turns to the folks at American Express, with whom she’s partnered since she was 15 and traveling the world on the tennis circuit.RELATED VIDEO: Yes, You Can Now Fly With Your Thanksgiving Turkey“I love theFine Hotels & Resorts program,” she adds.
Sometimes I just dream and look through the hotels, like you’re online and you’re just like, ‘Ugh, if I could go there one day,’ and then it’s like, ‘Nope, go to the tournament!’ I love just looking through that list and dreaming, and of course this new and current list of amazing hotels for 2020, if I could get my life to where I was at each one, that’d be good.”Kauai, Hawaii.GettyThis year’s list highlights hotspots like Buenos Aires, Grand Cayman, Shanghai, Cairo, the French Riviera, the Italian Alps, Montana, and more — including Williams’ pick: Kauai, Hawaii.“I’m a warm-weather girl at heart and I love a beautiful beach,” Williams told AmEx.
I went on an amazing trip with my family to Kauai.
The overall experience is a memory we will never forget.”The company selected the island destination because of its emphasis on nature: “Smaller and less crowded than neighboring Oahu and Maui, Kauai has managed to keep much of its prehistoric wilds intact,” the company notes.
Only a fraction of the 550-square-foot island’s territory — arid in the south, lush in the north — is accessible by paved road, making Kauai a paradise for the adventurous traveler.”Venus Williams Says She and Sister Serena Get Nervous Watching Each Other’s MatchesGrand Hyatt Kaua`i Resort & Spa.Grand HyattAmong Williams’ other favorite trips is a jaunt she took in Australia.“I went to Australia and I got to go to the Outback — I never thought I’d do something like that,” she says.
I’ve had the opportunity, but I never have the time, and getting to Australia isn’t easy.

And when the time comes for that long-haul flight, Williams says she’ll relish the time to disconnect.“I don’t mind those flights because I can sleep, I can relax,” she says.

I grew up watchingMonica SelesandSteffi Graf.
They inspired me a lot because they were champions,"she started.
But without any doubt, my true inspiration has been Venus.
She pushed me to keep going and to give my best every day.
What we learned on the tennis court, we applied in life.
When she became the world no.
1, I wanted to do it as well, when she reached the US Open final at the beginning of her career, I wanted to do it.
I wanted to be like her.”Venus Williamshas won seven Grand Slam, but probably the biggest impact she has done for the sport was when she fought and succeeded to get Wimbledon to award equal prize money to women, after that amazing battle the rest of the Grand Slam did the same.Richard Williams, center, with his daughters Venus, left, and Serena in 1991.

The sisters were coached by their father, Richard Williams when they first burst onto the tour.Serena Williamswho since 2012 is coached byPatrick Mouratoglou, but she still considers her father as her greatest coach.
My dad is an incredible coach, the best one I have ever worked with.
Probably he is the best coach of all time.
He started from nothing, he picked up a book, a racket and he did it at the age of 40,”she said.Toughest competitor and the next generationNot only Venus Williams is her biggest idol, but she is also the toughest competitor she has ever played against.
It's a tough question.
I will obviouslysaysVenus.Martina Hingis,JustineHenin,andKim Clijstersalso had great moments.Lindsay Davenportwas a very interesting player too and now there is the new generationwithmanyhigh-qualityplayers.
That next generation of tennis is also ready causing problems for Williams, one of them isGarbiñe Muguruzawho defeated Williams to win her first Grand Slam title at theFrench Open.
Another younger player is who took away from her theAustralian Opentitle,Angelique Kerber.
Those have been tough losses for the world number one who is still one major behind Steffi Graf.
However, those defeats have not disheartened her.
I do not think it helped me to grow, I have already grown.
There was much pressure and I tried to give my best.
I made too many errors and she played better, it happens.

Every time I reach a Grand Slam final or a final in any other tournament I am excited.
I am starting to appreciate these moments even more because I know I am not eternal.
It's incredible that I have played so much.
I never thought that I would have done it.
I have been winning my first and last Grand Slam title in three different decades, I am grateful for the chance I had.
She also spoke about how she feels now that she is considered an icon.“When I was a kid I never thought to become a global icon, I only thought about reaching US Open final, I only focused on tennis.
Now it's different, people watch me with admiration and they hope I am successful.
No matter when she retires, Williams has made it clear that she will still have dreams she’ll need to fulfill.
There are always dreams to fulfill, I think that without dreams you cannot get results,"she beamed.TennisNewsWTA Miami: Petra Kvitova tops Elena Rybakina to win 30th career title6 days agoVAVELVAVEL USATennisSerena Williams talks about her true inspiration, best coach, and dreamsVAVELis a global sports multi-platform and media company that operates with its own technology.

2][3]He was the coach ofSerena Williamsfrom June 2012 to 2022.
Since Spring 2022, Mouratoglou has been the coach ofSimona Halep.Coaching career[edit]He founded the Mouratoglou Tennis Academy in 1996 near Paris (later relocated to the outskirts ofNice), and has coached many up-and-coming players, includingMarcos Baghdatis(whom he coached to the final of the2006 Australian Open),Julia Vakulenko,Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova,Aravane Rezaï,Irena Pavlovic,Jérémy Chardy,Laura Robson,Yanina WickmayerandGrigor Dimitrov.
4]Mouratoglou started coaching theATPplayerMarcos Baghdatisin 1999 when Mouratoglou invited him to his Tennis Academy in October 1999, on a one-week basis.
Baghdatis was, according to Mouratoglou, "not an athlete at all", however within seven years he would become a junior world No.
1, win the2003 Australian Openboys' title, reach the final of the same tournament in2006and reach the world's top ten.
5]In July 2007, he started coachingAnastasia Pavlyuchenkova.
Within two years, Pavlyuchenkova reached the world's top 30 and has since made two Grand Slam quarterfinals and reached a career-high ranking of world No.
13.
6]They ended their association in August 2009, and Mouratoglou moved onto coaching bothAravane Rezaï[7]andYanina Wickmayer.
8]Rezaï enjoyed a successful2010season, entering the world's top 20 and winning the Premier event inMadridwhilst Wickmayer reached a career-high ranking of world No.

11]In March 2012, Mouratoglou started coachingGrigor Dimitrovand set about guiding him back into the world's top 100, having dropped to No.
102 by the time he started.
4][12]This association ended in September that year and Mouratoglou moved on to coachingSerena Williams.By the time Mouratoglou started coaching Williams, she had just suffered her first-ever opening-round defeat in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, losing in the first round of the2012 French Open.
Since then, Mouratoglou has guided Williams to her fifth, sixth and seventhWimbledontitles, theOlympic gold medal, her fourth, fifth, and sixthUS Opentitles, her second and thirdFrench Opentitles, three consecutiveyear-end championshipstitles, her sixth and seventhAustralian Opentitle and lifted her back to No.

Champions think like champions,” Mouratoglou tells Olympic Channelin an exclusive interview.“Champions never look behind them.
They always, whatever they achieve, they forget it the second after and they look at the future: ‘What's next?
What's my next goal?’”There are lots of goals within the Mouratoglou camp, notably for Serena, who has been outspoken inher quest to win a 24th Grand Slamin singles, which would equal the all-time record.
Williams already holds the Open Era record for majors won (23).Star coach Patrick Mouratoglou: My approach to forming a world class playerWith 2021 the next time we’ll see Serena on a tennis court, that 24th major remains a priority, Mouratoglou confirmed.”Serena's goals have not changed since she came back to tennis after giving birth:She still feels that she can win Grand Slams,” he said.
If she can have some Olympic gold medals, she would be extremely happy, too, because that's also a great achievement for any athlete in any sport.
But) the last three years were disappointing because even though she reached four Grand Slam finals, she was not able to win one.”Williams gave birth to daughterAlexis Olympiain September of 2017.
After an initial comeback in March of 2018, Williams reached the final of both Wimbledon and the US Open in 2018 as well as in 2019.
She lost each of those four finals in straight sets.At the 2020 US Open, Williams made the semi-finals, losing to fellow mumVictoria Azarenka.“I (can) feel that her motivation is absolutely intact, maybe bigger” for 2021, Mouratoglou said.
It was difficult for her to find new balance as a mother and as a professional athlete.
And I feel like she's finding it.
I feel like she's understanding what it's going to take for her to win one or several other Grand Slams.
And I feel like she's prepared to pay the price for that.
So I'm extremely excited for 2021.
I can't wait for it.”Serena Williams wins singles gold at London 2012Coaching philosophy: ‘Each player is different’Serena, along with Tsitsipas and Gauff, spends time training at theMouratoglou Tennis Academy, located near the port city of Nice, France.
Tsitsipas has gone from No.91 in the world to start 2018 to the top 5 in 2020.
Gauff, still only 16, was ranked No.686 just two years ago.
She’s now a top 50 player, with wins over the likes ofNaomi Osaka,Venus Williamsand other top stars.“My coaching philosophy is about doing something different with each player because each player is different,” said Mouratoglou, who turned 50 this year.
If I go back to the ‘90s when I started my tennis academy, nobody was doing that.”Mouratoglou, who has also worked with the likes of top players likeMarcos Baghdatis,Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova,Grigor Dimitrov,Jeremy Chardyand more, believes individualized training – even for a sport like tennis that requires a lot of repetition – is the key to greatness, to making champions.“In order not to waste the talent, you have to fulfill the needs of each of the players,” he said.
And those needs are completely different.
What makes our job as coaches interesting is the fact that every time with each player, it's completely different.
I have to take all that into consideration.”Mouratoglou likes to start with what he calls a “blank page” when working with a player: Why do they play?
What is their philosophy?
How do they “feel” the court?
With Serena, she came to him after the first (and still only) first-round loss at a major in her career at the French Open in 2012, searching for answers.
Tsitsipas and Gauff, meanwhile, he has helped shape from a young age, in tandem with their respective parents, who serve as head coaches.“I have to imagine them as future players.
How will they play in the future?” Mouratoglou said.
That's what makes my job absolutely incredible: I have to think and imagine.
... (My) creativity, I think, is one of the biggest qualities that this job requires.”The Williams Sisters at age 11 and 12Serena’s quest for more gloryWilliams,a four-time Olympic gold medallist, has won 10 of her 23 singles majors – as well as her aforementioned London singles gold (as well as doubles with Venus) – after linking up with Mouratoglou in 2012 at the age of 30.Withher 40thbirthdayset for September of 2021, the tennis superstar isn’t backing down.
She has already committed to playing at theAustralian Openin January, the next major on the tennis calendar.Mouratoglou said Serena’s commitment to the challenge of coming back at age 36 in 2018 after giving birth continues still today.“Her comeback was extremely difficult for two reasons: Her body completely changed because she became a mother and she had to bring back the body of a professional top athlete, which is something huge,” he said.
Second, mentally, because becoming a mother for a woman is one of the biggest, probably mental changes in a woman's life.
And she knew she had to find a new balance.”For Mouratoglou, it’s about Serena’s “level” in the past three seasons: She’s consistently found herself deep at tournaments with the top players in the world, including the US Open just a few weeks ago.“When you reach four Grand Slam finals and she the semis at the last U.S. Open, you don't feel like you're so far away from winning one,” he explained.
But it's a big disappointment because for Serena, being in the final will never be a goal.”The goal, of course, it to win titles.
But does that make getting to 24 majors the ultimate goal?“I told her, ‘You want to set up your own record?’ Maybe it’s going to be 24, maybe 25, maybe 28. Who knows.”Tsitsipas and Gauff: Future – no, current – game-changersWhile Mouratoglou wears the badge of “Serena’s coach” with pride, he also works in tandem with the families of Tsitsipas and Gauff as their respective coach.
Both young players have spent a large amount of time training at his academy in France, and he often accompanies them to the biggest stops on the tennis tour.Tsitsipas, 22, has become a star in his home country of Greece withfive career titlesalready to his name, includingthe ATP Finalslast November.
While his booming game, with a strapping single-handed backhand and brute physicality, have taken him far, Mouratoglou sees other X-factors as the reason why he could be so great.“Stefanos is extremely special, and I believe that he has everything to become a champion,” Mouratoglou said.
I really believe that he has everything to achieve (a Grand Slam).
I think he's driven.
And I think he's a bit obsessed with tennis, which is something that is extremely important.
I think champions are obsessive with their sports, like a music genius might be (about their craft).”Mouratoglou recalls a story very similar to that of Serena in 2012 when he characterizes the kind of drive Tsitsipas has.
It was after the then-20-year-old had stunnedRoger Federerat the Australian Open in 2019, a breakout win for the young gun.
Two rounds later, he lost toRafael Nadalin the semi-finals.“I think that 99.9 percent of players would be extremely happy to reach their first Slam semi, beating Federer and losing to Nadal,” Mouratoglou said.
Stefanos) was destroyed.
He was like, ‘I can't believe what happened.’ He was he was extremely unsatisfied about his results, which I believe is a great thing.”“He wants to be at the top of the game.
That's the thing that drives him every day.
And he will not be satisfied with the good results.
He wants great results.”Gauff, too, wants similar great results, and has had many expectations lumped onto her shoulders as a teenager.
At Wimbledon in 2019,she was the youngest player ever to qualify(win three matches in a pre-tournament) for the event,then beat idol Venusin the first round en route to a run to the second week.She became a global sporting name nearly overnight.
Since then, Gauff has reacheda career-high No.47in the WTA rankings (Nov. 2020) and is the youngest female player in the top 100.“Her potential is absolutely huge.
She has so many qualities (and) she's still 16,” said Mouratoglou of Gauff.
We shouldn't forget that.
Second thing, she still needs to develop her game; she has a big room for improvement.
I think we should give her a time to continue to develop.
It’s still a long way to go.
She'll get there at some point, but things take time.”Mouratoglou said the age eligibility rule in women’s tennis, put in place to prevent burnout of young prodigies, has held Gauff back, though she already has nine wins on the Grand Slam stage.COVID challenges for tennis – and what it can learnThe COVID-19 global pandemic has certainly provided all sports with a myriad of challenges.
Tennis was on hold for much of 2020, from March through to late July, and only a handful of tournaments at the highest level have resumed, players adhering to strict social distancing and “bubble” rules.Mouratoglou sees the challenges as multi-layered: Not just the question of if a player can practise, but with whom, how often, where, can they do off-court training, do they have access to a gym?
It’s about making the “best out of what is possible” for each athlete, he said.But Mouratoglou feels as though tennis has done well in the past decade to further its standards, as athletes have taken their physical and mental fitness to the next level,building teams around themand often travelling with a trainer, a physiotherapist – or both.It’s a page that’s been taken out of other sports’ playbook – for the better.Now it’s a team atmospherein a sport where players used to only travel with a single coach.“(Tennis) has become much more professional and it has become much, much more physical,” he said.“And of course, tennis has taken a lot from other sports in terms of how to improve the physical abilities of the players.
Recovery, injury prevention... all those things have become so important.”The world of sport work out together on #OlympicDay!It’s why Mouratoglou believes players like Serena are still competing at the top of the sport into their late 30s.
And why – perhaps – we could see Tsitsipas and Gauff on the court for many years to come.The importance lies ina #StrongerTogether mentality: Even for a sport like tennis, it’s about the team a player surrounds him or herself with.“For people who haven't played individual sport, I don't think it's possible to realize how much it's valuable to have these people around you that think day in, day out, about how to help you, how to make you better, how to use all your potential and bring it to the top of what it can become,” Mouratoglou said.
This is just magic to have this around you.
So the team brings this magic.
The fact that this is your (crew) that you can count on; they’re here for you, they believe in you.”Women's Doubles Final - Tennis | London 2012 ReplaysConnect with the world’s best athletes like never before.

According to his tweet, Halep trained at his academy in France prior to the BNP Paribas Open in March and then asked him if he was available to coach her.
He initially declined the offer.
I have the highest respect for her but it was out of the question at the time," Mouratoglou wrote.
A few weeks later, I had a conversation with Serena, and the door opened for me, at least short term, to work with someone else.

However the 23-time major champion may have been seeking to dispel such notions with a video posted to her Instagram story later Thursday.
Joined byGreen Bay PackersquarterbackAaron Rodgersat a bitcoin conference in Miami, Williams indicated she will be returning to competition at Wimbledon in June.
We've been talking about my comeback, and [Rodgers has] been hyping me up and getting me ready for Wimbledon," Williams said.The video ends with Rodgers pointing at Williams and saying, "She's back.
In December, Williams said she was "not where I need to be physically to compete" as she announced she wouldn't be playing the year's first Grand Slam at the Australian Open.
Since then she has been mostly silent about her return to the sport or other plans, and her ranking has fallen to No.

Ever wonder how she fuels those powerful serves?
So did we, which is why we went right to the source, to ask one of the two most famous sisters in tennis about how she eats, how she cooks, and what victory truly tastes like.Is there a Williams-family signature dish?Serena Williams: That's easy: My mom's chicken, with rice and gravy.
It was my favorite dish as a kid, and it still is now.
That's my favorite meal from her or from anybody.
I was just competing in Australia, and she was going to make it for me, but she forgot.
Now she owes me!
It's a family favorite.
But there are more.
Venus cooks a lot.
My other two other sisters cook.
For years, I was always making gumbo for everyone.
My other go-to dishes are something I call a "seven-bean delight," which really only has five beans, but don't tell.
Everyone loves my roasted chicken with garlic; for a minute, it was my turkey tacos.
Now it's vegan sushi.
I just love to cook!Can you recite one of those recipes by heart?SW: The easiest is my roasted chicken recipe.
I make it French style.
I put whole cloves of garlic all over the dish.
Some under the skin, some inside the chicken, some inside the pan.
I put butter on top of the bird, and butter inside the gut.
It's not a light dish!
I add only a little salt and pepper, not too much.
Then I throw small baby onions everywhere, drizzle olive oil on top and roast away.Is there a cookbook you're obsessed with?SW: My go-to cookbook is calledEat Yourself Sexy!
I've been eating a lot healthier for my sister [Ed note: This is because of Venus'sSjogren Syndrome] so the cookbook has all these raw meals, green juices, and smoothies.
For me, "green" used to mean "yuck."
But I've incorporated a lot of raw things in my diet this year.
Venus calls us "chegan"—because we cheat with a little bit of fish and chicken.If you could eat a meal cooked by any chef in the world, who would it be?SW: My mom!
I grew up watching my mom in the kitchen, that's how I know anything about cooking.
I've always wanted to go to a culinary class actually.
Besides my mom, I love Bobby Flay, Emeril, Morimoto—that guy is awesome.What are your favorite Wimbledon eats?SW: For Wimbledon, our chef,Lauren Von Der Pool, travels with us because I try to eat really healthy at that one.
No roasted chicken on that trip for me.
We have either her or my mom make our meals around match time.
Unfortunately, there's no real "restaurant-hopping" when I'm away.
Truthfully, I don't eat a lot before my matches.
I can't eat because I get too nervous.
I'll force myself to really carb up the night before, especially later on in the tournament, because I know I wont be able to eat in the morning.
But carbing-up doesn't mean pasta—I'm more into brown rice or sprouted quinoa.What do you eat once you win?SW: Celebration food is always my mom's chicken.
I request it every time, along with her biscuits.Are you a sweet or savory person?SW: I'm the deadliest of both: savoryandsweet.
I love those molten lava cakes, the ones where you cut into it and the chocolate spills out.
Even if it's terrible, I can't say no to those.
The best ones are at Nobu because they serve it with green tea ice cream.
Ridiculously delicious.If you could get an endorsement deal from any food, what would it be?SW: Oh my god, I don't know!
Okay.
I love moon pies.
If "Moon Pie" sponsored me, I'd be bigger than any house on this planet!
I love the originals: banana, chocolate, or vanilla.
Now I really want a Moon Pie!Describe your last dinner party.SW: I cook for my family a lot, but I've only thrown one proper dinner party, and it was when I was in my gumbo stage.
I made a fish-based gumbo because I don't eat red meat or pork.
It was basically seared barramundi with mangoes over quinoa, and kale with a mustard sauce on the side.What's your ideal dinner party music?SW: Either soft '90s or jazz.
John Coltrane, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and you can't play jazz without Miles Davis.If you could cook dinner for anyone, who would it be and what would you serve?SW: Arthur Ashe and Althea Gibson, because they were black and played tennis, andthatwasn't popular in their time.
Both are dead now, but I'd really love to have them over.
I'd just make a quick salad so we could talk and talk.What does victory taste like?SW: Victory is very, very sweet.
It tastes better than any dessert you've ever had.Do you drink?SW: I'm very much a glass-of-wine girl.
I love Cabernets, and most French wines.
But I'm not a wine snob—I'm cool with a $7 bottle of Riesling from the local Publix.Where is your dream eating trip?SW: I have to say: South Carolina.
I love the Southern palate.
Those southern meals, there's nothing like it.
I'm always eating really healthy now, so I dream of those.What's always in your fridge?SW: My fridge is really just vegan: coconut water, Gatorade (my favorite!
 cucumbers, mint, kale, vegetables, ginger, and wheat grass.What foods do you detest?SW: I hate avocados.
The texture is so yucky in my mouth.
I don't love tomatoes, but if they're diced up I can get them down.
And while I really love Japanese food, I can't do those fish eggs that are really fat, big, and orange.
I don't like those.How do you eat when flying?SW: These days, I bring a green drink for the plane and something like a wrap with sprouts and fake-tuna made of walnuts.
It's actually really, really good!Do you have a food philosophy?SW:You put out what you put in.In other words, just because I get all this exercise, it doesn't mean I don't have to think about it.Explore Bon AppétitFamilyHealthyInterviewsRead MorecultureWhy Does Costco’s $4.99 Rotisserie Chicken Taste…Soapy?

How Serena Williams' Vegan Chef Built Her Career and Celebrity ClienteleSkip to contentJoin UsContactReadJoin UsContactReadCelebrities>CultureHow Serena Williams’ Vegan Chef Built Her Career and Celebrity ClienteleVegan chef Lauren Von der Pool has traveled around the world with A-list clients including Common, Stevie Wonder, and tennis champions Venus andSerena Williams, and has brought plant-based food to high-profile events like Grammys and the White House, but her life almost looked drastically different.As a teen, Von der Pool was a self-described “gangster” who grew up in a tough part of Washington, D.C., where murders were common and gang violence was rampant.
She spent her time with a crew called the Young Thug Bitches, and lost 13 friends to violence in one year when she was just 14-years-old.
People cannot even believe that,” she tells LIVEKINDLY exclusively.
And the majority of the people who were in my group are dead now.”At 16, she was stabbed in the head from behind by a girl she’d gotten in a previous altercation with and came within half an inch of losing her life.
The “tragic,” near-death experience quite literally altered the course of her life and changed how she saw the world as well as her own place in it.
Von der Pool, who once ate candy bars and chips for breakfast without so much as a second thought, knew she needed to change the environment around her.
She said goodbye to the “poison” that is processed foods and became an overnight vegan.“I feel that changing what I ate was my savior.
It shifted me and it made me more aware of the other things that there were possibilities for me,” she shares.
It made me understand healing from a holistic standpoint, not just food.” Instead of wolfing down a bag of Hot Cheetos, Von der Pool turned to whole foods like dandelion greens and papaya, which she soon realized contained enzymes that improved her digestion and her skin.
She also noticed that she was thinking more clearly and felt better overall.“[The stabbing] knocked some sense into my head because it just shifted my course completely,” she explains, noting that she read the bookHeal Thyselfby her “now mentor” Queen Afua during her recovery and discovered the power of plants.
Though Von der Pool had grown up thinking of food solely as sustenance,Heal Thyselfhelped her see and understand vegan food’s “magic” powers.
The next day, it was like my intuition was turned on and I began to listen impeccably to that voice inside of me,” she says.https://www.instagram.com/p/CJRj6Heh1pg/Fighting for food justiceAfter nearly losing her life, Von der Pool immediately stopped eating the processed foods she’d grown up with and began nourishing her body with plants—specifically raw foods.
To live, and more accurately to thrive, she knew she needed to change the crowd she was hanging out with as well as the food she was putting into her body.She began volunteering at a local health food store, and was given fresh produce in exchange for her services.
This exposed Von der Pool to whole foods that she wasn’t previously familiar with, and she used this produce to whip up an array of vegan treats.
As she quickly learned via her own experience, this plant-based approach helped her heal and aided her recovery.
Food is magical.
Food has power.
It can shift everything in your world.
The lesson I’ve got is that everything we eat becomes a part of everything we are,” she shares.With her own recovery well underway thanks, in part, to her transition to veganism, Von der Pool shifted her focus to her hometown, which she describes as a “murder capital” and a food desert, meaning its residents had almost no access to affordable and nutritious food.
To the budding chef, the violence around her was undoubtedly linked to a poor diet dominated by fast food and junk food, because that “poison” begets violence.Conversely, Von der Pool sees healthy food as a foundation and a key to curbing that violence.
The revolution starts within,” she explains.
It starts inside [with what we eat] and then it reverberates outside of ourselves.”In an effort to help fight for food justice and transform the D.C. food scene, she left the health food store and activated her entrepreneurial spirit by selling her own raw pies and other raw vegan food in front of Howard University’s business school.
Much like vegan food had helped her through a difficult time, Von der Pool wanted to use it to help others in her neighborhood, especially since affordable, nutritious food was almost impossible to find.Though the Howard students were reticent at first, Von der Pool was soon making thousands of dollars a week selling her plant-based treats, proving that D.C. had an appetite for nutritious meals, even if the area itself wasn’t readily offering them.
Once I gave everyone a taste, they wanted more of it,” she says.https://www.instagram.com/p/CDUEfrOhvc5/Getting her start as a vegan chefVon der Pool’s stint at Howard University caught the attention of Westley Howard, founder of Egyptian Magic Healing Skin Cream.
The wealthy businessman became her mentor and later her godfather, and she began cooking vegan meals for him professionally.
God has blessed me with great people who’ve stood the test of time in my life,” she says.Throughout her time with Howard, Von der Pool once again witnessed the power of a plant-based diet firsthand.
The entrepreneur had colon cancer and was scheduled to have most of his colon removed, but his health drastically improved within six months of working with Von der Pool.
In addition to a vegan diet with herbal tonics, which Von der Pool says was a “foundational piece” of her mentor’s healing process, she began to do sound healing and affirmations with him as a way to raise his consciousness.Though Von der Pool didn’t specify if other medical interventions were used, Howard was cancer-free within six months.
She notes that this positive experience propelled her forward, further into the plant-based space.Howard encouraged a then 18-year-old Von der Pool to enroll at the Cordon Bleu School of Culinary Arts in Pasadena, California, which is where she first met legendary chef Wolfgang Puck.
From there, she worked for his catering company and her career really took off.
Within a month of me being at culinary school, I was catering the Oscars, the Grammys and the American Music Awards with Wolfgang, and really bringing vegan and raw foods into that realm,” she notes, pointing out that the chefs on the team hadn’t yet heard of now popular vegan foods like quinoa.
Even though it wasn’t a vegan catering company, I really helped to bring veganism to that realm.”Venus Williams, one of Von der Pool’s former clients, agrees, andwrote as muchin the chef’s 2012 book,Eat Yourself Sexy.
Lauren is leading the charge for healthy and delicious meals in America,” the pro athlete declared.https://www.instagram.com/p/ZNoboqJ5T0/Cooking for vegan athletesVon der Pool began working with the Williams sisters around 2011 after being introduced to them through Common, who dated Serena.
As she recalls, Serena was motivated to give a plant-based diet a try in solidarity withVenusafter Venus was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called Sjogren’s syndrome.As a vegan chef, Von der Pool is keenly aware of the “power” she has, so she meditates before whipping up any dishes and finds her balance.
As she puts it, “I am aware that how I feel and who I am is impacting the food just as much as the food is impacting me.” Then, the culinary expert taps into what she wants to taste or wants her client to taste and feel, and sets out to create a multi-sensory experience.While each client obviously has different taste preferences and dietary requirements, Van der Pool has a roster of go-to vegan ingredients that includes coconut aminos, pink Himalayan salt, coconut oil, and plum vinegar.
She also loves to decorate her dishes with edible flowers to make them more visually appealing.When it comes to the food itself, Von der Pool mixes flavors and textures, and plays with presentation in an attempt to give people a unique experience.
It’s just these surprises from left and right, and having these different notes,” she says.
I want you to be completely moved.
I want you to remember that you sat at my table to eat for the rest of your life.
That’s what I go for.”Not surprisingly, Von der Pool’s culinary approach varies from client to client.
When working with the Williams sisters, athletic performance was obviously important.
Von der Pool knew she had to prepare the “right” foods, including meals and juices packed with plenty of protein, such as nuts, beans, and seeds that could then be transformed into something completely different.For example, one of Serena’s favorite meals is Von der Pool’s “Grand Slammin’ Tacos” which include vegan “meat” made out of nuts mixed with a flavorful seasoning blend that features cumin, paprika, and more.
Serena has even made the tacos on her own, as shesharedwithUSA Todayin June 2013.
I used different nuts and it was delicious.
I used a soft shell taco, cashews, walnuts and sunflower seeds,” she said at the time.
I put them in a mixer.
You soak the nuts overnight and after you mix them you put them in the dehydrator.
After that, I add seasoning, so it actually tastes like meat.”Serena also noted that she frequently consults Von der Pool’sEat Yourself Sexycookbook when cooking on her own, calling it “a fun way to have great smoothies, [and a] great way to get different proteins in your system without eating meat.”https://www.instagram.com/p/Bg6TK3tnkMh/Von der Pool is quick to slam the notion that elite athletes like the Williams sisters need meat in their diets in order to thrive on the court or field.
People have this idea that you cannot be a high level athlete or high level performer on a vegan diet,” she says.
And that’s just absolutely not true, because the only thing that changed with Serena was me and her food.” Othervegan athletes, such as NBA star Kyrie Irving and football player Colin Kaepernick, are proof positive that vegan diets can lead to athletic success.
In fact, many plant-based sports pros say they feel stronger, more agile, and more energetic after removing meat and animal products from their diets.In addition to the aforementioned protein, which is essential for muscle recovery, pro athletes on a vegan diet need to make sure they’re getting enough calcium and carbohydrates.
Consuming enough calories in a day to fuel their muscles and prevent fatigue is also important.
I’ll force myself to really carb up the night before [Wimbledon], especially later on in the tournament, because I know I won’t be able to eat in the morning,” SerenatoldBon Appétitin 2013.
But carbing-up doesn’t mean pasta—I’m more into brown rice or sprouted quinoa.”To ensure that Serena was getting the nutrients she needed to succeed, Von der Pool whipped up nutritious vegan smoothies and tossed plenty of hearty veggies in the drinks as a way to “trick” the tennis pro, though they took a little getting used to.
When I first started, Serena would pour out the green juices into the plants and act like she was drinking it.
Serena is so funny, she’s the absolute best, but she’s just also like a mischievous child,” Von der Pool recalls.What followed was a “serious conversation” between the pair, in which Von der Pool pointed out that, at that time, Serena wasn’t playing to the best of her ability.
Once I said that to her, she got serious and was just eating and drinking everything I gave her,” Von der Pool says.
And that’s when she really started to see the difference.
She understood that and she started to really make that shift.”Case in point: During thatBon Appétitchat, Serena noted that her refrigerator was packed with vegan smoothie staples such as “coconut water, Gatorade (my favorite!
 cucumbers, mint, kale, vegetables, ginger, and wheatgrass.”The lighthearted trickery extended to Venus, too, and was made possible thanks to some bold plant-based flavors.
Venus normally hates spinach, but I make a sesame spinach salad that she loves,” Von der PooltoldCooking Lightin 2013.
I use ingredients like sesame oil and mix in different flavors—plum vinegars, curries.
Food that’s flavored beautifully won’t be a chore to eat.”Von der Pool echoed that sentiment in her chat with LIVEKINDLY, reiterating that she’s not above tricking clients who might be wary of sampling vegan dishes.
I don’t even make a big deal of it.
If your food is bomb, [it doesn’t matter,]” she explains.
I don’t tell them what’s in it, and I give them things that they’re familiar with.”Speaking of familiarity, Von der Pool also wants her food to tug at something a bit deeper when she’s working with clients, and strives to make sure that every meal isn’t just about satiating hunger.
I really like to get into who each person is.
Once I know their background, what they like, what their grandma or mother liked to feed them—all those nostalgic points—I give them what they love,” she continues.
Then I ease in all the juices and the herbs and all of those different things.
I don’t make it a big deal.”Serena has said some of her favorite foods are her mom’s chicken, with rice and gravy and gumbo.
In addition to making vegan versions of those dishes, Von der Pool threw together other plant-based staples like vegan sushi and a plant-based tuna wrap made with walnuts.While Von der Pool notes there were some other “little” tweaks, she credits vegan food for vastly improving Serena’s tennis game.
And the superstar’s record (and rapid improvement) speaks for itself.
After a rough patch that lasted about three years and included a series of potentially career-ending injuries, Serena returned to the top of women’s tennis in 2013—within months of starting her work with Von der Pool.
Since then, Serena has won dozens of matches, including numerous Grand Slam titles.https://www.instagram.com/p/BVNUxbtFQ0M/Making veganism accessible to allThough Von der Pool acknowledges that working for and with celebrities and people in power is wonderful she wants to do more and make vegan food and the vegan lifestyle more accessible.
With that in mind she founded her nonprofit, Von Der Pool Healthy Living Services, and the Fresh City Kids movement.
Both initiatives strive to improve mind, body and soul through food choices and healthy lifestyle change.The Fresh City Kids movement is aimed at young people and includes Washington.
D.C.-based Fresh City Kids camp, which teaches youngsters about the importance of healthy eating.
In 2017, Von der Pool authored theFresh City Kids Recipe Book, which contains vegan recipes inspired by many of the campers.On a larger scale, Von der Pool was also asked to serve as an executive chef for former First Lady Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move” childhood obesity prevention campaign in 2009.
In that role, she encouraged youngsters to stay active and eat healthy, with a particular focus on whole fruits and vegetables.“If I can’t bring this to the people who might not ever have access to the Olympics or Wimbledon or the White House or anything like that, I’m still not doing my job correctly,” she shares.
That’s all great and I feel like working with people on the high level is excellent because they have influence over the masses, but then it’s also getting into that grassroots, going into the community and making real-life shifts, that’s also super important to me.”Van der Pool has also lobbied to get the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act passed in the United States in 2010, and, just as she did after her near-death experience at 16, believes healthy, vegan eating is crucial.
This is going to help to heal the entire planet just by something as simple as what we’re eating.
It seems so simple, but this is why I chose food, because people want to make a change,” she concludes.
I think this is the most gangster change you could ever make.
You’ll be happier.
You actually feel better.”Samantha LefflerJoin the waitlist for updates and premium membership opportunities.Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Sign UpJoin UsSign up for updates and membership opportunities.Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Sign UpJoin UsSign up for updates and membership opportunities.Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Sign UpJoin UsSign up for updates and membership opportunities.Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Sign UpCopyright 2023 ©LIVEKINDLYJoin UsContactReadWooCommerce not Found

Horst,Vogue, June 1975FoodHow I Conquered the Kitchen and Finally Started Cooking for MyselfByChristian AllaireJanuary 25, 2019FacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryFacebookTwitterPinterestSave StoryWhen I was in high school, my parents tasked me with something simple: for once in my life, I would have to cook for myself.
They were heading out, and my older sister, who usually whipped me up some Kraft Dinner in their absence, wasn't home either.
There’s a pizza in the fridge,” my dad said, telling me I should just follow the directions, which were basically: plop it in the oven and set a timer.
What could go wrong?Cut to about an hour later, when a massive blaze ignited in the kitchen.
While I was taking the pie out, it inexplicably slipped out of my grasp and flipped face-down onto the hottest part of the oven, creating a momentary—though terrifyingly large—fire.
Screaming ensued.
Water was thrown.
Luckily our house did not burn down, but my culinary hopes went up in flames along with the pepperoni and cheese.A decade later, not much has changed.
Living in New York, the need for cooking is basically nonexistent: at the push of a button, delivery is at my doorstep faster than I can say “sushi.” And when I’m not ordering takeout, I’m dining out.
Hell, I’ve lived in the same apartment for four years now and my gas oven isstill not hooked up.But what once was a cute aversion to the kitchen is now downright embarrassing.
It’s 2019: I'm now in my mid-twenties, and one of my New Year’s resolutions is to just be a better adult.
At this age, there’s no excuse for not knowing the difference between broil and cook (until recently, I had zero clue).
Plus, my eating out every single night has definitely not done any favors for my financial state.
But could I actually learn to cook on my own?Over the past 6 months, I've risked disaster and ventured into the kitchen, learning skills that translate across recipes, and basics I can repeat every week.
Here's how I did it:1.
Start easyI’ve learned to put my lofty goals aside and start with the easy-peasy dishes.
There’s no better way to quash a desire to learn something new than by starting with something difficult," says Anita Lo, a chef and author ofSolo: A Modern Cookbook for a Party of One.
The immediate satisfaction of a quick, simple, and delicious dish will whet your appetite for more.
Pasta, for instance,has been a safe space.
After a few failed attempts—forgetting to salt the water, for instance—I’m now comfortable getting my noodle consistency just right, and even find it fun experimenting with different sauces and ingredients.
I’m a big fan of one-pan recipes, such as this onefrom Martha Stewart.2.
Be strategicIf Iamgoing to cook at home, I want to make something that will ensure I have leftovers for the following day (or two).
I also want to make it as seamless a process as possible—I’m all about minimum effort, maximum results.
The best chefs use their heads just as much, if not more, than their physical beings," says Lo.
Read your recipes first and orchestrate the timing—generally, it's good to start with what takes the longest so you’re not waiting around for it to finish when you’re done with everything else."
Taking that in mind, I’ve ventured into the confusing land of meal prep, and being more strategic about buying ingredients that will be versatile for the week ahead.
Turns out, it’s not so hard.
Cooking a steak or chicken, for instance—something I’ve only done maybe twice, but successfully!—can ensure that I can have a healthy portion of meat one day.
The next, I can slice the rest into strips for fajitas.3.
Take a classOne of the benefits of living in New York is there is no shortage of cooking classes.
Though I cringe at the fact that I nowmust payto learn when, for years, my dad—who is an amazing cook—tried to get me more involved in the kitchen.)
There are classes you can sign up for, or you can even get an app like Panna, which will give you a demo of specific dishes," says Lo.
Most recently, I’ve actually switched things up and taken a baking class, something I discovered I actually really, really like.
The required precision is something I find much more relaxing than the improvisation that goes into cooking.4.
Cook with friendsPart of the reason I’ve put off cooking for so long is because the effort, money, and time it takes to create a meal simply doesn’t match my solo lifestyle.
I am single and live alone—you will not find me creating a decadent five-course menu just for myself.
But, I’ve learned that cooking a big feast with friends is a fun way to learn, while not feeling so sad about having nobody to share it with.
Cue the violins, I know.)
Food creates community," says Lo, "and by cooking with others, you have a team you can confer with and eat with—and, of course, pass the blame if anything goes wrong.

Set a goalBeing a deadline-driven person, I simply will not do something unless I have a solid plan and schedule in place.
I’ve learned to set a goal for my cooking: make meals at home at least a quarter of the week.
This may seem a low goal to someone who cooks almost every day—but remember, I’m still in beginner mode.
Too big a commitment and I’ll end up blowing it off altogether.
Sure, you could yo-yo between being an at-home cook or going-out diner—or you can follow a realistic, attainable diet of cooking at home for yourself," says Lo.
Plus, I’ve taken smaller steps, too: something as simple as making an avocado toast for myself in the morning still counts, not mention saves my bank account from those marked-up chocolate croissants that I love to buy on my way to work way too often.In short: am I the next Daniel Boulud?
But I'm making progress towards a future I never thought I could achieve; using my kitchen and saving money without starting any fires.
Because, yes, I finally hooked up my oven.

The little-known story of Serena Williams’ first endorsement deal — AndscapeSkip to contentAndscapeTwitterFacebookTennisThe little-known story of Serena Williams’ first endorsement dealHow Puma helped transform a 16-year-old tennis phenom into a ‘fashion icon’ByAaron DodsonSeptember 24, 2021ESPN ILLUSTRATIONAntonio Bertone can’t forget that fateful day he met the quiet young girl who changed everything.It was the fall of 1997, one evening in Los Angeles, where Bertone, then in his mid-20s, worked as a global director of brand management for the German sportswear company Puma.At the time, Regency Enterprises held the claim as Puma’s principal shareholder.
The mastermind of that unique union of entertainment, footwear and apparel was Regency founder Arnon Milchan, a successful business executive from Israel who became the high-profile film producer behind blockbusters such asPretty Woman(1990),JFK(1991) andL.A.
Confidential(1997).
Milchan always thought big picture and had one secretly ambitious plan for Puma, surrounding his off-screen obsession with tennis.“I got a call from Arnon’s assistant,” Bertone remembered.
She said, ‘Hey, can you come over to the studio tonight around 5 or 6 o’clock?
Arnon wants you to join this meeting.’ I was like, ‘OK.
Any idea of what the meeting is about?’ She said, ‘I have no idea.’ ”Around 5:30 p.m., Bertone arrived at Milchan’s office, then located on the lot of Warner Bros. Studios.
The meeting had lasted since midday.“Sitting in the office is Serena Williams,” he recalled.
I don’t think she was even 16 yet.”Related StoryVenus and Serena made history at the Australian Open 20 years ago that’s often forgottenRead nowWilliams, who turns 40 this week, would go on to endorse Puma into her early 20s, wearing custom-designed outfits that made her into a revolutionary of tennis fashion.
But her ongoing 18-year partnership with Nike, the brand she’d join in 2003, has overshadowed the oft-forgotten first endorsement deal of her career.
It all began, for Williams, with an offer from Puma, negotiated in this meeting.Next to her in the room sat Richard Williams, who moved his family from Saginaw, Michigan, to Compton, California, in 1983.
He taught the game of tennis on the city’s public courts to his daughters, Venus and Serena, who are 15 months apart.Milchan had met his ultimate match in Richard Williams.
The self-proclaimed “James Bond” (who once said that hecovertly negotiated arms dealsfor the Israeli government in the 1960s) took serve against “King Richard,” the hands-on father who leveraged his elder daughter, Venus, aneight-figure endorsement deal with Reebokin 1995.
That same year, Williams turned pro at 14, joining her sister on the WTA tour.“Arnon recognized Serena and Venus’ ability to change the sport of tennis,” Bertone said.
Puma wasn’t in tennis then.
But Arnon went from 0 to 100 … like, ‘We’re totally getting back into tennis with Serena.’ ”Technically, Milchan didn’t have the power to discuss financial terms on Puma’s behalf.
And Bertone didn’t have the authority to offer a multiyear contract to an athlete.
So they called Puma CEO Jochen Zeitz in Germany.
Zeitz woke up in the middle of the night to sign off on the deal.
Back in the corner of the LA office, Richard Williams periodically called his wife Oracene on the room’s landline to provide updates.
I was convinced he wasn’t even talking to her,” Bertone noted.
That he was just buying time, drawing things out to see where we’d end up.”At one point, as detailed in her2009 autobiography,On The Line, Williams placed her head down on the conference table and dozed off.
Negotiations went past midnight, lasting more than 12 hours.
The meeting ultimately ended with a multimillion-dollar commitment from Zeitz and Puma, and a verbal agreement from Richard and Serena Williams.“I could have signed with any sports brand, but this was the most promising and felt right for me.”—16-year-old Serena Williams in 1998“It was really hard to imagine how her career would evolve,” Bertone said.
But you had to believe, right?
It was like, ‘We’re gonna do this.’ At the same time, I kept on going into these obsessive, compulsive loops in my head … like, ‘How the f— are we gonna figure this out?’ ”Williams, now with 23 Grand Slam singles titles to her legacy, has since been transformed into one of the most admired — and scrutinized — athletes of all time in sport and style.
But in the late ’90s, both Puma and a young Williams had much to prove.“I wanted a sponsor.
I wanted someone to believe in me,” wrote Williams inOn The Line.
It wasn’t just Puma taking a chance on me.
It was me taking a chance on Puma.
It cut both ways.”A week or so after that initial meeting, a large package addressed to Williams arrived at her family’s home in Florida.
She opened it and tried on everything inside, gaining validation extending beyond how each outfit appeared in the mirror.
It was about more than just the free clothes or even her first endorsement deal.“It was this moment,” she wrote inOn The Line, “going through this giant box of Puma gear that all fit perfectly, where I felt I’d finally arrived as a player.”By February 1998, approximately five months after negotiations on the Warner Bros. lot, Puma officially announced its partnership with a 16-year-old Serena, then the No.
41-ranked women’s singles player in the world.“I could have signed with any sports brand, but this was the most promising and felt right for me,” Williams said at the time.
Due to scheduling, Williams declined The Undefeated’s request to be interviewed for this story.
The unprecedented agreement not only included her promotion of the company’s sportswear products, but also said that she would “participate in various film, music and media projects produced by Regency,” according toThe Hollywood Reporter.Spoiler: Regency never landed Williams on the silver screen (even though theLos Angeles Timesreported in March 1999 that she and her sister completed screen tests for an undisclosed film).
But Puma certainly delivered in fostering the tennis phenom’s passion for design.
Williams made sure she made the most out of the partnership in that regard.Related StoryTracking Serena Williams’ journey through picturesRead nowFor her first meeting with Alden Sheets, who became president of worldwide apparel at Puma in 1997, Williams came prepared.
She gave him a handwritten note and outfit sketches she drew herself while on tour.“Alden,” wrote Williams, who, at 16, had her own custom-branded letterhead, adorned with her first and last name at the top of each page.
Here are some of the designs that I have thought of.
There were many more but this requires many late nights and hard work, especially during a tournament.” On two sheets of paper, Williams outlined her vision for on-court apparel she called the “Petal” and “Mod” series.
She traced concepts for jackets, dresses, biker shorts and pants that she filled in with colored pencils and added explanatory notes.“As I said before,” she continued, “Puma is behind in a lot of ways.
And I believe I can help bring the company back to its feet and into the lead once again.”Remember, Puma didn’t have a presence in tennis when the company signed her.
More than a decade had passed since Boris Becker and Martina Navratilova last repped the brand on the court.
We exited tennis in the ’80s, vowing to never get back,” said Bertone, who would become Puma’s chief marketing officer before leaving the company in 2012.
Yet Puma returned with Williams.
She was an athlete — from her background to the frame of her body and the way she moved — unlike any other the brand had experienced.“I saw her and Venus play doubles at Wimbledon.
These amazing, powerful women of color in sport,” said Amy Denet Deal, a former senior women’s designer for Puma, who is Native American.
Being a woman of color, it was groundbreaking to see that shift.”Then overseeing a design office in Herzogenaurach, Germany, where the company is headquartered, Deal received the assignment of being Williams’ first lead designer.
Puma also paired Williams with Linda Long, a former tennis player-turned-marketing director who operated as a daily brand manager, traveling with her on tour.
Deal and Williams first met at a tournament in Indian Wells, California, and bonded over a shared love for apparel in eye-catching colors.
Williams gave Deal drawings depicting what she dreamed of wearing on the court.“I just thought that was the coolest thing ever that this young woman showed up with a bunch of sketches,” said Deal, now the owner and creative director of a design consulting firm and sustainable upcycling brand.
You’re talking about someone who was 17 and had no training in design.
She wanted to be the most powerful player.
But this effortless sense of style that she’s developed over all these years — that was in her heart.”A few weeks after 17-year-old Serena Williams won her first career Grand Slam singles title at the 1999 US Open, the dress she wore in the tournament was released at the country’s first Puma store that opened in Santa Monica, California.Simon Bruty/Sports Illustrated/Getty ImagesDeal designed the yellow dress Williams wore when she won the US Open in September 1999 after upsetting world No.
1 Martina Hingis, 6-3, 7-6, in straight sets.
At 17, she became the first African American woman to claim a Grand Slam singles title since Althea Gibson in 1958.
She also won the tournament’s women’s doubles title with her sister Venus.
Puma celebrated Williams’ first career major singles victory with a $500,000 bonus.
And a few weeks later, her tennis coronation gown hit the rack at the first Puma store in the United States, which opened in Santa Monica, California.“Head-to-toe yellow,” Deal said.
Quite different from what would be expected.
It was so beautiful.
Back when she first started playing and had all the beads in her hair, she was always matching them with her outfit.”Her career-long catalog of on-court outfits considered, Williams’ Puma dress from the 1999 US Open is relatively tame.
It took some time for her to get comfortable with the brand as she grew into a young woman.She turned 18.
She transitioned from beaded braids to new hairstyles.
She announced a joint plan with her sister Venus for offseason enrollment at the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale, where they would major in fashion.
And, most importantly, she started winning.
By the end of 1999, she ranked No.
4 in the world in women’s singles.“Our eye was always on majors,” Sheets said.
Every major, there would be a new series of apparel and a statement outfit.
We started conservatively.
Then we started to get wild.”A young designer named Bonnie Dominguez, who specialized in lifestyle clothing, took over as the visionary behind Williams’ apparel after Deal left the company in November 1999.
Closer to Williams in age, Dominguez and the tennis star clicked immediately.
Williams nicknamed the 5-foot-2 Dominguez “Little Bonnie.”“Serena was always the muse,” said Dominguez, who designed for Puma from 1998 to 2005.
She’s been with New Balance since 2013.
I don’t know if that could’ve happened with any other player — to take that many fashion risks that early in a career.
I don’t think the world was ready for it.
I don’t think design was ready for it.”In 2000, classes at the Art Institute started for Williams, who was deemed the “single-most recognizable athlete Puma endorses worldwide” inThe Palm Beach Postby the brand’s head of U.S. marketing.
She also began addressing her outfits in news conferences, while opening up more about her lifelong love of fashion.
Williams quipped, however, that design didn’t come to her as naturally as tennis.“I like drawing ideas of things to wear and just, like, sketching out things,” she said in 2000.
I’m not the greatest artist, but I’ve got ideas.”Ahead of the 2000 US Open, Sheets discovered a new type of fabric and a factory in LA that could manipulate it through a unique tie-dyeing process.
He challenged Dominguez to use his findings in her debut ensemble for Williams to wear at that season’s final major.The purple tie-dye coverup Serena Williams wore at the 2000 US Open was the first in a line of outfits made for her by then-Puma designer Bonnie Dominguez.PL Gould/Images/Getty Images“One of the first outfits that got the most attention was Williams’ purple and black tie-dye coverup,” Sheets said.
She had a pair of compression shorts underneath a bare midriff and bra top.
So, at various angles, you were seeing through that garment, because it was mesh.
That outfit had the WTA calling me to question what we were doing to tennis, which was a very white, conservative sport.”The policing of Williams’ style started early in her career.
Notably at Wimbledon, tennis’ most revered Grand Slam, where there’s aNo.
1 rule: Competitors must be dressed in suitable tennis attire that is almost entirely white.During Williams’ five-year partnership with Puma, certain tournaments began mandating that the brand show Williams’ outfits in advance.
Sheets fielded frequent calls from tennis officials, including one that still stands out from the All England Club, where Williams won Wimbledon singles titles in 2002 and 2003.“I remember I was on a shopping tour, walking the streets of Florence and my cellphone rings,” recalled Sheets.
It was the head of the Wimbledon approval committee saying, ‘Mr.
Sheets, we’re very concerned Serena’s outfits will be outside of the ethics of our organization.
We’d very much like to see what you’re planning to have her wear.
In fact, send the garments to us for our pre-approval before she’s allowed to be on court.’“I was stunned,” Sheets continued.
The people at Wimbledon were worried we were gonna put Serena out there in a red outfit or something.
We wanted to.
But we knew we couldn’t get it done.
Not there.”Puma truly flipped the script of traditional tennis attire at the French Open in 2002.
The tournament was held during the first two weeks of the FIFA World Cup in South Korea.
The marketing team at the brand, which also sponsored Cameroon’s national men’s soccer team, came up with the crazy concept of outfitting Williams in a dress resembling the kit the African nation would wear at the World Cup.
Dominguez sketched a sample and pitched it to Williams, who loved the idea.
In her opening match at the French Open, she took the court in Cameroon-themed apparel, down to a pair of yellow soccer socks pulled up to her knees.A computer-aided design of the outfit Serena Williams broke out in the first round of the 2002 French Open.
The look was inspired by the Puma kits the Cameroonian men’s national soccer team wore at the FIFA World Cup that year.PUMAAfter Williams won the French Open and at Wimbledon in 2002, Puma needed another head-turning design for the 21-year-old star, who had reached the world No.
1 in women’s singles.
She was preparing to compete for her third straight Grand Slam title at the US Open.“With her pushing so many style boundaries, it was like, ‘What do we do next?’ ” Dominguez remembers thinking.
Does it have to be a skirt?
Does it have to be a dress?”A better question, she asked herself: “How do we make a statement?”Sketches and design materials were sprawled across her hotel room in Germany as Dominguez prepared for a sales meeting to introduce what she had in store for Williams.From the television in the background, Dominguez heard speculation that actress Halle Berry was being cast as the lead in the filmCatwoman.
She turned around and watched the program roll vintage footage of the actress Eartha Kitt, who in 1967 became the first African American woman to star as the comic book character in the TV seriesBatman.It was in this moment that Dominguez found inspiration for Williams’ infamous catsuit that she’d debut months later at the 2002 US Open.At the US Open on Aug. 26, 2002, Serena Williams debuted her controversial catsuit, made with faux-leather spandex.
Williams is now known for a collection of Nike catsuits she’s worn on the court in recent years.
But Puma designed her first one nearly two decades ago.Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images“I don’t think anyone else would’ve looked good in that catsuit,” said Dominguez, who immediately got to drawing after “badass Eartha Kitt” reminded her of Williams.
For the outfit, she planned to use Lycra, a high-shine spandex brand that looked like faux leather and would tightly hug Williams’ muscular physique.
Dominguez complemented the look with a biker-style jacket that she could wear over the catsuit while warming up.“ ‘Let’s try it,’ ” recalled Dominguez of the customary approval Williams gave to move a design concept into production.
By the time Sheets delivered a sample at a memorable 7 a.m. fitting session in her hotel room at the Beverly Hills Four Seasons, Williams had forgotten about the rebellious outfit.“Serena’s legacy with Puma feels like it all got erased when she went to Nike.”— Antonio Bertone, former chief marketing officer for Puma“We hand her the catsuit and she says, ‘This is for me … to wear playing tennis?’ ” Sheets recalled.
She went into the bathroom and came out where there was a full mirror in front of the door.
She was just glowing, with this huge grin on her face.”At the sight of Williams in the catsuit for the first time, Sheets’ split conscience spoke up.“I remember very specifically having two guys on my shoulders.
One on my left and one on my right,” Sheets said.
The one on my left said, ‘You are absolutely crazy if you’re gonna have her walk out at the US Open, upset the USTA, the WTA and have Puma scrutinized.
 You can’t allow this.’“The one on my right said,‘This is the most incredible thing we’ve ever done.
We’re gonna upset all of tennis.
We’re gonna upset the entire world.
The press is gonna be all over this.
And Serena loves it.
We’re not turning back at this point.’ ”Due to delays at a factory in China, the catsuit almost didn’t make it in time for the US Open.
At the 11th hour, a Puma representative flew the garment from Hong Kong to New York, where Sheets picked it up at the airport.
He handed it off to Long, Williams’ brand manager, who gave it to her and advised she try it on before her opening match at the US Open.“I had to beg Jim Curley, who was the tournament director then, to allow Serena to wear it.
He thought I’d lost my mind but gave the OK,” Long said.
I’m standing in the hallway waiting for Serena to come out to go on to Arthur Ashe Stadium court in the catsuit.
She bends over and whispers in my ear, ‘This is the first time I’ve put this catsuit on … hope I don’t lose.’ ”On Aug. 26, 2002, Williams stepped onto the tennis court and unzipped her jacket to unveil her skintight catsuit.
Later that evening, this is how CNN anchor Anderson Cooper opened the program:“Good evening, everyone.
We faced a bitterly divisive issue at our afternoon meeting today.
 Now, we could lie and say the fight was whether to invade Iraq or not.
 No, today’s tiff was about females and fashion.
 We’re talking about tennis supernova Serena Williams and the controversy over the catsuit.”Despite widespread criticism, Williams went on to win the 2002 US Open, defeating her sister Venus while wearing the outfit that she accented in the final match with a pink headband and armband.“Man, that outfit turned a lot of heads …,” wrote Williams years later inOn The Line.
But what most people don’t realize is it was so comfortable!
Of course the catsuit was so hot I would have worn it even if it was the most uncomfortable thing in the world.”It doesn’t feel like common knowledge that Puma designed the first catsuit Williams wore in her career.
Type “Serena catsuit” in Google, and the first images and news stories that surface are those surrounding the Nike one she wore at the French Open in 2018 that the French Tennis Federation barred from returning, saying “one must respect the game.” Nike responded to the ban and comments by releasing an ad with the powerful tagline: “You can take a superhero out of her costume, but you can never take away her superpowers.”“Serena’s legacy with Puma feels like it all got erased when she went to Nike,” Bertone said.Related StoryBlack women are taking over the footwear industryRead nowIn December 2003, after winning her first six Grand Slam singles titles while repping Puma, Williams left the company to join Nike on an eight-year endorsement dealreported to be worth up to $55 millionwith performance incentives.
By comparison, Williams earned areported $13 million from Pumain the first five years of her career.
Dominguez recalled that Williams never had the opportunity to wear the final outfit she designed for her.
So Puma outfitted actress Kirsten Dunst in it for the 2004 filmWimbledon.
At the time, we went as high as we could go for an athlete, knowing full well that Nike would outbid us,” Bertone said.
People nowadays have no idea about Serena and Puma.”There’s a memory in particular that Bertone cherishes from Williams’ early days with Puma.
In the late ’90s, they crossed paths at the Atlanta Super Show, a sporting goods trade convention.“I remember seeing her and shaking her hand, like, ‘Holy s—.
You’re a superstar now,’ ” Bertone recalled.
She had become a young woman and was much taller than the first time I saw her.
She was wearing all her Puma apparel and it was just so nice to be like, ‘This is working!’ ”She’s since gone from a promising 16-year-old athlete a brand took a chance on to reaching the pinnacle of both tennis and style-bending.“I consider her a fashion icon,” said Deal, the first designer of color Williams worked with at Puma.
She’s completely changed the way that women dress for sport.”In 2019, Williams and Nike teamed up to create anapprenticeship program to promote diversityin design and provide a foundation for a new generation of designers from underrepresented backgrounds.
In August, Nike announced the Serena Williams Design Crew’s first collection, set for a fall release, featuring apparel, footwear and accessories and crafted by 10 designers from diverse backgrounds.Now, it seems, Williams is the one on the receiving end of a young aspiring designer’s sketches.Aaron Dodson is a sports and culture writer at Andscape.

And with help fromNike, that’s only going to continue.For instance, Nike and Williams created theSerena Williams Design Crew designapprenticeship program in 2019 to promote diversity in design and establish a new generation of design talent at Nike and beyond.
In January 2020, the first group of young talents visited the brand’s headquarters in Beaverton, Ore., and worked for six months to produce footwear, apparel and accessories inspired by the tennis icon in the worlds of performance and lifestyle product.
Since then, the program has only advanced.Tanya Hvizdak, VP of global women’s sports marketing at Nike, told FN that Nike currently has 13 apprentices in the program from Williams’ hometown of Compton, Calif.“Serena is extremely passionate about design.
And she’s also passionate about providing opportunities to groups that maybe haven’t necessarily been afforded those platforms.
And through our partnership, she saw an opportunity to give designers, young people, passionate in that space, the opportunity to work with an incredible organization and elevate them.
It’s allowed for a new group of diverse individuals into our organization to really help push and bring new thought and experience into that space,” explained Hvizdak.Williams was also a central force in the launch of one of Nike’s most far-reaching platforms in years, The Nike Athlete Think Tank.
Through this initiative, athletes are able to provide unfiltered feedback about their unique journeys and the changes they wanted to see regarding financial aspect of creating access to sport, inclusion and community efforts, among other topics.“She was part of that first inaugural crew.
And that really laid the foundation.
I’m excited to say that we’re in our second cohort.
And Serena has expressed interest in continuing to be involved,” said Hvizdak.Last month, Williams covered Vogue’s September issue where she announced her plans in a verbal essay with the magazine.
I’m here to tell you that I’m evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me,” she said.Hvizdak is excited about what the future holds.
The thing that’s most incredible is just she transcends sport.
The amount of decades and generations that she’s been able to impact is just absolutely incredible.
And I think what she’ll continue to bring will be even more impactful.
And she spoke to that a little bit when she was talking about her retirement and how she’s excited about what the evolution of Serena means,” Hvizdak said.Hvizdak added that the tennis star’s authenticity and unapologetic self has connected with consumers through the years and continues to do so today.“Serena is so integral into the push that we’ve seen.
She’s showing what’s possible, whether it’s Serena Ventures or the SWDC, she continues to break glass ceilings.
And that’s where you see us as a brand continuing to lean in.
We continue to say that sport has the ability to move the world forward.
And in Serena, she just exemplifies that.”Read More About:NikeSerena WilliamsNewsletterBreaking NewsThe KickerThe Morning LeadYour EmailSign UpThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.More From Our BrandsVarietyPrison Drama ‘Time’ Sets Season 2 With New Cast Including Bella Ramsey, Jodie WhittakerRolling StoneJeremy Renner Declared ‘Toughest Avenger’ on KimmelArtNewsHong Kong’s M+ Museum Is Giving Away 10,000 Tickets to Its Blockbuster Kusama ShowBGRAvengers: Secret Wars: Release date, cast, trailers, & everything we knowDirtFrank Lloyd Wright’s One-of-a-Kind Circular Sun House Lists in ArizonaSporticoAbout UsAccessibilityAdvertiseLegalTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyCalifornia Privacy RightsAdChoicesPrivacy PreferencesYour Privacy ChoicesSitemapBusinessLawLeaguesPersonalitiesValuationsSubscriptionsLog InCustomer ServiceConnect with UsGet our latest stories in the feed of your favorite networksIcon LinkIcon LinkIcon LinkIcon LinkHave a Tip?We want to hear from you!

After debuting back in 1995, the American athlete has conquered all before her and remains one of the most important players on the court.Williams is up there withRoger Federer, Rafael Nadal, andNovak Djokovicwith her dominance.
A sports person this great also happens to have fine taste in cars.
Serena William's car collection has a wide variety of cars ranging from SUVs to luxury saloons, tosports cars.She seems to have a soft spot for British cars as her collection contains not one, but three Brits - that includes a Bentley, an Aston Martin, and even a Mini.
And now, withSerena Williams announcing her retirement from tennis, she has a lot of time to enjoy her sweet rides; and even add some new cars to the collection.Updated August 2022: Since Serena Williams is retiring from tennis, she is going to get more time to spend with her beloved cars.
We have updated this article with the latest information about her vibrant car collection.With such a haul of trophies to her name, let's take a look at the other bright and shiny things in her life; Serena Williams' car collection.RELATED:Roger Federer's Car Collection Is A Total AceSerena Owns A Lincoln NavigatorWilliams became a brand ambassador for the Lincoln Navigator in 2018, which has seen the tennis star behind the wheel of the luxury SUV.
Aligning herself with the Navigator was actually a blast from the past for Williams, whose very first car was also the famous car.Williams loved that car and gave it the nickname 'Ginger' before passing it over to her niece as a gift after eight years behind the wheel.
The Grand Slam superstar is now back in control of her beloved SUV, albeit a more modern version.Sports stars are the envy of their fans as not only do they get to play the sport they love for a living, but they also get amazing sponsorship deals like this.
Brands will clamor to get the best athletes' faces next to their products, and it's a win-win for these superstars.Serena Loves Her MiniElite athletes spend a lot of their time in the spotlight.
They can hold the gaze of thousands of fans at an arena and millions more who are watching at home.
There is a lot of pressure on a professional sports star to live exemplary lives, but it's worth remembering that they are people too.Williams' 2016Mini Countrymanwas made famous in 2017 after she was pulled over by the police for a speeding infringement.
Getting caught speeding isn't that uncommon, as sometimes we're running a little late, and we need to put the pedal to the metal.
Unlike your average Joe, when Williams was caught speeding, it became national news.Serena Adorns Her Aston Martin VanquishAs we mentioned already, being a world-famous sports star has its benefits.
Before Williams was a brand ambassador for Lincoln, she was the face of Aston Martin.
Being the face of such a famous luxury sports car brand came with the perks most gearheads can only dream about, getting an Aston Martin for free.Williams gained control ofthe 5.9-liter V12 Vanquishuntil she switched allegiance to Lincoln in 2018.
The Vanquish is a perfect blend of power and style, something that compliments the way Williams approaches her tennis career.Williams is known for her powerful approach to playing tennis, but while she's on the court, she also considers style to be an important aspect.
Besides being one of the all-time greats, Williams is also known as one of the most stylish tennis players on the circuit.RELATED:10 Cool Facts Everyone Forgot About Aston Martin's Sports CarsSerena Williams Has A Bentley Continental GTAlexander Migl Via Wikimedia CommonsIt would seem that Williams looks for luxury above most other characteristics when getting behind the wheel of a new car.
The multiple Grand Slam winner is one of the highest-earning stars on tour, and she puts those winnings to good use with her car collection.With Williams conquering Wimbledon five times, it seems she has a lot of fun in Britain.
Perhaps that affinity for British soil has endeared theBentley Continental GTto Williams.
The Continental GT comes with a 4.0-liter V8 engine and maxes out at 198 mph.
Power and elegance are once again the standout characteristics of a Serena Williams car, this time, it's the one and only Bentley Continental GT.Serena Williams Rolls In A Mercedes-Benz G-WagonWagon Master 2.0 Via Wikimedia CommonsSerena Williams proved she wouldn't be eating other celebrities' dust when keeping up with the latest car trends.
The tennis superstar, like so many other wealthy and powerful people, gets behind the wheel ofa Mercedes G-Wagon.
Otherwise, known as the G-Class, this legendary SUV has been around since the 1970s in different guises until the current crop appeared in 1992.Although not always desirable, the G-Wagon has become popular thanks to stars like Williams, Kevin Hart, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Kylie Jenner.
Equipped with a 4.0-liter V8, the G-Class can handle just about anything you wish to throw at it.The SUV will get you from A to B in a hurry on the roads or make light work of any type of rough terrain you like.
No matter the situation, the G-Wagon remains pure luxury on the inside.
It means that even if her G-Class is caked in mud from a trip off-road, Williams can step onto the red carpet without missing a beat.Sources: Washingtonpost, Serena Williams Via InstagramShareTweetShareShareCopyEmailShareShareTweetShareShareCopyEmailLink copied to clipboardRelated TopicsFamous CollectionsCar CultureSports CarsAbout The AuthorConnor Doyle(86 Articles Published)Connor is a content writer and journalist from the UK with several years in the business.

She rode with NASCAR driver Kurt Busch, and afterward she seemed moved by the experience.What moved her the most?“The fact that they’re driving 200 mph behind each other and there’s like two inches that separate them,” she said.
And then if, they just, you know — it’s crazy.”Part of that insanity was Williams’ discovery that NASCAR steering wheels can be (easily) removed.
Reassured that the racecars have lots of protective features, she took a skeptical tone.“I guess it’s the safest car on the road,” she said, with a hint of sarcasm.
That’s one way of looking at it.”Williams and her sister, Venus, became tennis stars before they were even old enough to drive legally, so Serena’s car was not a typical teen’s first car.
Her first ride?
A BMW Z3.“It’s a two-seater,” she said.
I still have it.
I drive it fast.”How fast?“Not as fast as young Kurt [Busch],” she laughed.She allows that she has occasionally gone faster than authorities would like.
I’ve gotten a few speeding tickets in the past, but I try not to drive as fast any more.” This experience may reinforce that resolve.So, besides the Z3, what else is sitting in her garage?“I have a truck, a Cadillac truck,” Serena said.
I have a Range Rover Sport.“I’m an SUV kind of girl.”Fast Cars & Superstars Coverage on Cars.comOther Fast Cars & Superstars ProfilesGabrielle ReeceKasey KahneKurt BuschBill CowherJohn CenaTony HawkJohn ElwayLatest newsTesla’s Price-Cutting Streak Continues, New Base Model Y AddedApril 10, 2023How to Fix Rust on a CarApril  9, 2023What’s the Best New-Car Deal for April 2023?April  7, 2023See all latest newsLearn moreShop cars for sale near youResearch carsCompare vehiclesFeatured storiesNewsIs Now a Good Time to Buy a Used Car?By Jane UlitskayaMarch 31, 2023NewsWhat to Know Before Purchasing an Electric Vehicle: A Buying GuideBy Cars.com EditorsMarch 28, 2023Expert Review2023 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid Review: Good on Gas, Bad on NoiseBy Jennifer GeigerNews EditorLatest expert reviewsExpert Review2023 Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid Review: Less Slow, Still SteadyBy Brian NormileRoad Test EditorExpert Review2023 Toyota Prius Prime Review: Sportier for Sure, But Why?By Brian NormileRoad Test EditorExpert Review2024 Mazda CX-90 Review: More Than MainstreamBy Mike HanleySenior EditorBuying & SellingFind a CarFind a DealerListings by CityCertified Pre-OwnedCar Payment CalculatorsCar Reviews & RatingsCompare Side by SideFraud AwarenessSell Your CarExplore Our BrandNewCars.comDealerRaterFor DealersDealer LoginGrowWithCars.comFUELDealer InspireDealerRaterAccu-TradeOur CompanyAbout Cars.comContact Cars.comInvestor RelationsCareersLicensing & ReprintsSite MapFeedbackOur Mobile AppDownload the App TodayConnect With UsTerms & Conditions of UsePrivacy NoticeCalifornia Privacy NoticeDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAccessibility StatementAd Choices©

But what rises above their storied rivalry?
Friendship, of course.5minByNick McCarvelTennisFew sports rivalries stretch into two decades in length.
Even fewer involve two siblings who call one another “best friend.”But both of those things (and much more) ring true fortennismegastarsVenusandSerena Williams, the pair of sisters who have captured 30 Grand Slam singles titles between them, as well as nine Olympic medals.“The best part is (that) we bring out the best in each other,” Serenatold reportersduring the US Open in 2018.
I know when I play her, I have to play some of my best tennis.
She does, too.
 I feel like throughout our career, we have pushed each other to be the best that we can be… and be Venus and Serena Williams.”Women's Doubles Final - Tennis | London 2012 ReplaysIn August of 2020, the Williams sisterswent head-to-headfor a 31st time at the WTA stop in Lexington, Kentucky, a match that Serena won 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.
It was a first even for the Williams sisters: Playing in front of no fans due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
It's never easy," Serena told reporters about facing her sister after the win.Here are five things you may not have known about their rivalry, which started way back in January of 1998, when they met in the second round of the Australian Open – when both were still teens.Four decades in the makingIt’s Serena who leads their head-to-head 19-12in their 31 clashes, but the first belonged to older sister Venus, 7-6(4), 6-1, back in the day when the sisters still wore beads in their hair during matches.
Remember that?!
Today would have been great fun if it were a final, but it wasn’t so fun to eliminate my little sister in the second round,”Venus said in 1998.They haven’t slowed down since, meeting throughout the 2000s and 2010s.
Their busiest period was 2008-09, when they played nine times in two years, including in two Wimbledon finals.Setting records every step of the wayWhile many argue their story is one of the most compelling in all of sports, the Compton, California-raised sisters became the first siblings to meet for a Grand Slam singles title in the Open Era when they played in the 2001 US Open championship match.Between 2002 and 2003, they would clash in four consecutive major finals, including the French Open, Wimbledon, US and Australian Opens, becoming the first two women to meet back-to-back-to-back-to-back.
Serena won all four of those matches, marking her first of two “Serena Slam” runs.Their numbers are mind-boggling:30 singles Slams between them: 23 for Serena; seven for VenusNine Olympic medals, including eight gold and three in doubles: 2000, 2008 and 201214 doubles majors togetherA combined 330 weeks at world No.1: 11 weeks for Venus; Serena the restUSD $134.5 million combined prize money (not to mention endorsement deals)And an immeasurable global reach for their sport: Go anywhere in the world and say “Venus and Serena” – their names are synonymous with tennis.Hey, you look familiar…While tennis greatsMartina NavratilovaandChris Everthave met on the singles court more than any other duo in the Open Era (80 times!
 Venus has never played anyone more than Serena – and the same goes for Serena with Venus.“I want to play the best players and I think I got my wish in playing Serena,” Venus said this week.
So here we go.”While Serena maintains the head-to-head edge, they’ve produced some classics, going toe-to-toe in nine major finals.
Their 2003 Australian Open final was particularly close, Serena winning 7-6(4), 3-6, 6-4.
But many fans point to their 2008 US Open quarter-final as their most compelling, a high-quality 7-6(6), 7-6(7) triumph for Serena.
She’d go on to hoist the trophy that fortnight.Rivals, siblings, partnersWhile their rivalry has carried through on the singles court, they’ve maintained just as long-lasting of a doubles partnership, as well, most notably on the Olympic stage.In 2000, the sisters made their Olympic debut with resounding success, Venus winning the singles and then teaming up with Serena for the doubles.
It was the first time since 1924 that a woman had won both the singles and doubles (Helen Wills Moodydid it back in the day) in tennis.
Serena would match her sis in 2012, going golden in both singles and doubles on the courts of Wimbledon in London.If all goes according to plan, the two say they’d like to play alongside one another again for Tokyo 2020 next summer.“(We’ve) had a lot of success in doubles.
That's been a real highlight in my career,”Venus saidduring the 2020 Australian Open.
In a perfect world, I would play (doubles) every time.
I love it.”Their most recent of major doubles titles came at Wimbledon 2016, when they captured No.14 in preparation for Rio (where they lost in the first round).The Williams Sisters at age 11 and 12Venus and Serena, Serena and VenusWhile plenty can be said about their rivalry, their respective greatness and their success on court, off the court they remain the very best of friends.“V was my guiding light,” Serenasaid in a Wimbledon videothis year about their childhood together, seen as prodigies from a young age.Serena said in 2018 she’s even cheering for Venus when they play one another, though she’s trying to focus on winning: “I never root against her, no matter what.
I think that's the toughest part (of playing her) for me.
When you always want someone to win, to have to beat them.
I know the same thing is for her.
When she beats me, she always roots for me as well.”After beating Serena to win Wimbledon in 2008, Venusput it simply:“My first job is big sister and I take that very seriously.”Add these to your favouritesVenus WILLIAMSSerena WILLIAMSTennisUSARelated contentThe Williams Sisters at age 11 and 12Venus Williams, Olympic dreams in mind, plays on at 40Serena Williams: Sports' return a ‘breath of fresh air’Serena Williams wins singles gold at London 2012How well do you know: Serena Williams?More fromTokyo 2020 | Olympic GamesVenus WILLIAMSSerena WILLIAMSTennisYou may like

1981Currently ranked the number one female tennis player in the
  world, Serena Williams has transcended sports to become a pop
  culture icon who devotes her considerable energy to improving
  children’s lives.Born in Michigan, Williams moved to California as a baby and,
  along with her older sister Venus, learned to play on the public
  tennis courts of Compton, a suburb of Los Angeles.
She was
  just five years old when she first picked up a racquet under the
  guidance of her father, a tennis coach.
She began playing
  professionally in 1995, and at seventeen she won her first major
  singles title when she defeated No.
1 Martina Hingis in the U.S.
  Open final.Since then, her many wins have placed her in the top spot in
  women’s tennis five times.
She currently holds thirteen grand
  slam singles titles (meaning a championship in one of the Majors
  – Wimbledon and the U.S., Australian, and French Opens) – the
  most of any player active today – along with eleven grand slam
  doubles titles and two in mixed doubles.
She has won more prize
  money than any other female athlete in history.
She also has two
  Olympic gold medals, won with Venus in doubles in 2000 and 2008.Noted for her unique style both on and off the court, Williams
  launched her own brand of designer apparel in 2004, and recently
  added a line of signature handbags and jewelry.She has thrown herself into philanthropy with a passion, using
  her wealth and celebrity to advance a variety of charitable
  causes, from funding breast cancer research to providing tennis
  clinics for at-risk youngsters.
Her foundation has two main
  goals: supporting youth who have been affected by violent crime
  and furthering education for underprivileged children around the
  world.
To that end, she has underwritten scholarships in the U.S.
  and has helped found two schools in Kenya.In recognition of her philanthropic work, business acumen, and
  outstanding tennis career, TIME magazine named her as one of the
  world’s top 100 most influential people for 2010.Share this pageShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on LinkedInThis item appears inBackThis item appears in:5th classFooter linkMay 27, 2021E-NewsRead moreFooter linkApril 10, 2012FacebookRead moreFooter linkJuly 18, 2014InstagramRead moreFooter linkApril 10, 2012TwitterRead moreFooter linkApril 10, 2012YoutubeRead moreFooter linkMarch 14, 2023LinkedInRead moreFooter linkFebruary 20, 2014PrivacyRead moreCopyright linkAugust 23, 2012ARCHIVES PLAZA • 1020 O ST, SACRAMENTO • (916) 653-7524 • © 2023 CALIFORNIA MUSEUM.

Words can't express my shock and horror," Williams said Friday.
He was just a complete icon.
Williams said she met Jackson a couple times and became as giddy as any other fan.
I was honored to meet him," she said.
I think any celebrity who met Michael Jackson was completely awed.
I know I was.
I kept thinking, 'Oh my God, oh my God.
It's him, it's him.'
So for me he was the celebrity of all celebrities.
Federer recalled going to a stadium in Basel, Switzerland, as a kid in the late 1980s with his sister and just standing outside to hear Jackson playing inside.
There was such excitement that he would come," Federer said.
Obviously I love his music.
... A very sad moment, I think, in the music world.
He touched many people.
Same for me.
But I'll obviously still listen to his music for many more years to come.
Williams wasn't able to name her favorite Jackson song but lauded his innovation, calling him "the greatest entertainer for me of all-time.
He did things that no one else did," she said.
Like 'Thriller' is the best video ever made still to this day.
The videos that he did for his songs, no one had ever even went that far.
And he started a whole new trend with that.
Dances, singing, beats, you know, everything.
Williams said she is "always online" and followed the news of Jackson's death on her computer.
I think Michael Jackson, everyone listens to his music," she said.
It's like you think of the Beatles, you think of Elvis Presley, you think of Michael Jackson.
Those are just lifetime icons that I've never forgotten.
The things that he did was beyond iconic.
Former world No.
1Andy Roddicksaid on his Twitter feed: "Oh my lord ... Michael Jackson died ... RIP sad and surreal.
Regardless of what you think of him he was completely revolutionary and will be missed.
Tracy Austin, once a teen tennis prodigy, said: "He was an incredible talent, an incredible singer and an incredible dancer.
It's along the lines of when Elvis passed away and everybody will remember where they were when they heard the news.

In a profile bySean GregoryofTime, she revealed she had learned that the man who fatally shot her sister, Yetunde Price, in 2003 had been released on parole.
I couldn't shake it out of my mind," Williams toldTime.Williams lost to Konta 6-1, 6-0 in a match that took just 53 minutes.Robert Edward Maxfield killed Price, the half-sister of Serena and Venus, on the night of Sept. 14, 2003, shooting her in the back of the head as she sat in a vehicle with her boyfriend in Compton, California.
Maxfield allegedly was seeking revenge on a gang when he shot at the vehicle.According to theDaily Mail'sRyan Parry, Maxfield was released three years early from his 15-year prison term in July due to good behavior.That's something that Williams takes issue with, as she explained to Gregory:"No matter what, my sister is not coming back for good behavior.
It’s unfair that she’ll never have an opportunity to hug me.
But also…the Bible talks about forgiveness.
I’m not there yet.
I would like to practice what I preach, and teach Olympia that as well.
I want to forgive.
I have to get there.
I’ll be there.

It was hard because all I think about is her kids,” Williams toldTime, “and what they meant to me.
And how much I love them.
While athletes, especially one as dominant as Williams,can be viewed as superhuman at times, they have to deal with off-the-court issues just like everyone else.
It's understandable for Williams to not be on top of her game after receiving tough news just minutes before a match.Williams touched on a number of other topics in the profile as well, such as her husband, her daughter and her return to tennis.Facebook LogoTwitter LogoCopy Link IconBleacher Report LogoFacebook LogoTwitter LogoInstagram LogoAboutAdvertiseContact UsGet HelpCareersCommunity GuidelinesPrivacyDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationTerms Of UseAdChoicesCopyright © 2023 Bleacher Report, Inc.

I was devastated,” she says.
I had planned the bachelorette party!”Six months later, Wozniacki and Williams are sitting, thigh to thigh, on a love seat in Williams’s Palm Beach Gardens house in Florida discussing the debacle.
My phone was going crazy,” Wozniacki remembers.
But I didn’t want to talk to anyone.” Most people got the message and stopped trying.
But Serena Williams isn’t most people.“I kept calling,” Williams says unapologetically.Wozniacki smiles at the memory.
First she texted, ‘If you don’t pick up, I am going to fly to Monaco.’ And then, ‘If you don’t answer the door, I am going to knock it down.’ So I thought, OK, I better answer the phone.
And I am so glad I did.
She wasn’t pitying me, like a lot of people were.
I mean, it’s not like anyone died.
I was in shock, but she was really helpful because she had been through it before.
She didn’t sugarcoat it, and she didn’t look down on me.
She was really there for me when I needed her the most, and that’s why I think our friendship is so strong now.”Serena Williams's version of "7/11" is a grand slam:“I was impressed with how strong she was,” Williams says.
And you know, there will be other engagement parties.” She pauses a beat.
Many.”And that’s when Wozniacki and Williams do the thing they do, oh, every three minutes when they are sitting together.
They burst into giggles.
Full on, eye-crinkling, doubled over, hiccuping guffaws, the kind you mostly see between teenage girls after the hot guy from homeroom walks by.
Could these be the same warriors who, only weeks earlier, had gone toe-to-toe in a bruising three-set match in Singapore, a pitched battle during which Serena destroyed a racket in a fit of rage?“I don’t ever want to stop,” says the number one–ranked female player in the world.
Donna Karan New York red silk-jersey dress.Photographed by Annie Leibovitz,Vogue,April 2015“Let’s just put an end to this myth that women players cannot be friends,” Williams says.
We can!” But traditionally, they haven’t been.
Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Maria Sharapova—champions all, but none noted for her cuddliness on, or off, the court.
Roger Federer might have dinner with Stan Wawrinka after a match, but among the women, it’s mostly cold shoulders.
It’s something players cultivate to keep their edge,” explains Mary Joe Fernandez, a former top-ten player who is now the captain of the American Fed Cup team.
Having her sister Venus with her on tour may have made Serena Williams even more insular.
When your best friend is with you day in and day out, why risk becoming vulnerable to another person?
Especially if that person might someday stand between you and a $3 million prize.Most PopularFashionThe Sheer Power of Transparent ClothingByHannah JacksonRoyalsThe Princess of Wales Breaks Royal Tradition With a Bold Easter ManicureBySilvia LópezCelebrity StyleKaia Gerber Steps Out In the Breakout Sneakers of SummerByChristian AllaireBut as Serena Williams has entered the golden age of her career, a moment when her fitness, court intelligence, and legendary focus have combined to make her practically unbeatable, she has done something that has surprised many in the tennis world.
She has mellowed.
You can see it in her friendship with Wozniacki.
You can see it in the confident way she cruised to victory against Sharapova last January in Australia.
I was really calm and positive,” she tells me later about her nineteenth Grand Slam title.
I knew I couldn’t get crazy on the court.
I have done everything I wanted to do in tennis.
There’s nothing missing, so all I have to do is go out there and do what I do best.” Finally, you can see it in her recently announced decision to go back to Indian Wells, a tournament she had vowed to boycott permanently after the largely white, largely senior audience booed the then–nineteen-year-old player throughout an entire match.
The crowd had believed that Venus had pulled out of a match at the last minute to make sure the two did not play each other in the semifinals.
It is a testament to her grit that Serena won on that difficult day, but she spent the next several hours weeping in the locker room.
Say whatever you want about me and Venus,” Williams would later write in her autobiography, “at the end of the day we were just a couple of kids, trying to do our best.”Injuries come and go, but that wound refused to heal.
Every year, officials at the tournament begged her to come back.
Every year, she said no.
Even a new owner, billionaire Larry Ellison, and his multimillion-dollar makeover of the tournament—there’s now a Nobu—did not sway her.
Then, about a year and a half ago, Williams spent Christmas vacation reading Nelson Mandela’s autobiography,Long Walk to Freedom.His account of his struggles caused her to reflect on how she was walking through her own life.
That’s when I realized I had to go back,” she says.
I always talk about forgiveness, but I needed to actually show it.
It was time to move on.” After she made the announcement in February, you could practically hear the tennis world sigh with relief.
As Mary Joe Fernandez says, “She’s changed, but so has tennis.
We’re never going to see anything like the Williams sisters again in American tennis, so having her back at such an important tournament is like seeing a circle close.
She’s one tough cookie, but she has the biggest heart.”It’s hard and lonely at the top,” Williams observes.
That’s why it’s so fun to have Caroline and my sister, tooThere are a few linespeople out there who might argue about the heart—more than once Williams has lost her temper with officials over a dubious call—but it is the complexity of her character that makes her such a compelling figure.
We love Serena Williams because, honestly, who among us hasn’t lost it at some point?
Anyone in the public eye for that long must get fed up with certain aspects of celebrity.
A few months after Palm Beach Gardens, I followed Serena down to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she was playing in a Fed Cup tournament, a modest event she would normally pass up were she not determined to play for the U.S. in the Olympics next year (if she qualifies, it will be her fourth time at the Games).
Seated at the press conference after trouncing her opponent, she seemed dismissive of the questions from the 25-year-old bloggers—“Have you had a chance to see our city?” “Why are you wearing long sleeves?” On the other hand, earlier in the day she hugged me hello.
Hugged!
In all my years of writing profiles, I can’t remember any subject ever hugging me.
Like I said, she’s complicated.Most PopularFashionThe Sheer Power of Transparent ClothingByHannah JacksonRoyalsThe Princess of Wales Breaks Royal Tradition With a Bold Easter ManicureBySilvia LópezCelebrity StyleKaia Gerber Steps Out In the Breakout Sneakers of SummerByChristian AllaireWilliams is the first to acknowledge that her heart doesn’t always come through.
As she tells me in Florida: “On the court, I am fierce!
I am mean and I am tough.
I am completely opposite off the court.
My confidence just isn’t the same.
I wish I was more like I am on the court.
Nobody would know that I am constantly crying or complaining.”“No,” Wozniacki objects, mock-horrified.
You do that?”She does.
Only minutes earlier, Williams had been complaining about the layer of winter weight that had settled around her body.
In a few weeks, she will begin the intense training that precedes her Grand Slam events, training that will clearly pay off at the Australian Open.
I should have gone on a diet weeks ago,” she moans.“We all get that off season,” Wozniacki reassures her.
I’m not sure what they were talking about.
Both look magnificently fit.
Earlier that month Wozniacki had even run the New York City Marathon, a project she undertook to help her forget that November was the month she was to have been married.
And Williams has long been among the most powerful players on the tour, thanks, initially, to Venus, who insisted they hire a physiotherapist when they were still teenagers.
Nowadays everybody goes to the gym,” Serena says.
But when I won my first Grand Slam, I had never been.” Even then, however, she was ambivalent about her naturally muscular physique, refusing to lift weights lest her arms get bigger.
I hated my arms,” she remembers.
I wanted them to look soft.” To this day, she uses TheraBands instead of weights to avoid overdeveloping her muscles.Once the sisters started training seriously, everything in women’s tennis changed, of course, something Mary Joe Fernandez remembers all too well.
When I started out, it was about being consistent and steady.
When they started hitting with so much power, everybody had to change their game too.” At 28, and recovering from wrist surgery, Fernandez didn’t think she could make that transition, so she retired.
Now, however, she appreciates having the Williamses around on the Fed Cup tour so the younger players can see up close just how hard they work.
Serena is in the gym every day and before every match, doing her stretches and warm-up.
She is so strong but so flexible.
She can do the splits.
Her core is like a rock.
That stuff doesn’t come naturally; that comes from work.”She won her first major at seventeen, and now she’s winning at 33?” says Brad Gilbert.
That kind of longevity is unheard-ofUnlike most elite athletes, Serena Williams has spent her entire life competing against the person to whom she is probably closest in the world.
As a child, she was so enthralled by sister Venus that their mother would force Serena to order first at restaurants; otherwise, she would just get whatever Venus was having.
Even now, well into their 30s and millionaires many times over, the two sisters continue to live together in a Florida mansion only fifteen minutes away from their father (their mother lives in L.A.).
When she is in town, Serena will have her father come over and coach her from the sidelines while she rallies with various hitting partners.
The most entertaining moment in Maiken Baird and Michelle Major’s documentary on the sisters from a few years ago is watching Serena berate Sascha Bajin, her long-suffering hitting partner, for returning the ball too softly to her.
You were just, like, hitting patty-cake!” she fumes.

The floors are shiny marble; the crystal chandeliers are as large as lawn mowers.
The upholstery on the ottoman is leopard-skin print.
When I visited, there was a large wooden crate in the foyer that had yet to be opened.
Inside lay Serena’s trophy for winning the U.S. Open a few months earlier (thanks to a lackluster Wozniacki in the final).
How long had the crate been there?
I asked an assistant.
She wasn’t sure.
When you’ve won that many Grand Slams, what’s another trophy?In order to beat her sister, Serena learned early on how to disconnect her emotions from the person on the other side of the net.
I don’t look at Venus on the court.
I can’t,” she said.
If I am winning, I might feel sorry for her.
If I’m losing, I will want to knock her out.” With the onset of her sister’s battle with Sjögren’s syndrome, the autoimmune disease that has drastically depleted Venus’s energy and caused a host of other health issues, Serena feels even more conflicted about beating her on the court.
She has gone through so much,” she says, suddenly serious.
Living with her, seeing her go through it, I don’t even know how she’s still playing.” (She is, though—and currently ranked seventeen.
Serena Williams hates losing so badly that she won’t play a game during practice, preferring instead to concentrate on the structure of a single point.
I am such a perfectionist, if I lose a game,” she says, “I go crazy.” As much as she wants to win, she can’t help feeling kind of bad when her good friend loses.
After that bruising showdown in Singapore, Williams slipped a note into Wozniacki’s bag, a drawing of an eye and a heart.
It was a gesture both tender and surprisingly girlish, but it worked.
I was upset I couldn’t close that match out,” Wozniacki says.
So when Serena came into the locker room and said, ‘I’m sorry,’ I was mad and said, ‘Will you retire?’ But then I got the note, and it was sweet, so I got over it.”View all images of Serena WilliamsArrowYounger than Serena by almost a decade, Wozniacki has a point.
At 33, most players really should retire.
But Williams isn’t most people.
It is unbelievable what Serena is doing right now,” says Brad Gilbert, a former professional player who is now a top coach.
She won her first major at seventeen, and now she’s winning at the age of 33?
That’s a range of sixteen years.
Whether for men or women, that kind of longevity in tennis is unheard-of.”Most PopularFashionThe Sheer Power of Transparent ClothingByHannah JacksonRoyalsThe Princess of Wales Breaks Royal Tradition With a Bold Easter ManicureBySilvia LópezCelebrity StyleKaia Gerber Steps Out In the Breakout Sneakers of SummerByChristian AllaireWilliams now belongs to an echelon of athletes—Tom Brady, Tim Duncan—who continue to perform at the highest level well past their expected prime.
Williams attributes her own staying power to the physical training she started so young—and a reduced schedule.
I don’t know how people play 32 tournaments a year.
The maximum I played was seventeen, and even then I didn’t feel like I had a life.” By playing less, she has avoided the physical and emotional burnout that leaves so many players embittered or ambivalent.
It was during the absences imposed by injuries, especially a blood clot in 2011, that she began wondering if she’d ever play again.
I really missed being out there,” she says.
Not the crowd or the atmosphere.
I just missed hitting the ball.
I realized then, Wow, when am I going to retire?
Because I don’t ever want to stop.”Five years ago, it was Wozniacki who was ranked number one, an astonishing feat for a player then only 20 years old, though some speculate she never would have made it that far had players like Justine Henin and Kim Clij­sters not been winding down their careers.
As injured players like Williams and Maria Sharapova returned, Wozniacki’s ranking bounced around, mostly staying in the top ten.
She’s now ranked at five.)
But for two years she was one of the very few people in the world, like Williams, to breathe the rarefied air of number one.Strangely enough, it’s not a position either of them particularly relishes.
It’s hard and lonely at the top,” Williams observes.
That’s why it’s so fun to have Caroline and my sister, too.
You’re a target when you’re number one.
Everyone wants to beat you.
Everyone talks behind your back, and you get a lot more criticism.
God forbid I lose.
It’s like ‘Why?’ Well, I am human.”“The worst was when they said, ‘Caroline was beaten by a player ranked below her,’ ” Wozniacki says.
Hello—when you’re number one,everyoneis ranked below you.“There are always people who aren’t going to like you,” Williams says.
Look at Jesus; there are people who didn’t like him.”“Wait, are you comparing yourself to Jesus?” Caroline asks.
It is, I’ve noticed, her role to elbow Serena in the ribs whenever she says anything too far out.Most PopularFashionThe Sheer Power of Transparent ClothingByHannah JacksonRoyalsThe Princess of Wales Breaks Royal Tradition With a Bold Easter ManicureBySilvia LópezCelebrity StyleKaia Gerber Steps Out In the Breakout Sneakers of SummerByChristian Allaire“Oh, God, no, I am far from it.
As everyone knows.
But as a Christian, I do try to be Christlike.”She got an opportunity to be supremely forgiving of Wozniacki in 2012 when Caroline blatantly stuffed her bra and skirt in an imitation of Serena’s physique during an exhibition match in Brazil.
It was meant as a joke.
I never would’ve done it if Serena and I weren’t friends,” Wozniacki says.
And hey, who wouldn’t want big boobs?”“Me,” Serena puts her hand up.
Hello?
Me!”Nevertheless, prominent African-American women like Whoopi Goldberg took umbrage at the caricature of the overripe Hottentot Venus, a visual meme that a young woman from Denmark, the daughter of a professional soccer player originally from Poland, might not fully grasp.
And so Williams, who had a very different coming-of-age in crime-ridden Compton, California, and even lost her sister Yetunde to a random act of gang violence, came to her friend’s defense.
I wasn’t offended,” Williams says.
And I felt bad for her because this girl does not have a mean bone in her body.”“She was really there for me when I needed her the most,” says Caroline Wozniacki of Williams.

In the past, the Williams sisters always stuck together, so it’s nice to see that friendship develop between the two of them.
On the court, they have such different styles—Caroline is very reserved, and Serena is more emotional.
She really wears her heart on her sleeve.
But when you talk to them you see they have a lot in common.
Caroline is always happy and doesn’t stop talking, and Serena is a real girl’s girl.” (That’s for sure.
Before our interview could start, the two spent a good five minutes gushing over pictures on an iPhone of clothes Caroline had recently bought.
Like Williams, Evert developed a close relationship with her rival, Martina Navratilova.
But unlike Williams, Evert eventually felt the need to create some distance.
Practicing with the competition turned out to be bad for winning.
She’d gotten to know my game so well,” says Evert, “she started beating me.” Williams says she has enjoyed sharing strategy with Caroline, but, tellingly, the two have never actually hit together just for fun.
When, last year, they shared a house in the Bahamas for a few days, Williams suggested they try it, but Wozniacki demurred.
I play tennis all year,” she says now.
On my vacation, I did not want to hit.”Instead, the two got up every morning, put on their bikinis, and hit the pool.
At night, they went out.
Williams claims the men swarmed all over Caroline, while ignoring her.
I am really shy.
I don’t talk to guys.”“You don’t talk to guys?” Caroline says in disbelief.
That is a lie.”“Friends?
Yes.
But a potential?
I get nervous that I will say the wrong thing, and then I just start laughing.”“Serena travels with a big entourage,” Caroline explains.
Some guys get intimidated by that.
Both of our dream guys are out there, just waiting.”Earlier, Williams had talked about her desire to start a family and have children, but now she shrugs.
I guess,” she says, sounding unconvinced.
I’m not even looking for it.” When the tennis does end, she has plans to expand her interest in fashion beyond her current clothing line on the Home Shopping Network into something more high-end.
She also hopes to increase her philanthropic activities—there’s a school in Kenya she has funded, along with a nursing scholarship named after her slain sister, and a partnership with the Equal Justice Initiative, an Alabama-based nonprofit that provides legal representation to indigent clients.
But for now, and the near future, Williams isn’t ready to take her foot off the pedal.
As she says, “I feel like I have a desire to be better than ever.
I am never, ever, satisfied.
I always want to do more, be more, reach a new level.
Not just in tennis but in everything I do.”Fashion Editor: Sara MoonvesIn this story: Hair: Holli Smith; Makeup: Francelle; Production Design: Mary Howard; Produced by Beth HenningTopicsSerena WilliamsTennisSportsVogue InstagramRead MoreSportsNaomi Osaka on the Mental Health Crisis Among Children—And a New Series of Meditations She’s Recorded to HelpByCorey SeymourWellnessTrain Like a Pro: How World Surf League Champion Stephanie Gilmore Stays Connected to Her BodyByCalin Van ParisWeddingsThe Cutest Celebrity Engagement Stories to Lift Your SpiritsByElise TaylorMagazineAn Ode to ArmsByAda CalhounArtsInJuggling Is Easy, Peggy Nolan Captures the Chaos of Growing UpByNadine ZylberbergShoppingNeed to Know Now: TheVogueJewelry Team’s Favorite Jewelry BrandsByCharlotte DiamondThe latest fashion news, beauty coverage, celebrity style, fashion week updates, culture reviews, and videos on Vogue.com.FacebookTwitterPinterestInstagramTiktokMore from VogueNewsletterCustomer CareVerify SubscriptionContact usAbout VogueCareersSee More StoriesFashionBeautyCultureLivingRunwayShoppingMagazineAccessibility HelpMastheadVisual StoriesCondé Nast SpotlightDo Not Sell My Personal Info©2023Condé Nast.

Richard was also, famously, their childhood tennis coach.
Smith portrays Richard while newcomers Demi Singleton and Saniyya Sidney play Serena and Venus, respectively.Recalling how their mother, Oracene Price, was the backbone of the family early on in the siblings' tennis careers, Serena tells Smith about the time their father quit his job to solely focus on being a coach.
My dad at one point was working and then, he stopped," she says.
He's like, 'This is what we're going to do.
I'm not going to have a job.
I'm gonna go with Venus and Serena, and train them every day.'
Now that would be impossible for me if my husband [Alexis Ohanian] were to tell me that.

But she had to support seven people, as a family of seven," Serena notes looking at her mom who was also seated around the red table with Smith and her daughters Isha and Lyndrea Price, who are Serena and Venus' half-sisters.
Eldest half-sister Yetunde Price was tragically killed in 2003.
Crediting the matriarch, Serena says neither she nor Venus would be the successful athletes they are today without their mom.

I remember that was always the main thing they’d talk about.
He is a selfish man, lives only for himself, he just uses his kids to get what he needs,” she added.
He’s not a dad, he was just a sperm donor.”The 55-year-old explained that Richard, 77, was first married to her mother, Betty Johnson, who had one daughter from a previous relationship, Katrina Jones, 61.
The couple then had five children together, including eldest Sabrina, Richard III, 53, Ronner, 52, Reluss, 51, and Reneeka, 49.When Sabrina was eight, she claims Richard abandoned the family after telling her he was going to the store to buy her a bicycle.Venus Williams (aged 11), father Richard, Serena (aged 9) and Brandy Williams.Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images“My mom told me later that he’s never coming back.
We went from having everything to nothing.
The best dresses, parties, we’d go places.
Now there was no new shoes or clothes.
I thought I was dad’s favorite and he loved me to death.”“But once he left, within a year, we became very poor, she continued.
There wasn’t always meals on the table.
We went downhill.
My mom became stressed out with six kids, trying to provide for us, she became aggressive.”As Sabrina’s mother turned abusive, she only recalls hearing from her father twice after he moved out, including once when she was 10 and a second time while she was in college.“In my teens, I was always thinking about suicide,” Sabrina admitted.
I tried it once, it was always with me, and it was about my dad, I had mental health issues.
Somehow, I got hold of my dad through a relative and asked for $1,000 to pay some of the college bill at Hope Christian University.
He said he’d only give me the money as a loan.

He gave me his number and told me to call him, then guess what?
The number he gave me was [out] of order.”Mother Betty was later diagnosed with cancer, passing away in December 1998.“She needed some medication for the cancer, and it was too expensive for her to pay for it.
I reached out to my dad, but I couldn’t get hold of him.
He had no interest whether she was dead or alive.
It was utterly mind-numbing that my dad couldn’t even come to my mom’s funeral.”Richard WilliamsWireImageAs for Venus and Serena, Sabrina says she’s proud of everything they’ve accomplished, but feels they should’ve attempted to reach out to their siblings on Richard’s side, just as they have with their half-siblings from their mother’s side of the family.“I love them as the blood in my family, but I don’t respect some of their decisions,” the mother of two shared.
If you were about the family, what about your other siblings?
If you cared about the world and everything you stand for, then why is your other half-siblings on the cover of Vogue with your baby — and the Williams side of the family aren’t?”Despite their tumultuous relationship, Sabrina hopes she and her father can someday bury the hatchet.“No matter what comes from speaking out, I’ll never stop loving my dad, I’d just like to have a cup of coffee with him, have closure and then he can walk away if he wants.
But I don’t think I’ll see him.
It’s heartbreaking, I want to show him that his eldest daughter has done amazing things, I want him to say well done, but I know he won’t.”She also believes she and her famous sisters will one day be able to reunite, adding, “I truly believe that because I’ve never been bitter, tried to go for the money, that we can meet somewhere.
I believe we have time to do that, I hold onto that hope.”Filed undercelebrity families,family feuds,serena williams,venus williams,1/10/20Share this article:Share this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)FlipboardWhatsAppClick to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to copy URLRead NextJulie Bowen says Wells Adams asked her permission to marry...Most Popular This Week1Madonna shows off ‘cute’ face after ‘swelling from surgery’ went down2Brooke Shields: Tom Cruise stopped sending me Christmas cake, cut Suri from card3Aubrey Plaza claims director made her masturbate on camera in resurfaced interview4Jennifer Lopez slammed for launching alcohol brand despite being sober: 'Such a money grab'5Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn break up after six years6Donald Trump makes post-arrest plea to Melania: 'I really need you'Popular ShoppingWalmart removes offensive shirt with hidden curse after complaintsWalmart removes offensive shirt with hidden curse after complaintsThe 9 best walking shoes for women in 2023, according to an expertThe 9 best walking shoes for women in 2023, according to an expertThe 30 best April new product launches, from Alpyn Beauty to BillieThe 30 best April new product launches, from Alpyn Beauty to BillieSave $100 on a Dyson Pure Cool Air Purifier Fan today on AmazonSave $100 on a Dyson Pure Cool Air Purifier Fan today on AmazonLive Apple-y ever after with this $219 refurbished iPad ProLive Apple-y ever after with this $219 refurbished iPad ProTrending NowThis story has been shared 12,673 times.12,673Bill and Hillary Clinton spend Easter 'in the buffet line'This story has been shared 11,111 times.11,111Kourtney Kardashian trolled for giving 'grandma vibes' with Easter outfitThis story has been shared 9,244 times.9,244Donald Trump makes post-arrest plea to Melania: 'I really need you'This story has been shared 5,551 times.5,551Kathy Griffin spends Easter getting MRI after lung cancer battleNowOnNow on Page Six StylePaulina Porizkova poses naked with stuffed animal for 58th birthdayPaulina Porizkova poses naked with stuffed animal for 58th birthdayKourtney Kardashian trolled for giving ‘grandma vibes’ with Easter outfitKourtney Kardashian trolled for giving ‘grandma vibes’ with Easter outfitKendall Jenner gets cheeky in butt-baring thong bikiniKendall Jenner gets cheeky in butt-baring thong bikiniSEE ALLNow OnNow on DeciderKim Kardashian Teases ‘American Horror Story’ Role as Ryan Murphy Calls Her “True Force in the Culture”Kim Kardashian Teases ‘American Horror Story’ Role as Ryan Murphy Calls Her “True Force in the Culture”SEE ALLMore StoriesnypostLouisville shooter Connor Sturgeon was star athlete but suffered 'multiple concussions'page sixBill and Hillary Clinton spend Easter 'in the buffet line'New York PostEmail NewslettersMobile AppsContact UsTipsFacebookTwitterInstagramEmailYouTubeSections & FeaturesVideoPhotosNewsletters & FeedsEmail NewslettersPodcastsRSS FeedsContact UsTipsAdvertise/Media KitContactVulnerability Disclosure ProgramAppsiPhone AppAndroid PhoneFollow usFacebookTwitterInstagramEmailYouTube© 2023 NYP Holdings, Inc.
