193 On April 4 Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter s board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9 of the company.
194 195 However on April 13 Musk made a 43 billion offer to buy Twitter launching a takeover bid to buy 100 of Twitter s stock at 54.20 per share.
191 196 In response Twitter s board adopted a poison pill shareholder rights planto make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15 of the company without board approval.
197 Nevertheless by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately 44 billion.
198 This included about 12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and 21 billion in equity financing.
199 200 Tesla s stock market value sank by over 100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal causing Musk to lose around 30 billion of his net worth.

231 Musk s handling of employees whom he communicates with directly through mass emails has been characterized as carrot and stick rewarding those who offer constructive criticism while also being known to impulsively threaten swear at and fire his employees.
235 236 237 Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours sometimes for 80 hours per week.

Is Elon Musk living at a lakefront mansion in Austin NewsSportsHookem.comAustin360OpinionAdvertiseObituarieseNewspaperLegalsSubscribeBUSINESSElon Musk says he lives in a 50 000 tiny home.
Is he actually living at a friend s Austin mansion Kara CarlsonAustin American StatesmanThe possibility of eccentric billionaire Elon Musk living or owning property in Austin has been a topic of debate and rumors since the head of Tesla and SpaceX first said he moved to Texas in 2020.But while Musk has proudly declared himself a resident of the Lone Star State it s been much less clear if he might also be a resident of Central Texas.According to areport by the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday the billionaire has been living for much of the past year in a mansion on Lake Austin owned by a longtime friend and also has been shopping for one of his own in the Austin area.Welcome to Musklandia Austin adjusts to life with Tesla and its eccentric billionaire boss Elon MuskCiting unnamed sources the newspaper reported that Musk has been staying in the waterfront estate of fellow billionaire Ken Howery.But both Musk and Howery called the Wall Street Journal report inaccurate.
The WSJ article is false.
I don t live there and am not looking to buy a house anywhere Musk said ina statement to Insider.Related Tesla officially moves headquarters to site of new Austin factoryHowery said in a text message to the Wall Street Journal after publication of its story that Musk does not live at my house he lives in South Texas.
He stayed at the house as my guest occasionally when traveling to Austin Howery said.The mansion cited by the Journal is located near Mount Bonnell and is part of an exclusive development called Watersedge.
The expansive digs include almost 8 000 feet of interior space a waterfront pool a jacuzzi and a private boat slip in a neighborhood guarded by several sets of gates and a guardhouse.Tesla Seemingly an odd couple Tesla and Texas becoming tightly entwinedMusk has said that his primary residence is in a 50 000 modular mini house in Boca Chica near SpaceX s launch facility in South Texas.Still he clearly spends significant time in Austin where Tesla is building a 1.1 billion factory and where the company s official headquarters is now located.In addition he has said previously that he was staying at a friend s house in Austin while in the area for a shareholder s meeting although it was uncertain at the time to whom he was referring.During Tesla s October shareholders meeting held virtually from the Austin factory the same event in which he announced the decision to move the company s headquarters to Austin from California Musk referenced staying at a friend s house in the region.
He said he used the self driving feature of his Tesla car to get from his friend s residence to the event.More Texas 130 sign directs Austin drivers to Tesla Road but there is no Tesla Road yet I actually drove here from a friend s house I am staying out in Austin which is quite far away and has quite a complicated drive and the car took me all the way from my friend s house to the Gigafactory with no intervention.
So perfect drive Musk said.Musk also mentioned he was at a friend s house in Austin during the severe freeze in February saying it lost power heat and internet access.
Grimes Musk s now ex girlfriend also said that she lived in Austin.Musk has long known Howery who co founded PayPal Holdings where Musk was once an executive.
Howery also later co founded a venture capital firm with Peter Thiel called Founders Fund which has backed some of Musk s companies.Recently Howery has been traveling the world leaving his house empty for Musk s use the Wall Street Journal reported.Previously Tesla CEO Elon Musk sells 1.1 billion in Tesla shares to pay taxesAccording to Travis Central Appraisal District property records the owner of the mansion is Edge Trust U A D and it was valued at 12.6 million last year.
It s unclear if Musk is paying rent to Howery the Wall Street Journal reported.The newspaper also reported that Musk may be looking for his own property in the region and has had several real estate agents show him Austin area houses for sale.
The report said he has shown interest in several houses including a custom mansion owned by Austin based jewelry designer Kendra Scott although Scott declined to comment to the Journal.Musk announced publicly last year that he was selling almost all of his physical possessions to simplify his life and would own no property or houses and he s been selling properties since.He is registered to vote in Cameron County near Boca Chica beach at a home built in 1971 that occupies one fifth of an acre the Journal reported.
The house is owned by SpaceX according to the newspaper.Last December Musk confirmed he had moved to Texas from California without disclosing where saying he wanted to be closer to the new Tesla factory on the outskirts of Austin and to SpaceX s South Texas facilities.Amid the pandemic Central Texas has increasingly become a center of activity for Musk and his various companies.His tunneling and infrastructure company The Boring Co. has had a presence in the area since last year and purchased land in Bastrop County.
His neurotechnology company Neuralink has had job postings in Austin in recent months.
His private foundation the Musk Foundation moved to Austin in the summer of 2020 and SpaceX may also be expanding into Austin.American Statesman staff writer Shonda Novak contributed to this report.CareersStaff DirectoryAccessibilitySite MapLegalsOur Ethical PrinciplesSubscription Terms ConditionsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy Rights Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info Cookie PolicyContact UsSupport Local BusinessAdvertise Your BusinessAdvertising Terms and ConditionsPromote your EventLicensing ReprintsAustin American Statesman StoreHelp CenterSubscriber GuideMy AccountGive FeedbackPromote Your EventSubscribe TodayNewslettersFacebookTwitterInstagrameNewspaperArchivesJobsCarsHomesClassifiedsReviewed.com10BestLocaliQ Digital Marketing SolutionsEventsUSA TODAY Sports 2023 www.statesman.com.

The writer cited it as Musk s favorite Mexican restaurant so I decided to give it a try.I dined at Elon Musk s favorite Mexican restaurant in Austin.Katherine Stinson Business InsiderSource FTFonda San Miguel was started in 1975 by business partners Tom Gilliland and Miguel Ravago.Fonda San Miguel is still housed in the same building Gilliland and Ravago found in 1975.Katherine Stinson Business InsiderGilliland told Insider the pair moved Fonda San Miguel from its original location in Houston to Austin after stumbling upon the abandoned building that once housed another restaurant.The entrance to Fonda San Miguel is tucked away in North Central Austin.Katherine Stinson Business InsiderGilliland said he and Ravago met while attending a foreign trade school in Phoenix Arizona and Ravago s family essentially adopted him.The atrium is the first thing you see entering the restaurant.Katherine Stinson Business InsiderThe authentic Mexican cuisine that Ravago s grandmother cooked is what inspired Gilliland.
Ravago the restaurant s namesake has since died.Fonda San Miguel is definitely worth a visit.Katherine Stinson InsiderI arrived about 20 minutes before the restaurant opened at 5 p.m. on a Wednesday.
I was surprised guests were allowed inside before opening but it added to the restaurant s cozy atmosphere.You can sit in the central atrium or one of the side tables in the back for more privacy.Katherine Stinson InsiderThe two front of house hostesses told me I was welcome to sit anywhere in the atrium.
The atrium had bar seating for walk ins who still wanted to enjoy the full menu.A four seater in the atrium area.Katherine Stinson InsiderThe two hostesses warned me to grab a spot quickly before the restaurant opened.
The moment 5 p.m. hit guests started to flood in.An entryway to one of Fonda San Miguel s main dining areas.Katherine Stinson Business InsiderDon t be fooled by how small Fonda San Miguel appears on the outside The restaurant interior is spacious and filled with multiple dining rooms for guests.There really isn t a bad seat in the house at Fonda San Miguel.Katherine Stinson InsiderThe restaurant was packed within 10 minutes.
If you can t arrive right when it opens you can make a reservation.The greenery in Fonda San Miguel s dining rooms was a nice touch.Katherine Stinson Business insiderService was incredibly fast.
Soon after I sat down I was provided free chips and salsa as a starter.Katherine Stinson InsiderGilliland said this is an Americanized tradition and not standard in Mexican restaurants it was the only compromise he made when attempting to keep Fonda San Miguel as authentic as possible based on customer feedback.There s something so comforting about free chips and salsa.Katherine Stinson InsiderMusk ordered the house frozen margarita in the Financial Times article he called it a slushy with alcohol .
Since it was happy hour when I arrived every tequila based drink was 1 off.The Silver Coin tasted like tart alcoholic watermelon juice.
I preferred the traditional house margarita which was a bit sweeter.Katherine Stinson InsiderI was intrigued by the Silver Coin a watermelon based tequila margarita served straight up so I ordered one for comparison.
I preferred Musk s drink of choice.Katherine Stinson InsiderFor an appetizer I tried one of the dishes Musk ordered the Cordero the Spanish word for lamb lamb chops which cost 24.95.The Cordero lamb chops if you can t handle spice the salsa is not for you .Katherine Stinson InsiderTraditionally a Cordero dish is prepared during festivals and celebrations where a whole lamb is slowly roasted over an open flame.Katherine Stinson InsiderThe side of salsa de morita a red salsa based around the flavor profile of a morita chile pepper wasn t even necessary.
Each bite of the Cordero chops was bursting with a rich and buttery flavor profile that felt like a perfect marriage of the garlic herbs and lemon that are used in the dish.The flavors added to the Cordero enhanced the meat s natural flavor.Katherine Stinson InsiderOne of the other options Musk ordered was the Angels on Horseback three bacon wrapped shrimp with white cheese and jalapeno served with a housemade escabeche sauce a citrusy marinade seasoned with spices like paprika .
I couldn t eat this dish due to allergies but other diners told me the sauce reminded them of the escabeche their abuelas used to make.A post shared by Fonda San Miguel fondasanmiguel Another dish Musk tried was the mixiote slow cooked seasoned lamb served in a papillote that costs 38.95.
I was told by other patrons that the dish had the same savory melt in your mouth sensation I had with the Cordero.A post shared by fondasanmigueltxI was impressed there was also a plant based section of the menu.
Gilliland hired a sous chef from the holistic spa hotel Miraval Austin to carefully curate this section.
I ordered the 18 vegan enchiladas de hongos y coliflor plate to compare to the meat dishes.The vegan enchiladas de hongos y coliflor.Katherine Stinson InsiderThe meatless mixture in the enchiladas de hongos y coliflor was a satisfying blend of mushrooms walnuts garlic and onions.
The creamy salsa verde on top really wrapped the flavors together with a spicy kick that wasn t overwhelming.The vegan creamy salsa verde was the perfect plate dressing.Katherine Stinson InsiderWhile I enjoyed the vegan enchiladas the main meat dishes I tried were the real stars of the show particularly the 29.95 tacos al carbon wagyu steak served with tortillas a nopal paddle grilled onions and salsa albanil.Katherine Stinson InsiderThis was my favorite meat based dish.
However both this and Musk s favorite had incredibly tender bites of meat that were cooked to perfection.Tacos al carbon Tortillas not pictured .Katherine Stinson InsiderAnother dish Musk ordered was the chile en nogada which currently isn t available on the menu.
According to the restaurant s Instagram page the dish is one of the most important meals in Mexico as it contains the colors of the Mexican flag and is traditionally eaten on September 16 Mexican Independence Day.A post shared by fondasanmigueltxAs I waited for my dessert I checked out the bathroom which was super clean and vibrant.The ladies restroom.Katherine Stinson InsiderFor dessert I ordered the postres de la tierra a vegan bread pudding that costs 14.
There s also an assortment of nonvegan desserts.
My server noticed it took half an hour for my dessert to come out so she brought me a second plate free of charge.Katherine Stinson InsiderThe salty popcorn balanced out the sweetness of the vegan caramel and chocolate glaze drizzled over the soft piece of bread in the plate s center.
The menu said it had banana as well but I never tasted that flavor in the dish.
The postres de la tierra is dairy and egg free.Katherine Stinson InsiderGilliland said he and Ravago decided they would leave their celebrity guests alone when they chose to dine at Fonda San Miguel and the servers are trained never to ask for autographs.The bar at Fonda San Miguel.Katherine Stinson InsiderGilliland wants every single customer to feel like a celebrity.
If great customer service and stellar food from start to finish equaled a celebrity experience then call me an A lister.You can be your own paparazzi in the ladies restroom.Katherine Stinson InsiderWhile there s nothing wrong with cheaper Tex Mex spots Fonda San Miguel truly delivered on an elevated dining experience dedicated to details from the beautiful interior design to the flavorful authentic Mexican menu.The restaurant was still packed hours after I first arrived.Katherine Stinson InsiderRead nextFeaturesauthentic mexicanMexican FoodMore...Close iconTwo crossed lines that form an X .

All Rights ReservedThe Truth About The First Car Elon Musk Ever OwnedNEWSTECHCARSGAMINGENTERTAINMENTSCIENCEHEALTHREVIEWSFEATURESThe Truth About The First Car Elon Musk Ever OwnedTheo Wargo Getty ImagesByKyle Encina Oct. 4 2022 10 06 am ESTBefore Elon Musk was driving Teslas he was first in an iconic yet archaic car that became quite problematic.
The Tesla CEO is known for having an eclectic taste in cars from vintage classics to modern supercars.
His passion for owning exotic sports cars only grew over the years and now he doesn t just opt for anything that s simply fast.
Rather Musk often has an eye for certain car models that stand out in a big way.
This includes celebrated beauties like the Jaguar E Type and the multimillion dollar McLaren F1.
In fact Musk even used an old automobile icon as inspirationfor his most polarizing Tesla model.
So does that mean every car he s owned was a road spectacle as well Sure if a car is significant enough Musk is willing to pay top dollar for it even if it s just a movie prop but he didn t always splurge on cars early in his career.
In fact Musk bought his first car in 1994 for a mere 1 400 viaCNBC .
The tech mogul bought an old BMW that he had to fix up himself.
Of course this wasn t just any ole Bimmer it was a 1978 BMW 320i.
Known internally as the E21 it marked the debut of the iconic 3 series.
While these cars were certainly lookers not all of them were made equal.What was Elon Musk s first car like Oskars Kupics ShutterstockThe first BMW 3 series wasn t just historical it also set standards with its driver focused angled dashboard that later became the norm in succeeding models viaBMW .
However there were numerous types of E21s produced between 1975 and 1983 base models ranged from the 316 and 318 to the more powerful 320.
The entry level BMW E21 316 featured a four cylinder engine generating 98 bhp which was more than enough at the time considering it only weighed a little over 1 000 kg viaAutoweek .
On the other hand Musk s 1978 E21 was a higher end 320i variant which was deemed a halo model given its array of upgrades.Among its various notable improvements included an independent suspension setup an improved 125 bhp and a top speed of 112 mph.
Its blend of sporty and luxury not to mention its historical significance makes the E21 quite desirable even in the modern era.
For instance an older 1977 BMW 320i was sold viaSotheby sfor almost 30 000 in 2020.
If that s the case then it certainly sounds like a car that Musk would want to be holding onto for a long time.
But did Musk even keep his first car What happened to Elon Musk s first car fireflite59 ShutterstockReliability becomes a major concern for a car that s bought over a decade after its production.
The same can be said with Musk s old BMW as it eventually showed its age within just two years of ownership.
In aYouTube video interview Musk told Forbes his 78 320i had one of its wheels literally fall off while being driven by an intern on an errand run.
Although Musk himself wasn t physically involved in the incident his first car still ended up getting scrapped afterward.
For a car that already needed repairs the moment it was bought that was bound to happen sooner or later.
It doesn t help that old BMWs like the E21 are known for showing signs of mechanical failures over time either.According toGrassroots Motorsports the 320i came with a Bosch K Jetronic Constant Injection System that is not cheap to repair and tends to cause issues over time.
Its suspension also has a tendency of being a bit unstable upon reaching speeds of 45 mph.
In addition its engine s head gaskets are prone to warping while its handbrake is notorious for becoming unresponsive after prolonged usage viaHemmings .
The E21 was a fairly reliable vehicle in its prime but there s a fine line between owning a dependable classic and a metallic death trap.
Unfortunately Musk s first BMW experience was leaning more toward the latter.
One thing is for sure the E21 definitely won t be showing up in theTesla head s opulent car collectionany time soon.Recommended

He had it for two years when one of the wheels fell off an unfortunate incident that happened when one of his interns from his first company Zip2 was driving it.When Musk got an initial bonus for Zip2 the web software company he and his brother cofounded Musk used the money to buy a 1967 E Type Jaguar.Jaguar E Type.Jeff Christensen ReutersMusk explained in theForbes videothat when he was 17 he was given a book of classic convertibles.

And to date the EV maker isvalued at around 800 billionand is still growing.
It s pretty obvious the CEO Elon Musk knows his vehicles.
But you can t help but wonder which cars he s owned over the years.In an interview withForbes Musk revealed his first vehicle and a few others he purchased on the way.Elon Musk s claim to fameRoad trip ElonMusk s Tesla Roadster won t strike Earth anytime soon.
New research suggests the vehicle will cruise through space for tens of millions of yearshttps t.co ysQbHsYJw0 SpaceXpic.twitter.com wALPDVwzZs Scientific American sciam February 20 2018Elon Musk has made a name for himself by carving a spot in the automotive world for all electric vehicles.
Though he didn t found Tesla he put forth alarge sum of the moneyto establish the brand and get its name on the map.
He would go on to create some of the most innovative EVs.Musk started with his own company Zip2 after trying to get a job at Netscape Tech Timesreported.
He realized he was too shy to talk to other people to clinch the deal in interviews.
With no job prospects he entered the internet world with a website software company he co owned with his brother.
Later it would become known as PayPal.Eventually he found his way to designing Tesla s first vehicle the Roadster in 2008.
A decade later he sent one of these cars into space by strapping it to theSpaceX Falcon Heavy.
It s still orbiting the sun which experts say it will probably continue doing for the next few million years with a dummy nicknamed Starman at the wheel.Elon Musk s first 2 car purchasesThe first car Musk owned and liked was a 1978 BMW 320i he paid 1 400 in 1994 and fixed up himself EdwinMillerHCIThttps t.co 8SIGGP9Dnd Farzad Mostashari Farzad MD October 13 2017In 1994 Musk purchased his first car a 1978 BMW 320i that cost him 1 400.
He fixed it up to be a pretty nice looking vehicle which he drove for two years.
One day a Zip2 intern was driving it when a wheel fell off the car.
At that point Musk junked it.When he got his initial Zip2 bonus of 40 000 he went car shopping.
This time he set his sights on the one car he always wanted a Jaguar E Type.
He bought a 1967 model for 35 000.
The car was a dream come true but not for long.Musk called it a bad girlfriend because it gave him lots of trouble.
He said it kept breaking down and always needed repairs.
The first time it gave him grief was when he drove it home from the dealer he told Forbes.What other vehicles has he owned RelatedElon Musk Was Near Death After Doctors Made the Wrong DiagnosisMusk made his next car purchase after he sold Zip2.
He bought a McLaren F1 which looked like somethingout of a sci fi movie.
Musk kept the vehicle for several years and put 11 000 miles on it.
He used it as his daily driver until he gave his buddy Peter Thiel a ride in it and tried to show off.
The car hit an embankment and rolled over totaling it.
He didn t have it insured.The most interesting car Musk owned was the Lotus Esprit Submarine used in the James Bond movieThe Spy Who Loved Me.
He spent 920 000 on it at an auction but was disappointed to see it didn t transform into a submarine as it had in the movie.
So he decided that someday he would use the Tesla electric powertrain and get the Esprit to work as a submarine in the water.Elon Musk has owned a few other vehicles over the years.
He has also driven Model S and Model 3 Performance cars a Model X and the new Cybertruck which isn t slated tocome out until 2022.Tags BMWCelebritieselon muskInstagramYoutubeFacebookTwitterAbout UsContact UsCareersOwnership funding advertising infoCorrections CommitmentFact checking commitmentEthicsShowbiz Cheat SheetEndgame360Sportscasting Copyright 2023 Endgame360 Inc.

Apart from making the world a better place working to privatize and publicize space travel and aiming to colonize Mars the man also has a passion for producing electric cars.Updated March 2023 Elon Musk needs no introduction but some of the cars in his fleet aren t close to what people might have expected.
To keep the intrigue on we ve updated this list with more cars found in Elon Musk s personal collection.What might come as a surprise however is that Musk doesn t own justelectric carsinhis garage.
In fact he s quite the gearhead with some truly unique and remarkable cars he calls his own.
Here are the cars that this billionaire genius space boy and philanthropist has in his garage.121978 BMW 320i Musk s First CarBritish GQMusk s first car a 1978 BMW 320i clearly shows off his humble beginnings.
In fact back in those days a BMW wasn t quite the status symbol it is today.
Of course this car is part of history itself as it was the very first iteration of the legendary 3 Series we know and love today.He bought this car for 1 400 and fixed it up himself.
Sadly one of its wheels fell off when an intern Elon had lent it to during his time at the first company Zip2 tried turning the Bimmer.
A few minutes later the intern called up Musk to inform him of the news after which Elon decided to do away with it.111997 McLaren F1 His Celebratory Purchase And Musk s First SupercarThe iconicMcLaren F1 was Elon Musk s gift to himself.
In his own words when he sold Zip2 his first company he decided to buy an F1 which is the best car ever in the man s opinion.
Sadly Musk ended upcrashing the F1after putting over 11k miles on it as he used it quite frequently to commute from LA to San Francisco.Eventually he sold thesupercarin 2007 and that too for a profit Musk shared that the reason for selling the iconic car was that he didn t want people to always be writing about how he owns a gas guzzling high performance sports car.RELATED How Mr. Bean Crashed His McLaren F1 Twice And Still Sold It For Profit101976 Lotus Esprit Wet NellieLotus Esprit TurboTheiconic car cum submarine fromThe Spy Who Loved Me this beauty in Musk s garage had been the only functioning barely prop from the James Bond flick.
When it eventuallyheaded to auction Musktook it off the handsof the auctioneers in 2013 for nearly a million dollars.Musk got enamored with the car ever since he saw Bond press a button and turn the Esprit into anamphibious vehicle.
Of course like the rest of us Musk too got disappointed to find that Wet Nellie couldn t actually transform into a submarine.RELATED This Is Why Every Self Respecting Collector Should Buy A Lotus Esprit Turbo S392012 Porsche 911 Turboelferspot.comWho can blame Elon Musk for getting enamored with one of the most iconic and legendary sports cars of all time However he wasn t quite on board with the humongous gas guzzling engine owing to which he became obsessed with the idea of turning hisPorsche 911 electric.Of course the rest is history as he contacted a couple of entrepreneurs who had founded Tesla in 2003 an e car startup.
So in some ways the 911 Turboshould take the credit for leading Musk to the path that he paves today with Tesla.82010 Audi Q7 The Inspiration For The Falcon DoorsAudiThe Audi Q7 was one of the world s most luxurious SUVs in 2010 back when Musk needed a big car for his large family.
However Musk was quite vocal about his gripe with the Q7 calling it particularly horrendous.
Thus when developing his own electric SUV the Model X Musk kept in mind his problems with the Q7.
Thefalcon doors on the Model Xwere born ensuring entry into the back row of the car without having to break a sweat.RELATED Here s What Makes The 2010 Q7 The Best Audi SUV Of The Century72006 BMW M5 Tuned by HamannBring a TrailerYet again a car Musk owned in the past inspired him on one of the innovations in one of his own Tesla cars.The BMW M5 was a powerful carin itself.
However Musk went the extra step and got BMW tuning specialist Hamann to delimit the V10 upping the power to a monstrous 600 hp.In fact the beastly power that Musk obtained on his M5 alongside making it slightly wider and more aggressive is what inspired him to install the Ludicrous mode in the Tesla Model S. No wonder Musk is always obsessed with pushing his cars in terms of flat out acceleration he certainly loves pure speed.61920 Ford Model TBritish GQTheFordModel T is truly history on wheels.
Henry Ford made themost influential car of the 20th centurywhen he decided to come out with the Model T the first mass produced vehicle for the public.In fact the Model Twas a gift to Musk from a friend.
Thus it just somehow makes perfect sense that the most influential car of the 20th century gets housed in the garage of arguably the most influential carmaker of the 21st century.RELATED The Ford Model T Top Speed Vs Its Rivals5Model XTeslaApparently Musk isn t only in the business of building cars just for the world to solely enjoy.
He actively enjoys his innovations as well as his fleet of cars also includes Tesla models such as the Model X.
Notably Musk revealed this information to the world a few years back through his Twitter account.
A mid size luxury crossover EV that has been in production since 2015 Musk loves the Model X for its practicality as he uses it mainly when driving his kids.41967 E Type Jaguar RoadsterMecum AuctionsMusk revealed how he saw the Jaguar E typein a classic convertible catalog at the age of 17.
That s when he decided it would be the car he brings home if ever he could afford it.
However he also recalls how the E Type was like a bad girlfriend for him.
It kept breaking down on me Musk remembers.In fact the car even broke down on the way back home from the dealer When they bought out Zip2 the E Type Jag was what Musk bought with his 40 000 bonus from the deal.
Of course the extravagant man that he is he spent all but 5 000 from the bonus on the car itself.
Nevertheless the Roadster still calls Musk s garage its home.3Tesla Roadster The One That s Up ThereSpaceX Via Wikimedia CommonsObviously Musk owns a Tesla Roadster.
However this one is no longer in his garage it s among the stars high up in space.
In 2018 with the launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket by SpaceX Musk packed his Roadster to go up into the dark skies with a dummy astronaut sitting at the wheel.Moreover anyone cantrack where exactlyin the orbit the Roadster is floating around.
Of course it s quite historic without the added bragging rights of floating in space this was Tesla s first electric car.
Based on a Lotus Elise chassis and outfitted with lithium ion batteries the Roadster was capable of reaching the 60 mph mark in a mere 3.7 seconds.RELATED This Is What Made The Original Tesla Roadster So Special22019 Tesla Model S PerformanceTeslaIt is the Tesla Model S that Elon Musk prefers to drive the most.
After all many consider the Model S to be the most comfortable and accommodating of the entire Tesla lineup.
It is also the car in which Musk introduced the Ludicrous mode inspired by his Hamann tuned BMW M5.However that was not enough speed for the billionaire as heintroduced a Plaid variantfor the Model S as well which was capable of going even faster than a ludicrously quicker regular Model S.12020 Tesla Cybertruck Are We Even Surprised Fox NewsDoes it come as any surprise at all that one of the most polarizing individuals on the planet drives around in the most polarizing vehicle this side of the century Controversially designed withbulletproof windows advertised the Cybertruck isn t out to the public owing to pandemic shutdowns.The Cybertruck by way of hype alone raised 20 million for Tesla with an astonishing 100 deposits.
However everyone waiting for their Cybertrucksnow has to wait until later in 2023for the Cybertruck to be available as revealed by Musk.Undoubtedly Elon Musk s vehicle garage is one of the most varied and interesting out there.

The car is a gift from her sonElon Musk the Tesla C.E.O.
and arguably the most famous inventor entrepreneur of his generation.
But my friends tell me I was famous before Elon was famous she says flashing a smile that suddenly looks familiar from a Target billboard in Times Square a campaign for Virgin America and Beyonc s video for her song Haunted.
Musk s life storyreads like a stylish adventure book.
She was born Maye Haldeman in Regina Saskatchewan in 1948 to explorer parents who had met when her father a caretaker came to take lessons with her mother a ballroom dancing instructor.
When Musk was nearly three the family including her three siblings moved to Pretoria South Africa.
She started modeling at 15 when models had to have their own shoes and jewelry and was a finalist in the 1969 Miss South Africa contest.
By 21 she had earned a bachelor s in dietetics and she would go on to juggle nutritional clients with fashion shoots.
She married Errol Musk an engineer in 1970 had three kids Elon has a younger brother Kimbal and a sister Tosca but divorced him nine years later and followed her children as they left apartheid South Africa for careers in North America.
Elon s nickname was genius boy though she s quick to add All my kids are brilliant.
Kimbal created the Kitchen a family of farm to table restaurants and Tosca is a filmmaker.
Maye moved to Toronto then New York and in 2013 settled in Marina del Rey California to be near the grandkids.Lately the fashion world has been paying more attention to the five decade model.
I m living proof that you can find work for an older woman .
. .
I ve never worked so much as I do now Musk says proudly.
The jobs have evolved from mother of the bride commercials to mother of Elon editorials which doesn t bother her one bit I don t care why a client books me as long as they book me.

She showed up in a bubblegum pink sheath dress her short silver hair combed into a sleek pompadour and makeup meticulously done and greeted me with a magazine perfect smile.
She ordered an avocado toast with coffee.
I love bread she said.The 71 year old fashion model and dietician holds numerous records throughout her 50 year career she was the only plus size model in South Africa in the 1970s as well as one of the oldest models in the country during a time when the industry was dominated by teens and early twenty somethings.
In 2015 Maye was signed by American modeling giant IMG at age 67 and became the oldest spokesperson for CoverGirl two years later at 69.
Outside the fashion world she s also known as themother of Elon Musk the founder ofTeslaandSpaceX.SEE ALSO Rebecca Minkoff Reveals Her Ideal Look for Millennial WomenMaye is proud when people take notice of her last name and often takes the opportunity to spread good words about her two other children Kimbal Musk a chain restaurateur and Tosca Musk a filmmaker and media entrepreneur.
But she makes an intentional effortnotto reinforce the impression of herself as merely a celebrity mom who feeds on her famous son.
When we go to work events people are more amazed byher said Maye s manager.
Her energy her positivity her beauty and her fashion which is always a stopper.
For the past few weeks Maye and her team have been flying to major cities all over the world to promote her new book A Woman Makes a Plan an autobiographical self help guide backed by personal stories and lessons learned from a turbulent life spanning seven decades.Last month she was in Shanghai China whereTeslarecently opened itsfirst overseas Gigafactoryand Elon is a household name.
You d think people would be all over Tesla and Elon with the big factory opening.
But no they didn t ask about him much Maye said.Not that people in her professional circle follow electric vehicle developments and rocket science closely anyway.
People in fashion just couldn t care less her manager joked.Maye Musk became the oldest spokesperson for CoverGirl in 2017 at age 69.Mike Coppola Getty Images for COVERGIRLWith her enviable upright posture and not a shred of sagging muscle on her face Maye oozes all the glamour and glitz one would imagine from a supermodel and wellness guru.
Her book however is filled with unglamorous stories about fighting adversaries and starting over from rock bottom.
When I told Elon Kimbal and Tosca that I was going to write a book they all said If you are writing a book you have to talk about your struggles Maye said because they all went through it with me.
Maye was born in Canada in 1948 and moved with her family to Pretoria South Africa at a very young age.
Along with her adventurous parents she grew up roaming the Kalahari Desert every winter in search of the Lost City of the Kalahari and traveling the world in a single engine prop plane.
I was never afraid on my trips to the desert because my dad and mom were in charge Maye wrote in the book.
Even when I was told a hyena could bite off my face I just closed my sleeping bag so that the hyena couldn t We learned to live without all the comforts of home.
When that s what you have to do it s what you do.
In 1970 Maye married Errol Musk a South African engineer at 22 and gave birth to Elon Kimbal and Tosca over the three ensuing years.
Her marriage hit a dead end not long after and the couple divorced in 1979.
Maye moved with the kids from Pretoria to Durban to run away from my husband she said.At 31 Maye found herself a single mom new in town with three young children.
She managed to raise them with an at home dietician practice and a part time modeling job.
Money was tight.
But life was good with family around.
We d buy second hand clothes.
We couldn t afford to go out and eat.
I fed them peanut butter sandwiches.
My kids loved it They didn t know they were deprived she recalled.Things took a heartbreaking turn in the early 1980s when Elon and Kimbal moved to stay with their father as a result of one of many nasty custody lawsuits between Maye and her ex husband.
He had different things to sue me about every year.
Within one week after every trial I d receive a subpoena for the next one.
It just never stopped Maye said.
When Elon was about 10 years old he said he s going to go live with his dad.
His father had theEncyclopaedia Britannica which I couldn t afford.
He also had a computer which was very rare at the time.
That s why Elon loved it.
Elon Musk and his mother Maye Musk in 1995.Courtesy of Maye MuskWhen Elon was young I noticed that he read everything Elon remembered everything he read.
He was always absorbing information.
We called Elon the encyclopedia because he had read the Encyclopedia Britannica and Colliers Encyclopedia and remembered everything.
That s also why we called him Genius Boy.
We could ask him anything.
Remember this was before the internet.
I guess now we would call him the internet.
A Women Makes a PlanMaye s post divorce legal war dragged on for a few more years until Elon and his younger siblings started their adult lives.
By 1989 Maye and all her three children had moved to Canada.Maye now lives in Los Angeles and travels frequently for modeling gigs and her consulting practice.
She drives a Tesla Model S and watchesSpaceX rocket launcheswhenever she can and gets nervous every time.When asked what she thinks of Elon s plan toretire on Marsone day she pondered for a few seconds and said he can do whatever he wants.
The adventurous blood runs deep in the Musk family.
Both Maye s parents as well as her ex husband s were self made entrepreneurs.
So are all of her four siblings and three children.
Maye s older brother Scott Haldeman is a neurologist and founder of World Spine Care an industry nonprofit her younger brother Lee heads a business school in South Africa and her two sisters Lynne and Kaye like their mother run dancing schools.
Our family motto was live dangerously carefully Maye wrote.
My father sought adventure but he knew to be ready for the unexpected.
Because of that I m always curious and willing to explore.
And I know that I can take a risk as long as I m prepared.
Any plan for her own retirement Nooo Maye responded almost dismissively.
My mother didn t retire until 96.
She s in a wheelchair now but still reads voraciously every day.

In fact Musk s thinking was that a major change was needed in education one which would enable students to be able to jobs in the future that doesn t exist today.
He has also seen a need for education that included showing students how to interact and work alongside robots a skill he says will be needed in the decades to come.
Because he notes humans are underrated but working with tech is a must.Elon Musk s School Had No CurriculumIn 2014 the Tesla co founder approached one of his son s Mirman teachers Josh Dahn to create an unconventional school that would offer an alternative type of schooling.
Musk s only directive around the design of the school was to make it great.
There were nolimitations on any mandated structure or curriculum.RELATED What Elon Musk s Kids Really Think About Their Controversial DadThe school funded by Musk featured no math music or sports lessons.
Rather according toThe Daily Beast students would work together on complex projects.
There were also no foreign language lessons offered based on Musk s philosophy that real time translation software will be available in the future making the need for learning different languages obsolete.Admission Was Exclusive... And Not Long LivedEntry into Ad Astra included a number of problems that prospective students had to complete in order to apply.
One of these featured a typical Musk twist Applicants had to select from a list of 11 fictional planets and choose which three would be best and which three were the worst options for a new human colony.With no term marks exciting problems solved in groups and subjects like robotics the whole concept was based on the idea of producing unique people not factory workers.RELATED These Huge Stars Were Once Expelled From SchoolThe revelry wouldn t last long though in May 2022 Josh Dahn the school s co founder announced that Ad Astra had changed.
Referring to the first school as an eight year experiment that served 50 students he introduced Astra Nova meaning New Star as an online school.Elon Musk s New School Model Is Online Only...The old school was completely free to students with Musk picking up the tab at a cost of 475 000 per year but the new Astra Nova is a traditional for profit business.
Students will pay 7 500 per year but classes only take place on Thursdays.The main difference between the two schools is that classes will now be offered online.
Astra Nova will accept applications from students across the world between the ages of 8 and 14.
In situ classes are only offered at home base in California students in other parts of the world interact together in live team games.Musk s Critics are saying the online option is a little incongruous given his recent ruling that Tesla employees are no longer allowed to work from home since the lifting of Covid restrictions.
It follows hiscontroversial 2020 move to keep the Tesla factory open amid mandatory closure.In June 2022 he issued an email that said employees had to show up for at least 40 hours a week in the main Tesla office.
It read Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth.
This will not happen by phoning it in.
Similar emails were sent to SpaceX.Musk Is No Longer Connected To The Running Of The SchoolAstra Nova founder Josh Dahn is quick to point out that Musk is no longer connected to the school.
Other than his initial assistance and funding Dahn has been running operations along with a specially selected staff.Students interested in attending the new online school have to submit a video response to a set problem.
The first of these under the title The Lake Conundrum looks at issues around manufacturing water contamination and pollution plus the added complication of corrupt bosses.As with the initial school it s futuristic.Perhaps it s best to end off with a message to prospective students from Josh Dahn which reads So I humbly welcome you to Astra Nova School an eight year experiment that has been the challenge and joy of my life.

Arstechnicarevealedthis week.
Musk started the school after pulling all of his sons out of Los Angeles private schools and hired one of his son s teachers to act as its principal.
And in true Musk fashion it s nothing like a school you went to.According to the Ars report the kids work together in teams and explore non traditional topics including robotics and how to handle artificial intelligence that could ultimately turn evil.
There are no grades given to students at the school and if the children don t like a particular class they re taking they can simply opt out.
Ars found that there are fewer than 40 students at the school including Musk s own kids.
The other students are children of SpaceX employees and other people from the Los Angeles area.Not surprisingly the school seems to focus its education on STEM.
But unlike other schools it doesn t teach music and sports and language arts appear to be an afterthought according to Ars.
The reason Musk thinks it s more important for children to learn other topics when computers can take up the task of translating language in the future.In the place of traditional education is a class that discusses the ethical and political woes of artificial intelligence a topic that Musk is deeply concerned about.
Students are also asked to make a variety of technologies like robots and even weather balloons.
And when students asked to make electromagnetic pulse technology the school graciously accepted Ars wrote.For now Ad Astra is only available to students between the ages of 7 and 14.
And since two of Musk s sons are leaving for traditional high schools next year there s some concern over what the future of the school looks like according to Ars.
But if anything is clear it s that Ad Astra is appealing to some.According to Ars approximately 400 families last year vied for just 12 open spots at Musk s school.Subscribe to Well Adjusted our newsletter full of simple strategies to work smarter and live better from the Fortune Well team.Sign up today.Read MoreArtificial IntelligenceCryptocurrencyMetaverseCybersecurityTech ForwardMost PopularFinanceA professional couple who make over 200 000 combined say it s hilarious to think they could afford a home in Los...April 10 2023BYAlena BotrosHealth Arcturus a highly transmissible COVID variant eyed by the WHO appears to have a new symptom.

Imagine this Three companies create a flying bicycle around the same time.
But one company AstraBike is slightly more successful than all the others because its design engineering manufacturing and marketing teams work so well together.
The competition is intense as the other two companies want to overtake AstraBike.
AstraBike has a difficult decision to make.
It only has enough money to grow one of its teams and if it chooses unwisely it may go out of business.
So which one should it pick Option A The design team.
If it grows the designers want to create a new product for the company a flying skateboard.
Option B The engineering team.
If it grows the engineers want to build a better version of the AstraBike that flies higher and goes faster.
Option C The manufacturing team.
If it grows the manufacturers want to create the AstraBike more quickly for less money.
Option D The marketing team.
If it grows the marketers want to use advertisements to make AstraBike known around the world.
So which team should AstraBike grow This isn t a job interview or an IQ test or a personality quiz.
This is what is called a Conundrum.
Though a student might encounter this problem or one like it in a public school classroom the Conundrum as defined here boasts nontraditional origins.
Look beyond the Conundrum and in the distance you ll glimpse SpaceX and yes Elon Musk.It s a Friday in May and class is about to begin.
Middle school age kids chatter swapping stories about their pets until it s time to work.
They re eager bright and funny typical kids enrolled in an anything but typical program.
This is Synthesis a course developed at the Astra Nova School.
On the school s website its credentials take the lead.
Born at SpaceX and small by design the school is all virtual meaning there are no physical classrooms for kids.
Today s class like all Synthesis and Astra Nova classes takes place on Zoom.
Students have logged in from all over the world to work on Conundrums like the tale of the flying bike.
They are drawn perhaps by Astra Nova s genesis briefly referenced on its website.
Astra Nova and Synthesis both grew out of Ad Astra the California based school for children of SpaceX employees.Ars Technicareported that in 2014 Musk pulled his five sons out of their elite private school and hired one of their teachers to design a new one that would exceed traditional school metrics on all relevant subject matter through unique project based learning experiences.
SpaceX families made up around half the student body the rest hailed from households in the Los Angeles area.
Parents waged fierce battles for the few spots available the WashingtonPostsaid it may be the most exclusive school in the world.
Ad Astra shuttered in 2020 and co founders Joshua Dahn Rosemary Rohde and Tara Safronoff pivoted to online teaching with the Astra Nova School.
The same year Dahn co founded Synthesis an enrichment program that was the school website says conceived at Ad Astra evolved at Astra Nova and brought to scale through a for profit company.Astra Nova is a bit different from its predecessor.
The school moved operations fully online this past academic year.
There are about 50 full time students and 125 who attend part time occasionally from around the world.
About half are homeschooled others attend regular public or private schools when they re not in class at Astra Nova.
The admissions process looks for students for whom Astra Nova would be substantially more enlivening than their current school or educational situation Dahn says.
The Astra Nova approach isn t for everyone and indeed it s not meant to be.
Dahn tells me that he doesn t believe online school works for all students and after two years of disrupted pandemic learning the average parent might agree.
Students who choose Astra Nova are a self selecting group inclined perhaps to succeed in this setting.
Prospective students must respond to a Conundrum and attend a demo day at the school.
A family interview is the last step in the process.
We do not care about IQ Dahn adds.
Elon will not be teaching your kids and we try to focus on what matters most.
ElonMusk asunderstoodby A baffled dazzled incredulous public.Hollywood.The towns and cities sold on a hyperloop.His romantic partners..Students at the tiny private school he inspired.His most ardent supporters.Wall Streeters who bet against him.His 18 000 tweets.His style sense.Today the controversial mogul has no ties to Astra Nova or Synthesis at all.
Yet to observe Dahn teaching is to search for traces of Ad Astra and perhaps Musk in his project s DNA.
Friday s Synthesis studentssoon get to work on a new Conundrum.
Unlike the hypothetical Flying Bike Conundrum the inspiration for the so called Closing Conundrum is based on stark reality.
Developed in conjunction with Hawthorne Elementary School in Elkhart Indiana a public school that has since closed after nearlya centuryin operation the Closing Conundrum asks students to decide who gets a say over the fate of the school.
Should it be the school board The community Parents Consultants Maybe Hawthorne s students themselves The kids prepare to choose three and after a few moments their results display on our screens Most think the school board should decide with students and parents in second and third place.
Consultants come in last.
The school board they reason was elected by the people to make difficult decisions.The Conundrums are bright and cheerily animated.
They re clearly aimed at kids though the conversations they inspire at times seem suited for a B school seminar.
In each a voice encourages students Imagine this and asks them to immerse themselves in a scenario.
The questions are open ended and there is never a wrong answer.
The point is to think but to think like who is the question.
It s an ambitious place designed for ambitious kids.
If you want your child to become the next Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos Astra Nova might be a good place to start.
In fact the school might be difficult to avoid.
Dahn says the Conundrums have been viewed in over 100 000 classrooms around the country.As Friday s class continues the kids turn to a pair of games.
Dahn explains later that Synthesis uses the games so students can feel the weight of powerful concepts like incentives risk scarcity and trade offs.
With the first game Hollywood they re tasked with launching their own sci fi film by purchasing scripts assembling a cast and developing a marketing budget.
They know more about the concept of silent partners than I do.
A second game Art for All asks students to assemble an exhibition of art through auctions and take it on a tour to different cities around the world Dahn explains.
A scoreboard tracks students attendance and profit and they re also judged on the quality of their art curation.
The school isn t accredited by any regulating body and it s difficult to gauge student progress by traditional metrics.
So what do the Conundrums or the Synthesis games accomplish Maybe the proof is in the kids themselves.
They work well together.
Dahn visits each breakout group to monitor its progress.
In class discussions the students tend to take the lead with Dahn offering the occasional correction or observation.
The kids mostly ignore me the stranger in their midst as they focus on each other and their tasks.The school s pedagogy is experimental Dahn says.
Families can choose which classes students take each term and the school appears eager to reach potential students.
Astra Nova aims to share any class experience experiment with students not in our school Dahn says.Intended for children of middle school age Astra Nova offers classes that many families can t access in traditional public private or homeschool settings.
Dahn tells me that staff co create the school with students tailoring it to their interests.
The school has offered courses in Shakespeare planetary science and bioethics through the lens of CRISPR the gene editing technology.
Full time students pay 32 500 a year to attend Astra Nova though Dahn says around 43 percent of full time students and 11 percent of part time students receive some form of financial aid.
Prospective students can learn something about the school from the Conundrums which it publishes on its website and makes available to schools through ClassDojo a popular digital platform for students and educators.Musk s name and image regularly appear in marketing for Synthesis I heard that Synthesis had something to do with Elon Musk a student says in one Facebook ad.
A video briefly shows Musk discussing the former Ad Astra school.
Yet Dahn sounds frustrated with the sensational headlines engendered by the defunct school s association with Musk.
In a letter on the school s website he says there were no flamethrowers at Ad Astra as one article reported.
It was secretive because it wasn t properly zoned hewrites.To me he says that what made Ad Astra special was much simpler and far less dramatic we had a directive to go out and create something new and worthwhile.
Dahn who has also worked for Teach for America and later at a school for gifted children where he first encountered Musk s family adds Since very few educators are given anything like this level of autonomy or opportunity our hope is that our work at Astra Nova even in some small way is useful to educators and parents looking to try something different.
When Ad Astra began Dahn tells me the prevailing directive from Musk was to figure it out and make it great.
At Astra Nova that mentality is still intact.
Yet Musk s influence might not end there.
The school probably wouldn t exist without him and it s banking still that students and families still think he s a genius or at least a savvy businessman even as he undercuts his claim to either characterization.
It s too early to tell if Astra Nova will produce the next Musk but the promise hangs in the air shaping ad copy and maybe minds too.
Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it the Bible says.
For Astra Nova the verse might as well be marketing copy.Sign Up forCourt Appearances Twitterv.MuskA newsletter by Intelligencer s Kevin T.

Ad Astra The Secret School Elon Musk Started To Save His Kids From Standard EducationNewsPublic School NewsSchool Choice NewsHomeschool NewsCollege NewsBad TeachersKnowledgeEducation TerminologyCurriculumAd Astra The Secret School Elon Musk Started To Save His Kids From Standard EducationO of Tesla and SpaceX Elon Musk views life.
It is also the perfect name for the self described mysterious and disruptive school he started.ByRick Gonzales Published1 year agoRelated Kanye West Says His New Private School Will Turn Kids Into GeniusesIn Latin Ad Astra means toward the stars which is the perfect description of how the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX Elon Musk views life.
It is also the perfect name for the self described mysterious and disruptive school he started.On a number of occasions Elon Musk has criticized America seducational systembut instead of continuing to make complaints he s doing something about it.
In 2014 the billionaire philanthropist put his money where his Twitter fingers were and came up with Ad Astra.
Ad Astra is an innovative school with its own system in place one that Musk says allows kids in based on their aptitudes.
Indeed there are no qualifications instead of treating the school as an assembly line I think it makes more sense to attend to education to match your skills and student abilities Musk said in a 2015 interview that took place in Beijing China.
While describing Ad Astra s educational model he said it would focus on skills.
He touched on three things The school would be an alternative to age segregation.
One thing Musk doesn t agree with in America s educational system is the separation of children based on age.
He feels it doesn t make sense for children as they have different interests and abilities that are not defined by age.Problem solving would be the focus.
Musk feels that children should be taught how to solve problems instead of giving them their tools in a vacuum.Gamification.
Musk sees games that children play in a different light.
He says he never has to encourage his kids to play games and that games are the natural way to educate children.Elon Musk created this school for his five boys twins Griffin and Xavier and triplets Damian Saxon and Kai.
He also has a sixth boy X AE A XII Musk good luck with that pronunciation who comes from his former relationship with Canadian singer Grimes Claire Boucher .X AE A XII Musk is waiting in the wings to join the Ad Astra when old enough.Elon Musk s school was created by Musk and Joshua Dahn a former teacher at the prestigiousMirman School for Gifted Childrenin Beverly Hills California.
Their first iteration of the Ad Astra school was small consisting of 8 kids.
The location was also small located in a conference room at SpaceX.Elon Musk s school soon grew to 20 students and presently they are at 40 students.
The students range in ages from 7 to 14 but are never separated by these ages.
They are taught to work together as teams regardless of age.At first Elon Musk opened up his school to his children and some children of SpaceX employees.
It was never said which employees were offered this opportunity for their children how many of them or under what conditions would apply.The subjects at Elon Musk s school as you may imagine are quite different than what the normal educational system promotes and teaches.
The students study applied science Artificial Intelligence design and coding with a heavy influence on the creation of robots.What you will not see at Ad Astra are students involved in sports learning foreign languages or even music.
Musk no longer feels it s necessary to learn a foreign language in school because real time translation software is becoming more popular and developed.So what brought Elon Musk to the decision to create this specialized school As mentioned the American education system was a big turn off for the billionaire but it does go deeper.
I hated going to school when I was little it was torture says Musk.
He also confessed that he wasbulliedtremendously in school as a child growing up in South Africa.Though Elon Musk has now moved to Texas the Ad Astra school remains at the California SpaceXfacility.
Obtaining information about the school or trying to get in might be more difficult than winning the lotto.

Christina Simon author of thebookBeyond the Brochure An Insider s Guide to Private Elementary Schools in Los Angeles says she receives numerous emails from parents who desire to enroll their children but have no idea how to.
They are not concerned about what the school is like how many teachers it has or how it works information that you normally want to know before choosing your children s school.
Only that it is about Elon Musk said Simon viaEntrepreneur.Don t plan on the school growing much more than the present 40 students.

PETER PARKS AFP Getty Images ByLevi Sumagaysay Bay Area News GroupPUBLISHED June 27 2018 at 12 40 p.m.
UPDATED June 28 2018 at 3 54 a.m.For better or worse Elon Musk often schools the masses on Twitter.
He also helps school children at SpaceX that is he provides an education for them apparently free of charge.Musk s sons go to the school called Ad Astra according to a new report that has shed more light on the school this week.
And as you might imagine Ad Astra which operates in a corner at Musk s space company in Hawthorne California is not your average school.For one thing there are no grades Ars Technica reports.
Also missing music and sports and language education reportedly falls by the wayside.
It does have a chemistry lab Mac laptops for every child and food trucks for after school.The school has not exactly been a secret.
The guy who runs it Joshua Dahn talked with X Prize Foundation founder Peter Diamandis in an interview that s beenon YouTubesince last year.Ad Astra is project based and has a curriculum that changes every year and that relies on student input.
Current projects include environmental policy space exploration and North Korea according to Ars Technica.The school has operated for four years and has fewer than 40 students including Musk s five sons kids of SpaceX employees and a few other children from Los Angeles.Get tech news in your inbox weekday mornings.Sign upfor the free Good Morning Silicon Valley newsletter.Ars Technicaobtained a 2015 tax filing with the IRS that shows Musk as the principal officer of the nonprofit school and which states Ad Astra s purpose The primary exempt purpose of this organization is to meet the specific education needs of children with extraordinary academic potential.
The filing also goes into more detail about the school such as that it is an elementary and middle school and places a heavy emphasis on science math engineering and ethics.
It also never expects to grow to more than 50 students according to the filing.
The goal of the school is to develop remarkable people inbued sic with a strong sense of justice who are equipped with the critical thinking skills necessary to make a difference the filing also states.According to the filing Musk gave Ad Astra 475 000 in 2014 and 2015.
His contributions are treated as tuition equivalent payments for his children who attend the school.As for Musk s own childhood and schooling a biography of the billionaire businessman gives a mixed account.Musk has a photographic memory and was a bookworm when he was growing up and going to school in South Africa according to journalist Ashlee Vance s Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future which was published in 2015.
Musk his brother and sister and cousins grew up making rockets and dabbling in entrepreneurship.
He was bright but didn t always get the best grades.
But his obvious smarts and awkwardness seemed to contribute to him being bullied in school which included a physical beating that sent him to the hospital.
It was just like nonstop horrible for a few years Musk told Vance.The intense staff to student ratio noted in Ad Astra s filing may help prevent a repeat of what Musk had to go through.Now the question is what will happen to the school as Musk s sons age out.
For example two of his sons are 14 and will need to go on to high school the Ars Technica report notes.
Or will they This is Musk after all and he might just find a way to keep them at Ad Astra.Report an errorPolicies and StandardsContact UsTags Elon MuskK 12 EducationSiliconBeatLevi Sumagaysay Tech writer and editorLevi Sumagaysay is a tech reporter and editor for the Mercury News.

Elon Musk is also not a lucky traveler.
In the last 12 years I only tried to take a week off twice Musk said.Both of which can be described asending in disaster.

The lesson here is don t take a week off Musk says.Photo The GuardianAfter this statement Musk and his wife took a honeymoon vacation to Brazil and South Africa.

After that he went on to start X.com which eventually became PayPal.
In 2002 eBay purchased PayPal for 1.5 billion.In 2002 he founded SpaceX which is worthan estimated 33 billion and in 2003 he founded Tesla which has a currentmarket cap of about 57 billion.Though Musk had much success he has not had a lot of time off.
In fact according to Musk vacations will kill you.
Why the aversion to vacations It s partially due to work.
Musk said onRecode Decodethat to successfully build his start ups he would have to work over 100 hours a week.And not much has changed.In 2018 for example Musk wassleeping on the Tesla factory floorin an effort to catch up production on the Model 3 cars.
I don t have time to go home and shower he told Gayle King on CBS This Morning.
I don t believe people should be experiencing hardship while the CEO is like off on vacation he said.In addition to working all the time Musk who says he has only tried to take off a handful of times has had terrible luck when it comes to vacations.In 2015 Musk said that he had only taken off twice in more than a decade and both times were problematic.
In the last 12 years I only tried to take a week off twice he said in2015 on Danish television.
The first time I took a week off theOrbital Sciences rocket explodedand Richard Branson s Virgin Galactic rocket exploded in that same week.
The second time I took a week off my rocket exploded Musk said.
The lesson here is don t take a week off.
Even before that when Musk tried to take his first adult vacation his honeymoon with first wife Justine in September 2000 he got bad professional news.At the time he was CEO of X.com and company executives were not pleased with his leadership.
While Musk was on the plane with Justine executives delivered a letter of no confidence to the company s board pushing Musk out as CEO and replacing him with Peter Thiel.
When he arrived for his honeymoon in Sydney Australia Musk had to immediately fly back to Palo Alto California according to the book Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future by Ashlee Vance.But perhaps Musk s most traumatic vacation experience came when he and Justine decided to try and go on their honeymoon again that December.Musk planned a two week trip to Brazil and South Africa.
While in South Africa Musk contracted the most severe form ofmalaria.
After two hospitals misdiagnosed him he came very close to dying said Musk in Elon Musk before being properly treated in the nick of time.
That s my lesson for taking a vacation Musk said in the book.
Vacations will kill you.
Since Musk s disastrous trips he has reportedly been on at least two vacations includingone to Chileand one toAustralia.Like this story Subscribe to CNBC Make It on YouTube Don t miss Elon Musk asks this simple interview question to tell when an applicant is lyingElon Musk Bill Gates and Warren Buffett agree Now is the best time to be aliveProductivity tips from Elon Musk Jeff Bezos and Steve JobsVIDEO0 5000 50Billionaire Elon Musk responds to unhappy Tesla customerMake ItStay in the loopGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inboxSign UpAbout UsLearn more about the world of CNBC Make ItLearn MoreFollow UsCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel 2023CNBC LLC.
