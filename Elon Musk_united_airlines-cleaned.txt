Entrepreneur and its related marks are registered trademarks of Entrepreneur Media Inc.HomeHomeGreen EntrepreneurHere s What Elon Musk Really Thinks About Climate ChangeWhile the Tesla CEO strongly believes in global warming he s had more controversial views on combating the crisis.ByRyan Droste Jan 11 2023ShareOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.Where is Elon Musk on the climate change issue While the world s second richest man has strongly advocated for fighting against global warming over the years his thoughts on reversing the trend have varied.
Climate change is the biggest threat that humanity faces this century except for AI Musk toldRolling Stonein 2018.
I keep telling people this.
I hate to be Cassandra here but it s all fun and games until somebody loses a f ing eye.
Musk s concern about the climate is shared by 72 of Americans according toa survey by Yale University.
Another survey by the American Association for the Advancement of Science survey found that about 97 of climate scientists concluded that human caused climate change is happening.
A pioneer in clean energyMusk s actions as an entrepreneur demonstrate a strong commitment to sustainability.In 2008 Musk became CEO of Tesla now the world s largest electric vehicle producer.
Additionally in 2016 Tesla acquired SolarCity a company started by Musk s cousins for 2.6 billion.
SolarCity was reorganized into Tesla Energy a clean energy subsidiary of Tesla Inc.What was the motivation behind investing in Tesla The fundamental intention of Tesla at least my motivation was to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy he said.
That s why I open sourced the patents.
It s the only way to transition to sustainable energy better.
Related Elon Musk Was Right To Ban Remote Work.
Here s WhyMusk is funding a 100 million carbon removal competitionMusk has consistently funded efforts to fight global warming.The Musk Foundation is involved with theXPrize Carbon Removal Program which is funding a carbon removal competition between teams across the globe.
According to the website the goal is to fight climate and rebalance the Earth s carbon cycle and the prize is listed as the largest incentive prize in history.
We want teams to build real systems that can make a measurable impact at a gigaton level.
Whatever it takes.
Time is of the essence Musk said.Musk on the risks of climate changeMusk has repeatedly warned about the risks of climate change to humanity.
In 2015 he made a head turning speech on the subject atParis Sorbonne University.
If we wait and delay the change away from fossil fuels the best case is simply delaying the inevitable transition from sustainable energy.
This is the best case if we don t take action now he said.
The worst case however is more displacement and destruction than all the wars in history combined.
These are the best and worst case scenarios.
This is why I call it the dumbest experiment in history.
He imagined the possibility of 5 to 10 of the Earth s landmass being absorbed by water concluding ominously that we would be talking about maybe two billion people being displaced and their homes being destroyed and their countries being gone.
So I think we should take action.
Musk said he thought the government needed to play a role in changing the course.
There needs to be a clear message from government in this regard Musk said.
Because the fundamental problem is the rules today incent people to create carbon.
This is madness.
Whatever you incent will happen.
That is why we are seeing very little effect thus far.
The government is the setter of rules the government decides what rules the companies play by.
And if we currently have a system that massively incentivizes bad behavior.
Musk on the Paris Climate AccordsIn the early days of the Trump Administration Musk was part of two advisory councils to the former president.
ButMusk left the councilsafter Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accords.
The Accords include commitments from all countries to reduce their emissions and work together to adapt to the impacts of climate change and calls on countries to strengthen their commitments over time.
Climate change is real.
Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world Muskwrote on Twitter.Related What Skills Does Elon Musk Have and Why Is He So Successful Musk on the Biden Administration plans for tackling climate changeAs the Biden Administration took over the White House in 2021 Musk toldFortunethat he was excited about the new president s goals in tackling the climate crisis.
I think this is great.
I feel very optimistic about the future of sustainable energy with the new administration Musk said.
Not that we should get complacent or anything but the wind is at our back for solving the climate crisis with the new administration.
Musk bristles at government spending on climate changeBut as the details of the Biden Administration s Build Back Better bill surfaced Musk began to have a change of heart about the administration.
Despite the bill s provisions on climate change Musk told the Wall Street Journal I would just can this whole bill.
That s my recommendation.
Why was he against it Musk expressed concern about the amount of government spending required and how it would affect the deficit.
Do we need federal support for gas stations We don t. So there s no need for this for support for a charging network.
I would delete it.
Delete.
It might be better if the bill doesn t pass because we ve spent so much money you know it s like the federal budget deficit is insane he added.Musk on a carbon taxMusk has consistently favored a carbon tax which is a tax on fossil fuels especially those used by motor vehicles intended to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide.During aFebruary 2021 interviewwith Joe Rogan Musk once again declared that he favored a carbon tax.
Muskhad alsodiscussed a carbon tax at the World Energy Innovation Forum in 2016 noting that a revolt against the fossil fuel industry was needed.
My top recommendation honestly would be just add a carbon tax Musk told Rogan.
The economy works great.
Prices and money are just information.
If the price is wrong the economy doesn t do the right thing.
Musk said he wanted to make sure the tax was non regressive based on income level so that lower wage earners do not pay a higher rate than higher wage earners.
He also floated the idea of tax rebates for lower wage workers.
If we just put a price on carbon emissions the market will react in a sensible way.
But because we don t have a price on it it is behaving badly Musk said.Musk said that he had spoken with the Biden Administration about a carbon tax but he said that the White House told him it would be too difficult politically to get through.
However Biden s Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has been vocalabout her support for a carbon tax.Related 61 Books Elon Musk Thinks You Should ReadMusk vs. Bill Gates on climate actionMusk and Bill Gates are two of the richest men in the world.
Both have overwhelming resources to devote to fighting climate change.
But each man has taken different routes to help with the crisis and these differences have caused a feud.Gates has criticized Muskfor his endeavors with exploring outer space rather than using that money for work here on Earth while Musk has criticized Gates strategies and his financial dealings with Tesla.
In brief Gates owns a half a billion short position on Tesla.This came to a head when Gates reached out to Musk about working together on climate change.
Musk shut down the proposition pretty quickly.In aleaked text message exchange which was later confirmed by Musk as authentic Musk replied to Gates Sorry but I cannot take your philanthropy on climate change seriously when you have a massive short position against Tesla the company doing the most to solve climate change.
Musk now believes there are bigger problems than global warmingAlthough Musk declared in 2018 that climate change was the most significant threat humanity would face this century his views seemed to have changed by the summer of 2022 at least regarding global warming.On July 15th Musk tweeted Tesla is to protect life on Earth SpaceX to extend life beyond.
However just over one month later on August 25 Musk tweeted Population collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming.
Mark these words.

His success as a serial entrepreneur though follows an eventful childhood in which a young Musk played with homemade rockets coded his own video games and endured hardships both at school and home.Here are eight things you might not know about Musk s youth.1.
He went door to door selling candy to rich peopleWhile growing up in Pretoria Musk his brother Kimbal and their cousins traveled around the wealthy parts of the South African capital selling homemade chocolate Easter eggs.The adventurous group traveled door to door selling the sweets for 20 times the cost of making them.VIDEO1 0201 02Elon Musk s brother says this is how you raise entrepreneurial kidsMake It Voices I d make them for 50 cents and charge 10 for an Easter egg and I d always get this question like Why are you charging 10 for this little Easter egg said Kimbalto CNBC Make It in a 2017 interview.
And I was like Well you re supporting a young capitalist.
And the reality is if you don t buy it from me you re not going to get one and I know you can afford 10.
2.
He was bulliedMusk has been open about his difficult childhood discussing it most recently in last Sunday s 60 Minutes interview.
While he attended grade school in Pretoria South Africa Musk was not only theyoungest and smallest kid in his class but he was nerdier and muchmore into booksthan manyjocks at school.In Ashlee Vance s 2015 book Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future Musk said gangs of boys at would sometimes hunt him down going so far as to push him down a flight of stairs in one instance and send him to the hospital.
I was almost beaten to death he addedon 60 Minutes.
The bullying continueduntil he was 15 years old when went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself by doing karate judo and wrestling.
By 16 he said he was dishing it out as hard as they d give it to me.
3.
His parents thought he was deafMusk was so introspective as a kid that his parents and doctors ordered tests to check if he was deaf.
His mother Maye Musk eventually learned this was his way of daydreaming about his inventions.
He goes into his brain and then you just see he is in another world.
He still does that.
Now I just leave him be because I know he is designing a new rocket or something recalled Maye Musk in Vance s book.Though this bothered his peers who could reportedly yell at him and do jumping jacks beside him and he wouldn t notice Musk s pensive moments allowed him to visualize projects he d hope to tackle.4.
He made his own explosives and rocketsWhile his parents were away Musk lived mostly under the watch of a housekeeper.
According to Musk she was mainly there to make sure he didn t break anything.VIDEO1 5701 57The one trait that Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have in commonThe Definitive Guide to Business She wasn t like watching me.
I was off making explosives and reading books and building rockets and doing things that could have gotten me killed said Musk.
I m shocked that I have all my fingers.
5.
He had a penchant for readingThroughout his childhood books played a crucial role in fueling Musk s ambitions and entertaining him.Said Musk I was raised by books.
Books and then my parents.
He reportedly read the entire Encyclopedia Britannicaat age nineand would pore over science fiction novels comics and nonfiction books for up to 10 hours a day.
Some of themost influential books he readincluded The Lord of the Rings The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and Isaac Asimov s Foundation series.6.
He coded his own video game at 12 and got 500 for itIn the early days of computer coding a 12 year old Musk built a Blastar a science fiction inspired space game.
Similar to the classic Space Invaders arcade game the objective in Blastar was to destroy an alien spacecraft carrying deadly bombs.Although he s since called it atrivial game Blastar earned Musk an easy 500 after a South African trade publication published its source code.7.
He was master at Dungeons DragonsAlong with his cousins Musk loved playing the fantasy role playing game.
One time the teens went to Johannesburg for a Dungeons Dragons tournament.
That was us being nerd masters supremes Musk told Vance.VIDEO1 2901 29Ex Google exec 3 traits that make Elon Musk an exceptional leader and one major flawThe Definitive Guide to BusinessAccording to his cousin Peter Rive Musk helped their team win the tournament with his incredible imagination and ability to keep people captivated and inspired.
8.
He tried opening his own video arcade at 16Along with his younger cousins and Kimbal Muskgot the idea to open an arcadeby their high school according to Vance s book.
They got as far as signing a lease setting contracts together filling out forms at the city planning department.
But their plans were foiled when the city told them they were too young to get a real estate permit without an adult to sign off.According to Kimbal both his father and uncle flipped out when they brought up their arcade plans.9.
He moved to North America as a teenagerOnce Elon reached his teens he moved from his native South Africa tobegin his college studiesin North America.
At 17 he first emigrated to see what it takes to live he told Neil DeGrasse Tysonon StarTalk Radio.
Musk found that in America it s pretty easy to keep yourself alive.
Given that his threshold for existing was pretty low Musk was determined to survive on 1 a day by buying food at the supermarket in bulk.
I went more for the hotdogs and oranges you do get really tired of hot dogs and oranges after a while said Musk.
mixing things up every now and then with some pasta and green pepper and a big thing of sauce which he said could go pretty far too.

He tosses satellites into orbit and harnesses the sun he drives a car he created that uses no gas and barely needs a driver.
With a flick of his finger the stock market soars or swoons.
An army of devotees hangs on his every utterance.
He dreams of Mars as he bestrides Earth square jawed and indomitable.
Lately Elon Muskalso likes to live tweet his poops.
Just dropping some friends off at the pool the 50 year old zillionaire informed his 66 million Twitter followers on the evening of Nov. 29 having previously advised that at least half his tweets were made on a porcelain throne.
After an interval 21 minutes if you must know an update Splish splash.
Sometimes I do hit some resonant notes with respect to humor Musk says of his puerile expressions.
It s a warm windy December day at Starbase his new rocket fabrication and launch facility at the southern tip of Texas.
Two of his Starship rockets gleaming pointy nosed 160 ft. stainless steel silos are silhouetted behind him in the setting sun.
But you know not all jokes land.
This is the manwho aspires to save our planet and get us a new one to inhabit clown genius edgelord visionary industrialist showman cad a madcap hybrid of Thomas Edison P.T.
Barnum Andrew Carnegie andWatchmen s Doctor Manhattan the brooding blue skinned man god who invents electric cars and moves to Mars.
His startup rocket company SpaceX has leapfrogged Boeing and others to own America s spacefaring future.
His car company Tesla controls two thirds of the multibillion dollar electric vehicle market it pioneered and is valued at a cool 1 trillion.
That has made Musk with a net worth of more than 250 billion the richest private citizen in history at least on paper.
He s a player in robots and solar cryptocurrency and climate brain computer implants to stave off the menace of artificial intelligence and underground tunnels to move people and freight at super speeds.
He dominates Wall Street The way finance works now is that things are valuable not based on their cash flows but on their proximity to Elon Musk Bloomberg columnist Matt Levinewrote in February after Musk s Gamestonk tweet vaulted the meme stock craze into the stratosphere.Photograph by Mark Mahaney for TIMEMusk has spent a lifetime defying the haters now it seems he s finally in position to put them in their place.
For 2021 was the year of Elon Unbound.
In April SpaceX won NASA sexclusive contractto put U.S. astronauts on the moon for the first time since 1972.
In May Musk hostedSaturday Night Live.In October car rental giant Hertz announced it planned to add 100 000 Teslas to its fleet.
The juvenile missives from his unmistakably phallic Twitter avatar came days after one of his rockets launched NASA s first antiasteroid planetary defense test a few weeks before another launched a first of its kind mission to study cosmic X rays and amid Musk s sale of 10 of his Tesla stock a process that roiled markets cost him billions and should produce enough tax revenue to fund the Commerce Department for a year.
The sale was prompted by a Twitter poll Musk posted in a fit of pique over liberal Senators proposals to tax billionaires.Many people are described as larger than life but few deserve it.
How many of us truly exceed our life span How many will make it into the digital textbooks our spacefaring descendants will study As Shakespeare observed inJulius Caesar it s far easier to be remembered for doing evil than doing good.
How many will leave a mark on the world much less the universe for their contributions rather than their crimes A few short years ago Musk was roundly mocked as a crazy con artist on the verge of going broke.
Now this shy South African with Asperger s syndrome who escaped a brutal childhood and overcame personal tragedy bends governments and industry to the force of his ambition.Musk at the Tesla Gigafactory in Gr nheide Germany on oct. 9Patrick Pleul Picture Alliance DPA APTo Musk his vast fortune is a mere side effect of his ability not just to see but to do things others cannot in arenas where the stakes are existential.
He was raised in a tough environment and born with a very special brain says Antonio Gracias Musk s close friend of two decades who has held seats on the boards of Tesla and SpaceX.
Ninety nine point nine percent of people in that situation don t come out of it.
Some small percentage come out of it with the ability he has to make great decisions under extraordinary pressure and the never ending drive to change the course of humanity.
Such cosmic ambition rarely comes without consequences and Musk still must answer to earthly authorities.
His companies have faced allegations of sexual harassment and poor working conditions in October a federal jury ordered Tesla to pay 137 million to a Black employee who accused the automaker of ignoring racial abuse.
The businesses have also been fined for numerous regulatory violations.
The feds are probing Tesla s Autopilot software which has been involved in an alarming number of crashes with parked emergency vehicles resulting in injuries and death.
The company s expansion in China required cozying up to its repressive autocrats.The toll his hard driving style takes on staff is legendary.
Former associates have described Musk as petty cruel and petulant particularly when frustrated or challenged.
He recently separated from the experimental musician Grimes the mother of his seventh son.
He is a savant when it comes to business but his gift is not empathy with people says his brother and business partner Kimbal Musk.
During the COVID 19 pandemic he s made statements downplaying the virus broken local health regulations to keep his factories running and amplified skepticism about vaccine safety.
Musk tells TIME he and his eligible children are vaccinated and that the science is unequivocal but that he opposes vaccine mandates You are taking a risk but people do risky things all the time he says of the unvaccinated.
I believe we ve got to watch out for the erosion of freedom in America.
The vast expanse of human misery can seem an afterthought to a man with his eyes on Mars.Musk is easily cast as a hubristic supervillain lumped in with the tech bros and space playboys for whom money is scorekeeping and rockets are the ultimate toy.
But he s different he s a manufacturing magnate moving metal not bytes.
His rockets built from scratch on an autodidact s mold breaking vision have saved taxpayers billions reinvigorated America s space dreams and are launching satellites to expand Internet access across the globe.
If Tesla delivers on its pledges it has the potential to strike a major blow against global warming.
The man from the future where technology makes all things possible is a throwback to our glorious industrial past before America stagnated and stopped producing anything but rules restrictions limits obstacles and Facebook.
He is a humanist not in the sense of being a nice person because he isn t says Robert Zubrin founder of the Mars Society who met Musk in 2001 when the young newly minted dot com millionaire sent a large unsolicited check to the organization.
He wants eternal glory for doing great deeds and he is an asset to the human race because he defines a great deed as something that is great for humanity.
He is greedy for glory.
Money to him is a means not an end.
Who today evaluates Thomas Edison on the basis of which of his inventions turned a profit For all his outlier qualities Musk also embodies the zeitgeist of this liminal age.
This was the year we emerged from the hundred year plague only to find there was no normal to go back to a year that felt like the cusp of a brave or terrifying new world with nobody in charge and everything up for renegotiation from how we work and travel to what we find meaning in and cherish.
Musk is our avatar of infinite possibility our usher to the remade world where shopworn practices are cast aside and the unprecedented becomes logical where Earth and humanity can still be saved.
Perhaps no one man should have all that power.
Perhaps this vision of the greater good comes with a human cost.
But if many never voted or signed up for Musk s wild zero gravity ride that is of no consequence to him.Musk ducks his large frame under the massive steel ring that holds the tallest most powerful rocket ever designed and peers up at the dozens of engine nozzles that will power it.
His fluffy little gray dog Marvin follows close behind the heels of his black cowboy boots which Musk has paired with a black Tom Ford jacket and black jeans.
His excited technical patter suddenly goes quiet he sees something up in the gnarled mass of metal tubes that displeases him.
If one engine catches fire he explains we want to ensure that fire does not spread through the entire volume.
There are barriers between the engines for this purpose but he s not convinced they re sufficient.Musk has a soft handshake and an even voice that expresses exasperation joy and breathtaking ambition in the same quiet register.
Tesla may be the principal source of his stupendous wealth and fame as well as his greatest impact on the planet to date.
But it is space that animates his wildest most extreme ambitions.
Musk s toddler X A Xii pronounced X has recently started sayingcar to which his father responds Rocket The goal overall has been to make life multi planetary and enable humanity to become a spacefaring civilization Musk says not because it would be profitable but because it would be exciting at least to him.
And the next really big thing is to build a self sustaining city on Mars and bring the animals and creatures of Earth there.
Sort of like a futuristic Noah s ark.
We ll bring more than two though it s a little weird if there s only two.
How Musk can believe something so improbable is easier to understand when you learn just how unlikely his current spacefaring success has been.
Before it was America s passport to the solar system SpaceX nearly bankrupted Musk.
Its first rocket the Falcon failed three times before reaching orbit in 2008.
The company proceeded to create the Falcon 9 and then theFalcon Heavy which has three clusters of nine engines.
Clustering engines was previously considered a bad idea because of the number of moving parts that can go explosively wrong one of many assumptions Musk upended.
When I first looked at the clustering of engines on the Falcon 9 I had to roll my eyes says Scott Pace director of George Washington University s Space Policy Institute.
But that s why Elon Musk is smarter than me.
A Falcon 9 rocket lifts off on April 23 carrying a crew to the space stationESA Eyevine ReduxRockets also weren t supposed to fly more than once.
For decades spent rocket stages were abandoned to the sea.
No one has ever made a fully reusable orbital rocket of any kind whatsoever Musk says.
We just live on a planet where this is an extremely difficult job.
He describes the challenge with evident relish.
It s like if this was a video game the setting is on maximum but not impossible.
In the past six years SpaceX has successfully landed the first stage of 90 of its Falcon 9 rockets and reflown 72 of them.
Musk has yet to achieve full reusability by reflying both rocket stages.Before Musk America s space industry was moribund.
In 2011 NASA mothballed the last space shuttle after inking a deal with SpaceX to make uncrewed cargo resupply runs to the International Space Station ISS .
SpaceX made its first such trip in 2012 two years ahead of the competition and in 2014 NASA tapped the company and behemoth Boeing to fly crews to the ISS.
SpaceX launched its first crew to the ISS aboard a Dragon spacecraft in May 2020.
Boeing delayed by development problems is not planning even an uncrewed test flight until next year.For the Dragon Musk swept away old school instrument panels and replaced them with three oversize touch screens.
There s no control stick the spacecraft s attitude orbit and re entry engines are all governed by the screens.
Astronaut Doug Hurley commander of the first crewed Dragon flight worried the screens would delay reaction times but SpaceX solved this by making Dragon an automated ship.
There s no plans to do any more manual flying certainly on the NASA missions Hurley says unless there s a need for it from a systems failure kind of scenario.
Success has not dampened Musk s appetite for risk.
After being lofted into space by a Falcon Super Heavy his next rocket theStarship will light out for the moon land there take off and return to Earth with no stages expended on the lunar journey.
This so called single stage to orbit model has been the white whale of rocket designers for generations.
In test flights four prototype Starships exploded on landing before a successful test last May.
For NASA and most private aerospace companies a single crash is a setback that can take years to recover from.
SpaceX works more like a Silicon Valley startup where the goal is to fail quickly and iterate.
This gets expensive fast.
Over Thanksgiving Musk emailed employees that Starship s new Raptor engine was facing a production crisis that could bankrupt SpaceX if it did not achieve a Starship flight rate of at least once every two weeks next year.
In a worst case situation he tells TIME bankruptcy is not out of the question not that it s likely.
The point he says was to remind staff that we cannot lose our edge or get complacent.
With its Starlink program SpaceX hopes to launch a constellation of as many as 42 000 satellites to provide Internet service to the world.
But that kind of orbiting swarm wreaks havoc on sky gazing.
Just how much stuff do you want to put up there asks Neal Lane senior fellow in science and technology at Rice University.
The astronomers are appropriately making noise about interfering with their ability to observe.
Gwynne Shotwell SpaceX s president tells TIME the company is working on the problem.
In April NASA selected SpaceX to build the lunar lander for the Artemis program thanks in part to a lowball 2.9 billion bid.
A bid by Jeff Bezos Blue Origin came in at more than twice that.
Bezos sued accusing Musk of undercutting the competition.
Musk took the opportunity to rub his victory in the face of the world s second richest man If lobbying lawyers could get u to orbit Bezos would be on Pluto he tweeted.
In November the federal claims court ruled in Musk s favor.Sometime in the next month or two Musk hopes to launch the Starship into orbit for the first time powered by 33 engines at the base of an enormous 230 ft. steel tube containing nearly 7.5 million lb.
of supercooled liquid fuel.
I think we can do a loop around the moon maybe as soon as 2023 he says and land on the moon s surface within three years.Rocket at Starbase the SpaceX launch site in Boca Chica TexasMark Mahaney for TIMESpaceX is a private company so whether it s profitable is not publicly known.
Note TIME s co owners Marc and Lynne Benioff have invested in companies connected to space exploration including SpaceX.
They have no involvement in TIME s editorial decisions.
But that s not the point Musk says.
One day he hopes the rockets will carry 100 people at a time to Mars where the ships can be refilled with fuel manufactured on the Red Planet and shuttled back to Earth.
Asked when he sees this happening Musk pauses for a long moment as if calculating all the variables federal regulations and production schedules test flight targets and bathroom requirements.
I ll be surprised if we re not landing on Mars within five years he finally says.What will humans do there and for how long We have had little use for the moon since landing there 50 years ago.
Musk argues that interplanetary life is the next great leap of evolution like the emergence of multicellular organisms and also that Mars could provide a home for humanity if Earth becomes uninhabitable.
Experts aren t so sure.
I have real doubts about the viability of a large settlement on Mars says John Logsdon founder of Space Policy Institute.
What would people do there to earn a living What would be the basis of a Mars economy Musk is not deterred.
Gamboling around the concrete slab littered with massive machines of his own creation Musk acknowledges his latest rocket could go the way of his first three.
I wouldn t say that our odds of getting to orbit the first time are high he says.
I would say optimistically it s 50 .
The dark surface of the Gulf stretches over his shoulder cell phones here pick up signals from Mexico a stone s throw away.
How does it feel to think about the most powerful rocket ever built exploding in a billion dollar fireball Pretty scary he says grinning.
So excitement guaranteed on launch day Then the tour is over.
Musk turns whistles to Marvin and strides briskly to his waiting Tesla.Electric cars like homemade rockets were a graveyard of well intentioned investment before Musk barreled into an industry in which he had no academic training.
For decades legacy automakers had stymied the development of electric vehicles lobbying against fuel efficiency standards and filing lawsuits against state mandates to develop the cars.
Tesla s business was sustained in part by generous support from the federal government though the company got off the ground before it became available.
A 465 million federal loan in 2010 helped prop up Tesla at a crucial juncture and its customers have benefitted from hefty tax incentives.Musk believed from the start that advances in lithium ion battery technology made long range electric vehicles possible.
In practice it wasn t that easy.
Tesla s first decade was plagued by unmet deadlines technical snafus and cost overruns.
During the 2008 financial crisis cash was so tight the company came within days of missing payroll.
With a dwindling fortune Musk borrowed 20 million from SpaceX to loan the company cajoled another 20 million out of investors and raised the price of the company s debut sports car to survive.Tesla went public in 2010 but for years it remained in crisis mode.
With production behind schedule and the company at risk of running out of money Musk spent much of April 2018 sleeping on the factory floor as he tried to iron out assembly line issues.
He would wake up look at the monitors on the wall and go chase the constraint says Musk s adviser Omead Afshar who slept on a cot.
He would be in there reviewing the system redoing the code himself solving problems bouncing from station to station.
He will endure the most pain to lead by example and all of us around him really can t complain when we re not working that hard.
For Musk s 47th birthday that June he briefly paused for a bite of grocery store cake then went back to the paint shop tunnel.The body of a Tesla Model 3 at the company s Fremont Calif. factoryJUSTIN KANEPS The New York Times ReduxThe cars finally rolled off the line but soon enough Musk shot himself in the foot.
In August 2018 he tweeted that he had funding to take the company private for 420 a share.
The Securities and Exchange Commission sued him alleging he had committed securities fraud.
The resulting settlement cost him his perch as Tesla s board chair though he was able to retain the title of CEO.
The adult supervision extends only to a point.
Three months later Tesla sent a software update that enabled the car to make farting noises on command.
Please put invented car fart on my gravestone Musk tweeted.
But for all the immaturity his public profile has an upside as well.
We don t spend any money on advertising notes Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm.
His ability to communicate with a very wide range of people globally through social media I think has been a huge asset to the company you know by and large.
His longtime friend Bill Lee who finds his memes and trolling charming says he was the one who persuaded Musk to join Twitter.
I remember when he had zero followers Lee recalls.
He s probably the most viral social influencer ever.
Today thanks in large part to Musk s pace setting auto companies from VW to Nissan are jostling to invest billions in electric vehicles.
Their about face is driven less by altruism than by a dawning realization that Musk is eating their lunch.
Musk and Tesla forced the change says Michelle Krebs an analyst at Cox Automotive.
He proved that there was a market for EVs.
That has made Musk arguably the biggest private contributor to the fight against climate change.
Had the 800 000 Teslas sold in the last year been gas powered cars they would have emitted more than 40 million metric tons of CO over their lifetimes equivalent to the annual emissions of Finland.
But EVs may ultimately be less important to the climate fight than the central innovation that made them possible batteries.
Tesla has repurposed the lightweight energy dense cells that power its cars for huge grid scale batteries that provide essential backup for renewables.
Demand for Tesla s smaller home based Powerwall which can store electricity from rooftop solar systems has spiked as consumers look for alternatives to the grid driven by everything fromFebruary s Texas power shortageto the fire risk in California that has led to power shutoffs.
In some areas software enables utilities to tap into home energy reserves when the grid is strained instead of turning on high polluting standby generators.
Gerry Hawkes a 72 year old forester from Woodstock Vt. has been participating in one such program since 2017 allowing his local utility to draw power from a pair of Tesla backup batteries in his basement.
It makes sense for power backup and it makes sense for climate change Hawkes says.A die casting tool for the Model Y at a Tesla factory in GermanyPatrick Pleul Getty ImagesSome of Musk s initiatives have generated more controversy.
His effort to produce and sell solar roof tiles has stumbled.
The Boring Co. which Musk started in 2016 put forward a plan to alleviate urban congestion by building miles of underground tunnels to whisk cars along at more than 100 m.p.h.
but critics say plain old subways would be more efficient and equitable.
Musk s move to accept Bitcoin as payment for Teslas this spring prompted accusations of hypocrisy the cryptocurrency s computational mining operations are a climate disaster drawing gargantuan amounts of electricity to process transactions.
Musk subsequently shelved the plan.Musk s January announcement of a 100 million climate prize rankled some environmentalists because of its inclusion of proposals for direct air carbon capture giant machines to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
While some experts say researching that technology is necessary others see it as a costly distraction.
Direct air capture is a boondoggle says Mark Jacobson director of Stanford s Atmosphere Energy program.
We can t waste our time and money on things that just don t work very well.
Tesla s hard charging approach has also raised concerns.
In May 2020 Musk reopened his Fremont Calif. factory against local public health orders.
It makes you wonder if your life is worth 20 an hour an anonymous Tesla worker toldSF Weekly.Musk says the regulators were wrong.
In March theNational Labor Relations Board ruledthat a 2018 Musk tweet had broken labor laws as did the company s firing of a union activist.
Tesla is appealing the ruling.This summer the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened a probe into Tesla s Autopilot system which has been involved in 11 crashes with parked emergency vehicles since 2018 leaving 17 people injured and one dead.
Musk has been accused of overstating and misrepresenting the system s abilities starting with the name despite the promises of an imminent driverless future Tesla drivers still have to keep their hands on the wheel.
We still obviously have a lot of work to do Musk says of truly autonomous vehicles though he insists the current software is safe.
Tesla s newest autonomous beta software has already been blamed for at least one crash since its broad release in September and videos showing the cars making dangerous errors have circulated online.
A former high level employee in Tesla s autonomous development program tells TIME that the new system s name Full Self Driving is irresponsible.In 2018 the Chinese government repealed a law against foreign ownership to allow Musk to build a factory in Shanghai.
Now Tesla appears to make about half of its cars in China but it risks losing its hold on the world s largest car market as the one party state turns to favor homegrown rivals like NIO and BYD.
Musk has faced criticism for pandering to America s increasingly assertive authoritarian rival.
Overall Tesla has a good relationship with China Musk told a business conference on Dec. 6.
I don t mean to endorse everything China does.
Despite supply chain shortages Tesla delivered 241 300 vehicles in the most recent quarter a record for the carmaker.
Ford and GM s combined market cap is less than a fifth of Tesla s even though they together sold three and a half times as many vehicles.
The Tesla Model 3 became the best selling vehicle in Europe in September and the company is swamped by new orders.
With demand soaring Musk is expanding production preparing to double its output with new factories in Germany and Texas.Tesla s gains have inspired investors to pour billions of dollars into EV startups like Rivian and Fisker.
One rival Lucid Motors is run by a former Tesla engineer who helped create the Model S. The Lucid Air sedan was recently named theMotorTrendCar of the Year.
Ford and GM have pumped money into thwarting Tesla s expansion into pickup trucks the most profitable segment of the domestic market.
But Musk says he isn t worried about being out competed.
If somebody makes better cars than we do and they then sell more cars than we do I think that s totally fine he says.
Our intent with Tesla was always that we would serve as an example to the car industry and hope that they also make electric cars so that we can accelerate the transition to sustainable technology.
Musk s mother was a model and his father was a monster.
Born in Pretoria in 1971 Elon was prone to long silences and speed reading the encyclopedia.
When he was 12 he wrote the code for a video game calledBlastar which he sold to a computer magazine for 500.
He was always different.
He was my little genius boy his mother Maye Musk tells TIME.
From the time he was 3 we used to call him that Genius Boy.
His parents divorced when Musk was 8.
After the divorce Elon and brother Kimbal went to live with their father.
Errol Musk was a brilliant engineer and entrepreneur he was also in Elon s telling an evil man who tormented the boy psychologically in ways Musk still finds painful to discuss.
Errol Musk toldRolling Stonehe once shot and killed three armed robbers who broke into his home.
In 2017 Errol later acknowledged he fathered a child with his ex stepdaughter 42 years his junior.
Musk has said he no longer has contact with his father.Musk age 24 at his computer in 1995 that year he co founded his first company Zip2 an online city guide that was a precursor to MapQuest and YelpCourtesy Maye MuskFrom left Musk middle at age 4 with his mother Maye brother Kimbal and sister Tosca Maye a model began calling Elon her genius boy when he was 3 years old Musk was born to a wealthy family in 1971.

Vicious gangs of bullies targeted Musk relentlessly at one point beating him so badly he was hospitalized until he hit a growth spurt in high school and started punching back.
Musk s maternal grandfather had moved from Canada to South Africa in 1950 arriving during the early years of apartheid.
When Musk was 17 he made the opposite journey in part to avoid the regime s military draft.
He took off for Canada enrolling at Queen s University in Ontario.Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania from which he graduated with a double major in physics and economics.
Accepted to Stanford University s Ph.D. program he moved to California but dropped out after two days.
Instead Elon and Kimbal decided to get in on the nascent Internet boom.
They rented a tiny office in Palo Alto slept on the floor showered at the YMCA pirated an Internet line from a neighbor and lived on Jack in the Box.
While Kimbal tried to drum up business Elon wrote code nonstop.Their first company Zip2 was the first Internet mapping service using GPS data to help consumers find businesses in their neighborhood a precursor to MapQuest.
In 1999 Compaq bought the company and Musk netted 22 million for his share.
For his next act Musk decided to reimagine the global banking system.
His company X.com eventually became part of PayPal which was purchased by eBay in 2002.
Musk came away with about 180 million.
But instead of gloating over his payday Musk still seems irked that these early companies never fulfilled their potential as he saw it.
If PayPal had just executed the product plan I wrote in July 2000 he told a podcast last year it could have put the entire banking industry out of business.At 30 Musk was fabulously rich but whiling away his days on a yacht didn t appeal to him.
After a severe bout of malaria nearly killed him in 2001 those close to him say he seemed to feel an urgency to make more of his time on Earth.
Around then he was shocked to discover that NASA had no plans to go to Mars.
Zubrin of the Mars Society introduced Musk to the community of serious space people even though he was skeptical of the latest in a parade of rich man boys with astro fetishes.
A globetrotting engineer named Jim Cantrell lent Musk his college rocketry textbooks which Musk devoured and agreed to take him to Russia where Musk hoped to buy an old Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile and turn it into a rocket launcher.
He did not come across as credible Cantrell recalls.
It was Who is this charlatan This guy s crazy he s not going to make a rocket.
After a couple of trips Musk concluded that the Russians were trying to rip him off and that their rockets weren t even very good.
He packed up and flew home from Moscow with Cantrell and Mike Griffin who would go on to serve as NASA administrator under President George W. Bush and undersecretary of defense under President Donald Trump.
Griffin and I are back in coach drinking whiskey and Mike says What do you think the idiot savant s doing up there loud enough for everyone to hear Cantrell recalls.
Elon s sitting in the row ahead of us.
And he turns around and says Hey guys I think we can build this rocket ourselves.
I ve got a spreadsheet.
We start looking at the spreadsheet like Elon where did you get this I still use something similar to model a rocket today.
He d just gone and figured it out.
Around the same time Musk met a Stanford trained engineer named JB Straubel who was trying to turn old Porsches into electric cars.
Energy storage had always been the biggest stumbling block a conventional battery would have to be so big and heavy that the car would expend most of its power hauling its own weight around.
Straubel believed recent advances in lithium ion batteries would enable much denser lighter power cells if only someone would give him the money to prove it.
Most investors he met dismissed him as a crazy gadfly.
Musk did the math and concluded on the spot that Straubel was right.
A few months later Musk pledged 6.5 million to a lithium ion car startup called Tesla becoming its largest investor and eventually taking it over.
I saw plenty of examples of people that had enormous wealth and were entirely cautious Straubel says.
In Elon there was this complete opposite mindset.
Musk had made the incredibly risky decision to plow his fortune into simultaneous startups in industries with high costs long development timelines and massive barriers to entry.
The last successful startup in the American automotive industry Chrysler was founded in 1925.
I said Just choose one solar or cars or rockets Maye Musk recalls.
Obviously he didn t listen.
By 2008 the scale of the challenge became clear.
Tesla had taken deposits of up to 60 000 from over 1 000 EV enthusiasts but had yet to deliver more than a few sample vehicles.
An automotive blog was running a regular Tesla Death Watch feature.
SpaceX had attempted to launch three single engine Falcon rockets from a remote atoll in the Pacific and all had exploded.
Then the financial crisis hit.
The world imploded.
GM and Chrysler went bankrupt.
We did not want Tesla to go bankrupt Kimbal Musk recalls.
I remember him calling me in October and asking me if I had any money.
I had no money everything was gone except for about 1 million I was saving to survive the recession.
I wired it to him to put into Tesla.
I told him If everything goes to hell at least we ll be in hell together.
Musk scraped together 8 million of his own money to cover payroll one week.Then finally the fourth rocket made a successful launch.
And two days before Christmas NASA made the shocking decision to award SpaceX 1.6 billion for 12 flights to the ISS.
I do sometimes wonder if other people have easier times building businesses because all our businesses have been really freaking hard Kimbal Musk says.
Something about our upbringing makes us constantly want to be on the edge.
Musk has been known to discuss his emotions as frankly and analytically as he does thrust to payload ratios but he can be remarkably vulnerable in public.
If I m not in love if I m not with a long term companion I cannot be happy he once confessed.
He has cried in several interviews and announced onSaturday Night Livethat he has Asperger s an autism spectrum disorder.
Musk uttered this intimate disclosure so awkwardly that many viewers took it as a joke.His first marriage was to his college sweetheart Justine Miller a writer.
I m the alpha in this relationship he told her as the newlyweds danced at their wedding according to a2010 essay she wrote inMarie Claire.Tragedy struck two years later when their 10 week old son Nevada stopped breathing in his crib.
Distraught the couple began in vitro fertilization treatments and Justine gave birth to twins and triplets all of whom are boys.
As Justine later told it Elon abandoned her to tend to his companies as she spiraled into depression inside an L.A. mansion that became a gilded cage.
Elon filed for divorce in the spring of 2008 and six weeks later announced his engagement to the British actor Talulah Riley.
He and Riley were married then divorced then remarried then divorced again in 2016.In 2018 Musk began dating the musician Claire Boucher whose stage name is Grimes.
Their son X was born in May 2020.
This September the couple announced their relationship had ended.
Grimes recently released a new song Player of Games Sail away to the cold expanse of space she sings.
Even love couldn t keep you in your place But can t you love me like that Musk explains the split as a matter of logistics.
Grimes and I are I d say probably semi separated Musk tells TIME in Texas.
We weren t seeing each other that much and I think this is to some degree a long term thing because what she needs to do is mostly in L.A. or touring and my work is mostly in remote locations like this.
He says they are still good friends and he does not have a new girlfriend.
This place is basically like a technology monastery you know.
There are some women here but not many.
And it s remote.
He would be happier with a partner says Kimbal.
But he s also a very hard person to be partnered with.
Family and friends say Musk is sensitive and can take slights personally particularly attacks on his wealth and media reports he views as unfair.
Having pledged on Twitter this year that he would no longer own a residence Musk has sold off his seven houses and considers his primary home a rental near the Starbase site in Boca Chica Texas.X is with his daddy today in Texas and a nanny brings the child to Musk between appointments.
The toddler has his father s porcelain skin and a mane of straw blond hair shaved on the sides into the same fauxhawk Musk recently adopted.
Musk takes him over to a patch of AstroTurf in front of the Starbase employee restaurant Astropub which has an awning made of rocket flaps.
X toddles for a few minutes while Musk watches arms crossed.
Then it s time to leave and Marvin departs with Musk while X goes with his nanny.In the future Musk envisions no one tells you what to do.
Robots perform all the labor and goods and services are abundant so people only work because they want to.
There s like plenty for everyone essentially he says.
There s not necessarily anyone who s the boss of you.
I don t mean to suggest chaos but rather that you re not under anyone s thumb.
So you have the freedom to do whatever you d like to do provided it does not cause harm to others.
Elon Musk at the SpaceX launch site in Boca Chica Texas December 3 2021.Photograph by Mark Mahaney for TIMEMusk has disavowed terrestrial political affiliations and maintained good relations with politicians of both parties including Presidents Obama and Trump though he quit the latter s business council after only a few months over the decision to pull out of the Paris climate accords.
Of President Joe Biden he says I don t think he s doing an amazing job but I don t know it s hard to tell.
He has an ardent following in some of the nastier precincts of the far right but Musk claims that when he tweeted Take the red pill last year he had no idea that red pilling was a right wing dog whistle I was just referring toThe Matrix the movie from which the meme derives.Unlike some techno libertarians Musk doesn t anticipate a grim future of competition for resources in which only the naturally gifted prevail.
But he rejects the idea that the size of his fortune constitutes a policy problem in and of itself or that he is morally obligated to pay some share of it in taxes.
Arecent ProPublica investigationfound that Musk and many others in his tax bracket paid no individual federal taxes as recently as 2018 because they had no income only assets.
In October Senate Democrats considered imposing a billionaires tax on wealth.
When Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon tweeted in support of it Musk responded with a vulgar insult of Wyden s appearance in his profile photo.A close up of a Starship at the SpaceX launch site in TexasMark Mahaney for TIMEWhen the topic of government comes up in TIME s interview Musk briefly amuses himself by humming rapper Warren G s 90s hip hop hit Regulate.
They re basically saying they want control of the assets he says.
This does not result in actually the good of the people.
You want those who are managing capital to be good stewards of capital.
And I think the government is inherently not a good steward of capital.
In an interview Wyden agreed with Musk s interpretation of his position at least in part the purpose of such a tax is to take assets out of private hands for public use.
Government he argues is inherently a more public spirited and accountable steward of resources than any individual and is empowered to ensure all of society benefits from the profits a dynamic economy generates.
In this country I think there is a consensus that we ought to pay for the priorities we really care about and everyone ought to pay their fair share Wyden says.James Pethokoukis an economic analyst with the conservative leaning American Enterprise Institute thinks Musk does have a coherent politics whether or not he articulates it.
The reason it s confusing is it s not on the traditional left right spectrum he says.
It is a politics of progress.
At a time when segments of the right and left alike champion protectionist populism from Republican Senator Josh Hawley s hostility to free trade to Bernie Sanders redistributionism this puts Musk at odds with both.
It is a view that says the solution to man s problems is growth and technological progress and maximizing human potential Pethokoukis says.
It s not a view fully represented by either side in this country.
Musk at an event for The Boring Company his high speed tunnel ventureJoshua Lott Getty ImagesMusk s belief in progress is not absolute.
He has been outspoken about confronting what he sees as the dangers of out of control artificial intelligence and cofounded the AI companies Neuralink and Open AI to advance that goal.
He finds cryptocurrency interesting and can talk endlessly about the conception of money as an information system for resource allocation.
But he doubts that crypto will replace fiat currency and disavows responsibility for the way his tweets have sent markets into a tizzy.
Markets move themselves all the time he says based on nothing as far as I can tell.
So the statements that I make are they materially different from random movements of the stock that might happen anyway I don t think so.
Zubrin of the Mars Society believes three qualities could fell Musk his workaholism his recklessness or a sort of earned hubris.
Great leaders become incapable of hearing criticism he says.
Why did Napoleon fail in Russia Because every time before he had succeeded.
Plenty of French generals were saying Why don t we just take Poland and be good But every time in the past the people who urged caution had been wrong.
Nevertheless Zubrin would not bet against his old friend.
Geniusis a word that is frequently associated with Musk wisdomis not he says wryly.
But there is one sense in which Musk in my view is very wise which is that he understands that he doesn t have forever.

It cost like 45 000 or something Musk said on theFull Send podcast which aired late Thursday.
It s very small.
The home is within walking distance of the facility where SpaceX is working on building a giant rocket Musk added.
He noted that he also has aBoxable tiny homein Boca Chica which he uses as a guest house for friends who come to visit.Musk who is worth an estimated 268 billion has long drawn attention for his unusual lifestyle such as a recent report that he hadtwins with one of his top executiveslast year or roughly around the time he had a second child with the musician Grimes.
Friends of mine come and they can t believe I m staying in this house Musk said in the podcast.
Asked if he likes staying there Musk responded If I m there by myself it s fine.
The home was originally a two bedroom property but Musk said he converted the garage into a third bedroom.
He added that he s trying to change the name of the street from Weems Street to Meme Street.Twitter reports low earnings amid Elon Musk deal fallout03 44That 45 000 price tag is extremely low for a U.S. home with the median listing price reaching 450 000 in June according to Realtor.com.
Musk didn t mention when the house was bought which could have occurred prior to the run up in home prices during the pandemic.One property currently for sale on Weems Street a 1 000 square foot home listed as a fixer upper for SpaceX enthusiasts islistedfor 375 000.Musk hasn t always lived in a modest home.
The billionaire reportedly held a real estate portfolio worth 100 million at one point although in 2020 he declared on Twitter that he was selling his properties and vowed to own no house.
In December it was reported Musk was actually living in an Austin mansion owned by Ken Howery according to theWall Street Journal.
Howery who co founded PayPal along with Musk and others bought the 8 000 square foot home in 2018 for 12 million when it was the most expensive property in Austin according to Forbes.Trending NewsWalmart sues Capital One to end credit card partnership earlyWhole Foods closes San Francisco store for staff safety M tley Cr e guitarist sues group claiming he was axed for illnessTaxes 2023 Here s how to get a tax extension from the IRSTupperware stock plunges after warning it may go out of businessIn Elon MuskFirst published on August 5 2022 11 33 AM 2022 CBS Interactive Inc.

Remote work is no longer allowed unless you have a specific exception.
Managers will send the exception lists to me for review and approval Musk wrote.He added that the new policy first reported by Bloomberg would be effective from Thursday for a minimum of 40 hours a week.The news comes as the company continues to shed staff.
Musk fired about half of the company s 7 500 strong workforce last Friday having bought it for 44bn 38.7bn the previous week and the chief information security officer Lea Kissner confirmed on Thursday she had left Twitter in the latest high profile departure.Musk said Twitter had been hit by a pause in spending from advertisers that had caused a massive drop in revenue .
Twitter makes most of its more than 5bn in annual revenue from advertising.The company has begun rolling outTwitterBlue its new subscription service in the UK.
Users who pay 6.99 a month get a blue tick next to their username as well as early access to forthcoming features such as bookmark folders and the ability to change the colour of the app icon.
Musk is hoping that Twitter Blue will reduce the company s reliance on advertising.Despite the chief executive s promise last week that the international pricing of Blue would be adjusted proportionate to purchasing power parity an economic measure of exchange rates that takes into account the cost of living in various countries Musk seems to have given ground to Apple.
The subscription service is billed through Apple s in app purchases which locked Twitter into charging 6.99 in the UK to match the 7.99 in the US.Musk tried to reassure advertisers about his plans for the company in a meeting on Twitter s audio chat feature Spaces on Wednesday.Big brands including General Motors United Airlines the cereal maker General Mills and othershave paused buying ads on Twitteras they watch whether Musk s past comments that he is a free speech absolutist will lead to a rise in hate speech and divisive content on the platform.Brands on Wednesday s call included Deutsche Bank Chevron Nissan Air Canada and Audi which has paused Twitter ads.
The American outdoor equipment retailer REI also attended and said after the call that its ads were still paused according to Associated Press.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day we ll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningPrivacy Notice Newsletters may contain info about charities online ads and content funded by outside parties.

He said it would be advisory and not a command council .The mass layoffs have raised concern about the company s ability to maintain security on the platform and comply with government regulations.
Those fears were compounded this week by the departure of three top security officials at the company includingKissner the chief privacy officer Damien Kieran and the chief compliance officer Marianne Fogarty.In their absence employees are being encouraged to self certify the platform is running in compliance with privacy laws according to a reportfrom the Verge on Thursday.
Breaking these laws could result in billions of dollars in fines.
This comes after Twitter reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in May over privacy issues under which it is required to perform privacy reviews before making changes to its products.
The report suggested Musk had already bypassed its standard data governance processes relating to changes and an internal lawyer told workers to seek whistleblower protection if you feel uncomfortable about anything you re being asked to do according to the Verge.Kari Paul contributed reportingTopicsTwitterWorking from homeElon MuskTechnology sectornewsReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyMusk admits BBC among least biased in row over Twitter government funded media tag2d agoTwitter makes unexplained logo change to Dogecoin cryptocurrency image4 Apr 2023Row between Twitter and Substack ends with uneasy truce13h agoTwitter to no longer only promote paid for accounts after backlash29 Mar 2023Twitter to promote only paying users tweets Elon Musk announces28 Mar 2023Twitter takes legal action after source code leaked online27 Mar 2023Elon Musk memo suggests Twitter worth less than half of what he paid for it26 Mar 2023Rise in Twitter outages since Musk takeover hints at more systemic problems8 Mar 2023Twitter down for more than an hour around world1 Mar 2023Elon Musk fires additional 200 people at Twitter report says27 Feb 2023Most viewedMost viewedUSWorldEnvironmentSoccerUS PoliticsBusinessTechScienceNewslettersFight to voteNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top 2023Guardian News Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

In this excerpt from his latest book Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future Ecco Ashlee Vance chronicles the engineer and entrepreneur s global jump.Musk s great escape to Canada was not well thought out.He knew of a great uncle in Montreal hopped on a flight and hoped for the best.
Upon landing in June 1988 Musk found a pay phone and tried to use directory assistance to find his uncle.
When that didn t work he called his mother collect.
She had bad news.
Maye had sent a letter to the uncle before Musk left and received a reply while her son was in transit.
The uncle had gone to Minnesota meaning Musk had nowhere to stay.
Bags in hand Musk headed for a youth hostel.After spending a few days in Montreal exploring the city Musk tried to come up with a long term plan.
Maye had family scattered all across Canada and Musk began reaching out to them.
He bought a countrywide bus ticket that let him hop on and off as he pleased for one hundred dollars and opted to head to Saskatchewan the former home of his grandfather.
After a 1 900 mile bus ride he ended up in Swift Current a town of fifteen thousand people.
Musk called a second cousin out of the blue from the bus station and hitched a ride to his house.Musk spent the next year working a series of odd jobs around Canada.
He tended vegetables and shoveled out grain bins at a cousin s farm located in the tiny town of Waldeck.
Musk celebrated his eighteenth birthday there sharing a cake with the family he d just met and a few strangers from the neighborhood.
After that he learned to cut logs with a chain saw in Vancouver British Columbia.
The hardest job Musk took came after a visit to the unemployment office.
He inquired about the job with the best wage which turned out to be a gig cleaning the boiler room of a lumber mill for eighteen dollars an hour.
You have to put on this hazmat suit and then shimmy through this little tunnel that you can barely fit in Musk said.
Then you have a shovel and you take the sand and goop and other residue which is still steaming hot and you have to shovel it through the same hole you came through.
There is no escape.
Someone else on the other side has to shovel it into a wheelbarrow.
If you stay in there for more than thirty minutes you get too hot and die.
Thirty people started out at the beginning of the week.
By the third day five people were left.
At the end of the week it was just Musk and two other men doing the work.As Musk made his way around Canada his brother sister and mother were figuring out how to get there as well.
When Kimbal Musk and Elon eventually reunited in Canada their headstrong playful natures bloomed.
Elon ended up enrolling at Queen s University in Kingston Ontario in 1989.
He picked Queen s over the University of Waterloo because he felt there were more good looking women at Queen s. Outside of his studies Elon would read the newspaper alongside Kimbal and the two of them would identify interesting people they would like to meet.
They then took turns cold calling these people to ask if they were available to have lunch.
Among the harassed was the head of marketing for the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team a business writer for the Globe and Mail and a top executive at the Bank of Nova Scotia Peter Nicholson.
Nicholson remembered the boys call well.
I was not in the habit of getting out of the blue requests he said.
I was perfectly prepared to have lunch with a couple of kids that had that kind of gumption.
It took six months to get on Nicholson s calendar but sure enough the Musk brothers made a threehour train ride and showed up on time.
The second sentence out of his mouth was I think a lot about electric cars.
Nicholson s first exposure to the Musk brothers left him with an impression many would share.
Both presented themselves well and were polite.
Elon though clearly came off as the geekier more awkward counterpoint to the charismatic personable Kimbal.
I became more impressed and fascinated as I talked to them Nicholson said.
They were so determined.
Nicholson ended up offering Elon a summer internship at the bank and became his trusted advisor.Not long after their initial meeting Elon invited Peter Nicholson s daughter Christie to his birthday party.
Christie showed up at Maye s Toronto apartment with a jar of homemade lemon curd in hand and was greeted by Elon and about fifteen other people.
Elon had never met Christie before but he went right up to her and led her to a couch.
Then I believe the second sentence out of his mouth was I think a lot about electric cars Christie said.
And then he turned to me and said Do you think about electric cars The conversation left Christie who is now a science writer with the distinct impression that Musk was handsome affable and a tremendous nerd.
For whatever reason I was so struck by that moment on the sofa she said.
You could tell that this person was very different.
He captivated me in that way.
With her angular features and blond hair Christie fit Musk s type and the two stayed in touch during Musk s time in Canada.
They never really dated but Christie found Musk interesting enough to have lengthy conversations with him on the phone.
One night he told me If there was a way that I could not eat so I could work more I would not eat.
I wish there was a way to get nutrients without sitting down for a meal.
The enormity of his work ethic at that age and his intensity jumped out.
It seemed like one of the more unusual things I had ever heard.
Media Platforms Design TeamCollege suited Musk.He worked on being less of a know it all while also finding a group of people who respected his intellectual abilities.
The university students were less inclined to laugh off or deride his opinionated takes on energy space and whatever else was captivating him at the moment.
Musk had found people who responded to his ambition rather than mocking it and he fed on this environment.Navaid Farooq a Canadian who grew up in Geneva ended up in Musk s freshman year dormitory in the fall of 1990.
Both men were placed in the international section where a Canadian student would get paired with a student from overseas.
Musk sort of broke the system since he technically counted as a Canadian but knew almost nothing about his surroundings.
I had a roommate from Hong Kong and he was a really nice guy Musk said.
He religiously attended every lecture which was helpful since I went to the least number of classes possible.
For a time Musk sold computer parts and full PCs in the dorm to make some extra cash.
I could build something to suit their needs like a tricked out gaming machine or a simple word processor that cost less than what they could get in a store Musk said.
Or if their computer didn t boot properly or had a virus I d fix it.
I could pretty much solve any problem.
Farooq and Musk bonded over their backgrounds living abroad and a shared interest in strategy board games.
I don t think he makes friends easily but he is very loyal to those he has Farooq said.
When the video game Civilization was released the college chums spent hours building their empire much to the dismay of Farooq s girlfriend who was forgotten in another room.
Elon could lose himself for hours on end Farooq said.
The students also relished their loner lifestyles.
We are the kinds of people that can be by ourselves at a party and not feel awkward Farooq said.
We can think to ourselves and not feel socially weird about it.
Musk was more ambitious in college than he d been in high school.
He studied business competed in public speaking contests and began to display the brand of intensity and competitiveness that marks his behavior today.
After one economics exam Musk Farooq and some other students in class came back to the dorms and began comparing notes to try to ascertain how well they did on the test.
It soon became clear that Musk had a firmer grasp on the material than anyone else.
This was a group of fairly high achievers and Elon stood way outside of the bell curve Farooq said.
Musk s intensity has continued to be a constant in their long relationship.
When Elon gets into something he develops just this different level of interest in it than other people.
That is what differentiates Elon from the rest of humanity.
In 1992 having spent two years at Queen s Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania on a scholarship.
Musk saw the Ivy League school as possibly opening some additional doors and went off in pursuit of dual degrees first an economics degree from the Wharton School and then a bachelor s degree in physics.
Justine stayed at Queen s pursuing her dream of becoming a writer and maintained a long distance relationship with Musk.
Now and again she would visit him and the two would sometimes head off to New York for a romantic weekend.
It was a full out unlicensed speakeasy Musk blossomed even more at Penn and really started to feel comfortable while hanging out with his fellow physics students.
At Penn he met people that thought like him Maye said.
There were some nerds there.
He so enjoyed them.
I remember going for lunch with them and they were talking physics things.
They were saying A plus B equals pi squared or whatever.
They would laugh out loud.
It was cool to see him so happy.
Once again however Musk did not make many friends among the broader school body.
It s difficult to find former students who remember him being there at all.
But he did make one very close friend named Adeo Ressi who would go on to be a Silicon Valley entrepreneur in his own right and is to this day as tight with Elon as anyone.Ressi is a lanky guy well over six feet tall and possesses an eccentric air.
He was the artistic colorful foil to the studious more buttoned up Musk.
Both of the young men were transfer students and ended up being placed in the funky freshman dorm.
The lackluster social scene did not live up to Ressi s expectations and he talked Musk into renting a large house off campus.
They got the ten bedroom home relatively cheap since it was a frat house that had gone unrented.
During the week Musk and Ressi would study but as the weekend approached Ressi in particular would transform the house into a nightclub.
He covered the windows with trash bags to make it pitch black inside and decorated the walls with bright paints and whatever objects he could find.
It was a full out unlicensed speakeasy Ressi said.
We would have as many as five hundred people.
We would charge five dollars and it would be pretty much all you could drink beer and Jell O shots and other things.
Come Friday night the ground around the house would shake from the intensity of the bass being pumped out by Ressi s speakers.
Maye visited one of the parties and discovered that Ressi had hammered objects into the walls and lacquered them with glowin the dark paint.
She ended up working the door as the coat check money taker and grabbed a pair of scissors for protection as the cash piled up in a shoe box.A second house had fourteen rooms.
Musk Ressi and one other person lived there.
They fashioned tables by laying plywood on top of used kegs and came up with other makeshift furniture ideas.
Musk returned home one day to find that Ressi had nailed his desk to the wall and then painted it in Day Glo colors.
Musk retaliated by pulling his desk down painting it black and studying.
I m like Dude that s installation art in our party house said Ressi.
Remind Musk of this incident and he ll respond matter of factly It was a desk.
Musk will have the occasional vodka and Diet Coke but he s not a big drinker and does not really care for the taste of alcohol.
Somebody had to stay sober during these parties Musk said.
I was paying my own way through college and could make an entire month s rent in one night.
Adeo was in charge of doing cool shit around the house and I would run the party.
As Ressi put it Elon was the most straight laced dude you have ever met.
He never drank.
He never did anything.
Zero.
Literally nothing.
The only time Ressi had to step in and moderate Musk s behavior came during video game binges that could go on for days.Musk s longtime interest in solar power and in finding other new ways to harness energy expanded at Penn.In December 1994 he had to come up with a business plan for one of his classes and ended up writing a paper titled The Importance of Being Solar.
The document started with a bit of Musk s wry sense of humor.
At the top of the page he wrote The sun will come out tomorrow. . . . Little Orphan Annie on the subject of renewable energy.
The paper went on to predict a rise in solar power technology based on materials improvements and the construction of large scale solar plants.
Musk delved deeply into how solar cells work and the various compounds that can make them more efficient.
He concluded the paper with a drawing of the power station of the future.
It depicted a pair of giant solar arrays in space each four kilometers in width sending their juice down to Earth via microwave beams to a receiving antenna with a seven kilometer diameter.
Musk received a 98 on what his professor deemed a very interesting and well written paper.
A second paper talked about taking research documents and books and electronically scanning them performing optical character recognition and putting all of the information in a single database much like a mix between today s Google Books and Google Scholar.
And a third paper dwelled on another of Musk s favorite topics ultracapacitors.
In the forty four page document Musk is plainly jubilant over the idea of a new form of energy storage that would suit his future pursuits with cars planes and rockets.
Pointing to the latest research coming out of a lab in Silicon Valley he wrote The end result represents the first new means of storing significant amounts of electrical energy since the development of the battery and fuel cell.
Furthermore because the Ultracapacitor retains the basic properties of a capacitor it can deliver its energy over one hundred times faster than a battery of equivalent weight and be recharged just as quickly.
Musk received a 97 for this effort and praise for a very thorough analysis with excellent financials I told... my ex wife about these ideas.
It probably sounded like super crazy talk.
The remarks from the professor were spot on.
Musk s clear concise writing is the work of a logician moving from one point to the next with precision.
What truly stood out though was Musk s ability to master difficult physics concepts in the midst of actual business plans.
Even then he showed an unusual knack for being able to perceive a path from a scientific advance to a for profit enterprise.As Musk began to think more seriously about what he would do after college he briefly considered getting into the videogame business.
He d been obsessed with video games since his childhood and had held a gaming internship.
But he came to see them as not quite grand enough a pursuit.
I really like computer games but then if I made really great computer games how much effect would that have on the world he said.
It wouldn t have a big effect.
Even though I have an intrinsic love of video games I couldn t bring myself to do that as a career.
In interviews Musk often makes sure that people know he had some truly big ideas on his mind during this period of his life.
As he tells it he would daydream at Queen s and Penn and usually end up with the same conclusion he viewed the Internet renewable energy and space as the three areas that would undergo significant change in the years to come and as the markets where he could make a big impact.
He vowed to pursue projects in all three.
I told all my ex girlfriends and my ex wife about these ideas he said.
Musk s insistence on explaining the early origins of his passion for electric cars solar energy and rockets can come off as insecure.
It feels as if Musk is trying to shape his life story in a forced way.
But for Musk the distinction between stumbling into something and having intent is important.
Musk has long wanted the world to know that he s different from the run of the mill entrepreneur in Silicon Valley.
He wasn t just sniffing out trends and he wasn t consumed by the idea of getting rich.
He s been in pursuit of a master plan all along.
I really was thinking about this stuff in college he said.
It is not some invented story after the fact.
I don t want to seem like a Johnny come lately or that I m chasing a fad or just being opportunistic.
I m not an investor.
I like to make technologies real that I think are important for the future and useful in some sort of way.

expletive Yeah Team America World PoliceCon Te Partiro Andrea BocelliSanta Claus is Coming to TownTranscriptRaul Campos Hey I m Raul Campos from KCRW and I m here with entrepreneur Elon Musk best known for co founding PayPal as well as CEO of both SpaceX and Tesla Motors.
Today we are here to talk about songs that have inspired him over the years as part of KCRW s Guest DJ Project.
Elon thank you for inviting us here to SpaceX.
This is really really cool.Elon Musk Absolutely.
Thanks for having me on the show.RC Fly Me To The Moon EM Laughter That s the obvious one.RC Laughs The obvious one.
Explain a little bit why Frank Sinatra EM I like the sense of possibility and it s really inspiring.
Laughter RC Well I m sure that s going to happen pretty soon EM Yeah absolutely.
You hear this song and it sounds like it s really going to happen.RC Well lets check out Fly me to the Moon Frank Sinatra as selected by our guest DJ Elon Musk right here on KCRW.comSong Fly me to the Moon Frank SinatraRC You re known as the entrepreneur but what was the first thing you ever sold Or said wow you know what I have this knack for designing stuff and things that people like.
EM I kind of think of myself more as an engineer and a designer rather than as an entrepreneur.
In that the things that I m interested in are advanced technology and the things that are pushing to the forefront and I think the things that are perhaps likely to change the future of humanity in a positive way.
And I ve found out that I needed to run the company in order to design and engineer the things that are important or that I think of as important otherwise somebody else makes me do a different thing.I guess that the first thing that I sold when I was a kid was I wrote this computer game called Blastar.
It was sort of a space war game that I thought was cool because I thought that Wow.
I got paid money to make a game.
That s great.
Laughter RC How old were you EM Maybe about 12 or so.RC Wow That s crazy What s the next one we are going to check out EM It s Always Look on the Bright side of life.
And my personal philosophy is I d rather be optimistic and wrong rather than pessimistic and right.Song Always Look on the Bright Side of Life Monty PythonRC Now you are originally from South Africa.
What was your first introduction to the Monty Python EM I saw ir first when I was pretty young probably about 8 or 9 or something and I didn t quite get it.
Laughter RC So Elon talk about this wheel of cheese that went up into space.EM You know I m a big believer in not getting too corporate and losing any sort of sense of humor.
When we did the first test flight of our Dragon spacecraft we were thinking of what sort of interesting and wacky things we can put on there and I really liked the cheese shop sketch from Monty Python.
So it was like lets put a big wheel of cheese on the spacecraft.
So we got the biggest wheel of cheese the Beverly Hills Cheese Shop had a giant wheel of stinky Gruyere.
And we kept it secret because if something had gone wrong with the flight then people would have thought that perhaps we ve been distracted by the cheese or something.
We don t ever really want to be a boring corporate situation.
It d better to have a sense of humor and don t get too wrapped up in yourself.RC So let s get into the tune from Monty Python s Life of Brian Always Look on the Bright Side of Life .
Our guest DJ is Elon Musk and we re hanging out here at SpaceX.So that was Always look on the bright side of life from Monty Python s Life of Brian.
Our guest DJ is Mr. Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla.
What s this next tune that you have for us here EM This is America Blank Yeah Laughter RC And we should say that the blank starts with an F Laughs Song America.
expletive Yeah Team America World Police ThemeEM Laughs Yeah right.That is from the movie Team America .
I m a big fan of South Park.
The shows that I watch South Park Daily Show and Colbert Report those are sort of my main three ones they just capture a little bit of essence of America in both a good and a bad way.RC You can say that a little bit.
Laughter EM I think it s funny and inspiring in a weird way a song that just kind of gets you fired up.
Laughs It s just cool.
I like it.RC So let s get into it.
America F Yeah from Team America.
Our guest DJ is Elon Musk.
Known for PayPal SpaceX and the infamous arcade game Blastar RC This is KCRW.com.
Raul Campos here with Elon Musk and we are just picking tunes and we just heard America F Yeah and now were are going to kind of flip the script and go to something quite on the opposite end of the spectrum.
It s Andrea Bocelli.EM Right.
I think Con Te Partiro is an incredibly beautiful song.Song Con Te Partiro Andrea BocelliEM It s really calming.
And it s just a really beautiful song.
And obviously Andrea Bocelli is just an incredible singer.RC Well when you need to be in that kind of relaxed mode or to put you in a mellow environment is this something that you go to EM Yeah it is actually.
I think that song is kind of a reminder that the world is a beautiful place.
It s an incredibly beautiful song sung really beautifully so I think that s why it makes me feel that way about the world.RC Alright.
So let s get into this Italian superstar Andrea Bocelli Con Te Partiro right here on KCRW.com.Our guest DJ is Elon Musk picking tunes that have inspired him over the years.
Well I ll let you explain the next one we re playing.
What s this one we are going to get into EM Santa Claus is Coming to Town.
I personally don t understand it but it s the song that I whistle the most.
Laughter Song Santa Claus is Coming to Town RC You came here in the late 80s.. Did you come with a vision or with a hope of finding something in The States or in Canada EM Well when I was growing up I read a lot of books and bought a lot of comics and things and it just seemed like interesting things happen in America.
And particularly with the perspective to cutting edge technology it seemed to happen in America almost all of the time and I was really interested in being involved in the cutting edge of technology.
That s what got me excited and I knew I wanted to come to America.
In college I was able to transfer to U Penn.
I do think America is the greatest country in the world.
I don t think it s flawless obviously it s not perfect but it s the least imperfect country in the world.RC So that was Santa Claus is Coming to Town.
Of course So Elon I can t let you go without hearing a little bit of the whistling SpaceX is planning to send an unmanned capsule to the International Space Station next year.
How about some Fly Me to the Moon.
EM Whistles to the tune of Fly Me to the Moon.
Laughter RC That is awesome So that was such a wide variety.
Thank you so much for taking a little bit of time out.

The books Musk recommends range widely in subject matter and it s definitely worth noting the titles in his collection to get an inside look at how the leader got where he is today.
I was raised by books.
Books and then my parents Musk once said in an interview withRolling Stone.It s reported that he read the entirety of theEncyclopedia Britannicaby age 9 and would continue to be engrossed in books for more than 10 hours a day throughout his childhood.Musk s reading list is long but he s been outspoken about a handful of favorites from his reading list over the years as detailed in a video fromInc.com.
Whether or not we go on to read books about building rockets as Musk did in his studies there s also a lot that can be gained from checking out the full range of themes across the following 13 of Elon s favorite books.Above A few of Elon Musk s favorite books YouTube Inc.
Some of the most prominent subjects in Musk s reading list are engineering and structural design sometimes quite literally rocket science.
Below are a couple of the books Musk recommends dealing with these kinds of technical themes.
Structures Or Why Things Don t Fall Down J.E.
Gordon About this book Musk said It is really really good if you want a primer on structural design.
Ignition An Informal History of Liquid Rocket Propellants John D. Clark Blinkistalso shared a few of Musk s favorites noting his hyperfocus on artificial intelligence which can be seen in his broad tastes for science fiction.
Obviously AI plays a major role in Tesla s Autopilot and Full Self Driving beta systems and the potential for these systems to learn hangs in a delicate balance with some of the risks posed by its existence.
The Culture Iain M. Banks Musk says this science fiction series offers a compelling picture of a grand semi utopian galactic future that s hopefully not too optimistic about AI.
Our Final Invention James Barrat Another sci fi book about the dangers of AI Musk has echoed warnings from this book about how society today should keep an eye on the emerging technology.
Human Compatible Artificial Intelligence and the Problem of Control Stuart Russell Life 3.0 Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence Max Tegmark Superintelligence Paths Dangers Strategies Nick Bostrom Some of the books on Musk s reading list explore broader themes more closely such as philosophy culture business or consciousness in general.
These include those listed below.
Zero to One Notes on Startups or How to Build the Future Peter Thiel OnZero to One Musk said of his former counterpart at Paypal Peter Thiel has built multiple breakthrough companies and Zero to One shows how.
Steve Jobs Walter Isaacson Merchants of Doubt Naomi Oreskes Erik M. Conway The Big Picture Sean M. Carroll Lying Sam Harris The Wealth of Nations Adam Smith It probably goes without saying that the books a person reads can have a lot to do with the development of their thoughts and behavior.
In Musk s case it s easy to see how some of these titles topics and general fields of study have helped lead him to success from which we can hopefully all learn something.

Musk of course is the billionaire and brilliant mind behind Tesla and SpaceX.Charlie Mungerwas asked a question about him at the 2014 Daily Journal Meeting and he replied I think Elon Musk is a genius and I don t use that word lightly.
I think he s also one of the boldest men that ever came down the pike.In fact after meeting Musk people tend to walk away with the same reaction He s the smartest guy I ve ever met.
Whenever anyone asks him how he learned to build rockets he says I read books.
Not only does he read them according to hisinterview with Esquire he devours them.
Musk takes us into his personal library and offers some recommendations of his own.In an interview withDesign and Architecture Musk said In terms of sci fi books I think Isaac Asimov is really great.
I like theFoundation series probably one of the all time best.
Robert Heinlein obviously.
I likeThe Moon Is a Harsh Mistressand I likeStranger in a Strange Land although it kind of goes off the rails at the end.
He continues There s a good book on structural design calledStructures Or Why Things Don t Fall Down.
It is really really good if you want a primer on structural design.
Here are some of his other reading recommendations.The Lord of the Ringsby J.R.R.
Tolkien.
He toldthe New Yorkerthat as an undersized and picked upon smart aleck he turned to reading fantasy and science fiction.
The heroes of the books I read The Lord of the Rings and the Foundation series always felt a duty to save the world.
Benjamin Franklin An American Lifeby Walter Isaacson.
He was an entrepreneur Musk says inan interview.
He started from nothing.
He was just a runaway kid.
In that same interview he also recommendsEinstein His Life and Universe also by Isaacson.Zero to One Notes on Startups or How to Build the Futureby Peter Thiel I ve already said this is required reading for Farnam Streeters.
On this book Musk says Peter Thiel has built multiple breakthrough companies and this book shows how.
Superintelligence Paths Dangers Strategiesby Nick Bostrom.
Worth reading Superintelligence by Bostrom.
We need to be super careful with AI.
Potentially more dangerous than nukes.
Musk tweeted.
Of course I bought this.Howard Hughes His Life and Madnessby Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele.Recently inan interview with CNN he mentioned having just finished this book.
Musk calls it a cautionary tale.
The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxyby Douglas Adams.
Here is an excerpt froman interviewwhere he explains why this was a key book for him Alison van Diggelen I understand Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy that wonderful book by Douglas Adams that was a key book for you.
What was it about that book that fired your imagination Elon Musk I guess when I was around 12 or 15 I had an existential crisis and I was reading various books on trying to figure out the meaning of life and what does it all mean It all seemed quite meaningless and then we happened to have some books by Nietzsche and Schopenhauer in the house which you should not read at age 14 laughter .
It is bad it s really negative.
So then I read Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy which is quite positive I think and it highlighted an important point which is that a lot of times the question is harder than the answer.
And if you can properly phrase the question then the answer is the easy part.
So to the degree that we can better understand the universe then we can better know what questions to ask.
Then whatever the question is that most approximates what s the meaning of life That s the question we can ultimately get closer to understanding.
And so I thought to the degree that we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness and knowledge then that would be a good thing.
Finally we get to the rocket science part.Ignition An informal history of liquid rocket propellantsby John D. Clark.
There is a good book on rocket stuff called Ignition by John Clark that s a really fun one Musk said inan interview.
Becoming a rocket scientist isn t cheap.

While quite a hefty read of complex and difficult world building Duneexplores the central ideas of politics technology and environmentalism all of which Musk has a profound interest in.Even thoughDuneis a sci fi novel set in the future you won t find any supercomputers or artificial intelligence in its world.
The story explains that there was once an ideological war on artificial intelligence one side of the humans believed it was harmless to rely on superintelligence for natural aspects of life while the other side believed superintelligence would destroy humanity.Living up to his reputation of being a hard advocate against artificial intelligence Musk praised theDuneseries for touching on the subject.

Throughout his career he s recommended many books that will educate you on the harm of artificial intelligence.
In addition he offers other books on controversial subjects such as humanity s impact on global warming.Here are three of Elon Musk s favorite books on technology and science.Life 3.0InLife 3.0 Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence cosmologist Max Tegmark argues that artificial intelligence AI doesn t exactly mean the downfall of humans.
While emphasizing that it s definitely possible there are safe ways to ensure that humans and advanced technology can have a future together.

One of these questions is How ethical is artificial intelligence and are we in danger of it InOur Final Invention James Barrat sets out to answer this question.
Barrat includes both the benefits and risks of artificial intelligence that matches or exceeds human intelligence but remains a cautious tone about the technology throughout the book.Musk spoke on Twitter about his distaste for artificial intelligence and recommendedOur Final Inventionsaying While on the subject of AI risk Our Final Inventionby James Barrat is also worth reading.
Merchants of DoubtTITLE Merchants of DoubtAUTHOR Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. ConwayTIME 63READS 48.7IMG URL https www.shortform.com blog wp content uploads 2021 05 merchants of doubt cover.pngBOOK SUMMARYURL merchants of doubt summary naomi oreskes and erik m conwayAMZN ID XYZMerchants of doubt are people or organizationswho discredit science that threatens their agenda or ideology.
The first merchants of doubt were members of the tobacco industry when scientists discovered that smoking caused cancer which was bad for businesses.
It was also bad for capitalism in general because it suggested that the market wasn t self regulating and the lack of regulation was killing people.InMerchants of Doubt science historians Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway study the doubt mongering techniques used in several other important debates nuclear disarmament acid rain the ozone layer climate change and the pesticide DDT.
These techniques are still in use today.Musk agreeswith Conway and Oreskes s take on the global warming controversy being similar to earlier controversies about tobacco smoking Worth readingMerchants of Doubt.
Same who tried to deny smoking deaths are denying climate change.
Musk s Other Recommendations on TwitterGiven that he prefers science both real and imagined it s not surprising that those are the popular genres among Elon Musk s favorite book recommendations.
However he does occasionally tweet about other books that inspired him.Screw Business as UsualBillionaire and entrepreneur Richard Branson has one goal he wants to achieve flip capitalism upside down by focusing more on caring for people and the planet rather than profit.
In his bookScrew Business as Usual Branson writes how he s working to deconstruct capitalism and why you should change your perspective on our capitalistic society.Some readers might think it s a bit hypocritical for a billionaire such as Musk to recommend a book written by a billionaire who achieved his fortune through the same capitalistic society he opposes.
However Branson s guide to an eco friendly way of doing business aligns with Musk s attempts at making SpaceX and Tesla sustainable ventures.Like many of his other book reviews Musk took toTwitterto give his take onScrew Business as Usual Liked Screw Business as Usual a lot.
This approach should be taken to heart by all as it really is the smart move.
Benjamin Franklin An American LifeIn this intimate biography Walter Isaacson the best selling author of many other biographies about prominent figures gives the full scope of Benjamin Franklin s life from his time as a runaway apprentice to becoming one of the most influential political leaders in America.
The witty in depth look into Franklin s life and work shows how he helped create America s identity and values which still resonate today.Musk kept his Twitter followers updated during his journey of readingBenjamin Franklin An American Life.
He firsttweeted Am reading a great biography of Ben Franklin by Isaacson.
Highly recommended.Elon Musk Book Recommendations Outside of TwitterWhen he s not tweeting about his favorite books Musk still manages to talk about books during interviews or editorial reviews.
Below you ll find more of Elon Musk s favorite books ranging from a science fiction alien adventure to captivating biographies and business books.The Hitchhiker s Guide to the GalaxyAs an ambitious boy growing up in South Africa it s understandable why Musk looked to Douglas Adams s bookThe Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxyfor answers to his big questions.
The story follows Arthur Dent the last surviving man of Earth who hitchhikes around outer space to discover the truth about Earth s existence.
While it sounds like a funny space adventure on the surface The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxyactually provides satirical insight into philosophy and religion and reflects on what it truly means to be human.The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxyis often regarded as one of Elon Musk s favorite books.
In an interview with Alison van Diggelen host of Fresh Dialogues Musk said I readHitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxywhich is quite positive I think and it highlighted an important point which is that a lot of times the question is harder than the answer.
Einstein His Life and UniverseAlso authored by Walter Isaacson Einstein His Life and Universedetails the rise of Albert Einstein as he uses his imagination to become one of the most important figures in the field of science.
It s no wonder Musk looks to Einstein as an inspiration.
His biography shows that while he was often laughed at for questioning conventional wisdom he eventually proved them wrong by combining creativity and intelligence to answer the world s biggest questions.When speaking about the influential books he read to build his career Musk recommendedEinstein His Life and Universe saying I didn t read actually very many general business books but I like biographies and autobiographies I think those are pretty helpful.
Actually a lot of them aren t really business.
I also feel it s worth reading books on scientists and engineers.
Howard Hughes His Life and MadnessAuthored by Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele Howard Hughes His Life and Madnessdives deep into the mind of the business magnate and filmmaker that infamously became known for his reclusiveness and eccentric behavior later in life.
In addition to his work as a film producer and businessman he became one of the most important figures in aviation history by breaking many world records one of which includes flying around the world in 91 hours.In aninterview with CNN Musk said that he read Howard Hughes s biography and made a snide remark about the pilot and business magnate s behavior in his later years Definitely want to make sure I don t grow my fingernails too long and start peeing in jars.

When I was in high school ...
I got distinctions in two areas physics and computer science Musk said on the Third Row Tesla podcast in February.
Those were my two best subjects.
So at the time I thought I d most likely be doing physics at a particle accelerator as an adult.
A particle accelerator is a machine that propels charged particles such as protons or electrons at high speeds close to the speed of light so that physicists can probe the world of the infinitely small and conduct research according toCERN the European Organization for Nuclear Research which has the largest accelerator in the world .It seemed like a logical career choice for Musk as he was curious about the universe and loved science.
I thought OK I want to figure out what s the nature of the universe so I would go try working with people banging particles together and see what happens he said on the podcast.But in 1993 when Musk was about 22 years old his plans changed.
Things went along he said until the Superconducting Semi Collider got cancelled in the U.S. he said.
It was theworld s largest particle accelerator project at the time and was shut down after government funding was pulled according toWired.
I was like Woah.
What if I m working at a collider spend all these years and then the government just cancels it So that was like I m not going to do that.
At the time Musk was astudentatthe University of Pennsylvaniastudying physics and economics.
After he graduated in 1997 instead of working at a particle accelerator Musk used his computer science skills to found his first start up a city guide software company called Zip2.In 1999 Musk soldZip2 to Compaq for roughly 300 million.
Musk used the money from that sale to found X.com an online financial services platform that merged with Confinity in 2000 and later became PayPal.
In 2002 eBay purchased PayPal for 1.5 billion.But Musk felt his purpose was far greater than these internet start ups.
When I was a kid I had this existential crisis.
I was about 12 years old or something and I was like Well what does the world mean What s it all about Do we live in some meaningless existence And I was like OK we don t really know what the answer is obviously but the universe is the answer he said on the podcast.It s part of the reason Musk founded aerospace comapny SpaceX in 2002.
We must propagate a human civilization on Earth as far into the future as possible and become amulti planet species including colonizing Mars.On May 30 SpaceXsuccessfully launched two NASA astronautsinto orbit for the first time.
It was a milestone forhuman spaceflightand got Musk one step closer to achievinghis Mars ambitions.

CNBC on Instagram Young Elon Musk had two favorite subjects in high school physics and computer science.
So at the time he thought he d most likely be doing physics at a particle accelerator as an adult.
It seemed like a logical career choice for Musk as he was curious about the universe and loved science.
But in 1993 when Musk was about 22 years old his plans changed.
Things went along he said until the Superconducting Semi Collider got cancelled in the U.S.
At the time Musk was a student at the University of Pennsylvania studying physics and economics.
After he graduated in 1997 instead of working at a particle accelerator Musk used his computer science skills to found his first start up.

The instrument produced six grammes of oxygen per hour on each run or roughly the same amount as a small tree on Earth.According to researchers a scaled up MOXIE could be sent to Mars before a human mission to produce oxygen continuously at the rate of several hundred trees.
At that capacity the system should be able to produce enough oxygen to support people once they arrive as well as power a rocket for astronauts returning to Earth.As of now MOXIE s consistent output represents a positive first step in that direction.
The current MOXIE is built to run for brief times starting up and shutting down with each run depending on the rover s exploration schedule and mission tasks.
It is compact by design to fit within the Perseverance rover.
A complete oxygen factory however would include larger units that ideally ran continually.Click to share on Twitter Opens in new window Click to share on Facebook Opens in new window Click to share on LinkedIn Opens in new window Click to share on Telegram Opens in new window Click to share on WhatsApp Opens in new window Continue ReadingEP SPECIALSA Mother GoddessPublished1 year agoonDecember 22 2021ByPamarty VenkataRamanaAm a Blessed Soul my Ammaa Am not lonely Mother DearNever lonely from the beginningMummy ever with me alwaysFrom my first breath onwardsEver since stepping In hereFirst cries to beaming smilesBirth to birth and rebirthsLife to live and living AliveFeeding strength always as ownFeeling lively from umbilical cordMusical ways Of Mother NatureChords Of contentment and prideNotes Of love forever requiredAm a blessed soul my AmmaaAm not lonely Mother Dear ..

This is in contrast to the earlier times when both teachers and parents were among the favourites to be considered as Role Models.So a Ronaldo a Mohanlal Dr.APJ or a Bill Gates are more common answers.What then has been the reason for a change Predominantly and predictably technology has played a major role in this change and so have social media.
EASY access to information and the glorification of many characters including celebrities from various fields through umpteen channels and other platforms has possibly been one of the reasons.
Added to this are the marketing campaigns brand endorsements stage shows writeups and so on and so forth available just by sliding a finger on hand held devices.An essay on say Prof. C.V Raman or Srinivasa Ramanujan was an arduous task then that required flipping through books or pages of printed matter.
We had to depend on teachers or parents to get more information about them.
We looked up to them for inputs thus forming a different impression about their level of awareness.
The same could be done with effortless ease today thanks to anything and everything that is available online or in the Cloud.While we had relatively fewer modes of entertainment then the cinema or a restaurant park or an outing or social visits and of course much more of play teachers and parents gave us frequent doses of knowledge by mixing them with classes or through bedtime stories and during the family time .There was much for us to learn from them as the time spent together was qualitative in nature and openness was obvious.We saw in many or most of our teachers a value that could be hardly substituted by anything else and looked forward to their sessions as they taught from the heart and not from the books alone.
They were assumed to be power houses of knowledge and looking back I for sure on a personal note could say that without a second thought.Value Education which is separated today was an integral part of their lesson plan be it Hindi or Mathematics.
Their experience passion commitment and their roles as mentors played a significant part in this change among students not to forget THE FREEDOM THAT PARENTS GAVE TEACHERS IN DECIDING AND EXECUTING WHATEVER WAS BEFITTING.
Even the mention of parents being called to the school was enough to send chills down the spines of students.School wasn t just a platform for learning nor it is even today but was a place that students looked forward to going every day with cheer.
It was a like a get together to learn life skills along with lessons most of which aren t very different today either.
Naturality was evident as technology or gadgets weren t the topics of discussion nor were Facebook or Instagram posts or likes.
Friends laughed their heart out through the common things.
There was much fun and play.
Teachers had absolute control.At home both parents weren t working.
As children we knew that money never came easily as it does today.
Pocket money couldn t be dreamt of leave alone heard about.
We saw the struggles of parents we didn t dare question them.
We didn t have the luxury of selection of many things but were happy about what they chose or bought for us.
Somewhere we had this feeling that there were pairs of eyes constantly watching and guiding us wherever we went.There was an invisible guideline on what we were supposed to doConnection was real not virtual.
Lack of time was never discussed.
There was better communication more time for each other and together.
An impact was created gradually.There was an invisible guideline on what we were supposed to do.Times have changed they have to.
A new world driven by technology is already visible.
Sadly there is also cut throat competition that is mostly unhealthy and thus follows a mad rush to be on top just academically more than anything else.
Money has lost value and spending for more than what is required has gone up.
A majority of children has the impression that parents have enough with them.
Parents too go beyond means to provide the perceptible best for their children.On the contrary what has to be more evident is the foundation that existed earlier one that was strong morally and ethically without more of monetary considerations.
Learning the hard way was natural for most of the students themselves.While a majority of the current generation of teachers and parents is definitely knowledgeable and is tech savvy it would have this rather sensitive and difficult task of making an impact on a student community that is only just short of gadget addiction in keeping with the times.
Elders too seem to be as affected by this as their children.Also to be understood is that the pressure on parents and teachers today is more than what it used to be long back in the wake of a massive shift culturally economically technologically and emotionally.Practicing what is preached supporting and guiding children to explore themselves nurturing their talents and leading by example could put parents back on track to be their ideal Role Models.Teachers on the other hand need to empathize with children lift the ordinary ones to the higher slots create a level playing field and an equal opportunity environment for all of them to get exposed without bias.
Most importantly passion needs to be a key ingredient of their sessions than just the rush to cover the portions.This on paper may not seem to be missing though reality is in stark contrast to hearsay.While I am not under rating the present day teachers vis vis those of yore it would take more effort and commitment to be followed as a Role Model because the impact has to be felt amidst challenges most of which were absent then or were of a different manageable nature.It is possible and would lead to a better society driven by values and positivity.While at school and at home we have all heard of the adage Where there is a will there is a way .For those who put this across to children making it a reality wouldn t be a tough ask if backed by systematic action.May we have more of them.Click to share on Twitter Opens in new window Click to share on Facebook Opens in new window Click to share on LinkedIn Opens in new window Click to share on Telegram Opens in new window Click to share on WhatsApp Opens in new window Continue ReadingAdvertisementLatestPopularVideosFeatured7 months agoThe MOXIE experiment successfully produces oxygen on MarsEP SPECIALS8 months agoHow can Indian language assessment tests overcome existing issues to meet international standardsEP SPECIALS1 year agoA Mother GoddessEP SPECIALS2 years agoTeachers and Parents as Role Models for Students Why Actions must replace just theoryEP SPECIALS2 years agoWe need to do better in preventing diseases Dr. Avinash GuptaEP on FacebookTrendingEP SPECIALS2 years ago3 kinds of capital for Lifelong learningBUSINESS ECONOMY3 years ago Mitra Sambandha is what Chanakya says.

From tension in Belarus to Derek Chauvin s trial.TENSION IN BELARUSBY GUSTAVO REGO 23During a routine flight from Athens Greece to Vilnius Lithuania passengers of the Ryanair flight found themselves being redirected to the capital of Belarus Minsk.
They were escorted there by a Belarusian fighter jet under the pretense of a bomb threat by the Palestinian organisation Hamas.
Upon touching down in Minsk a search of the plane found that no bomb was on board and the flight was cleared to continue to Vilnius.
However Belarusian journalist and critic of the government Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend stayed behind.
They were arrested as soon as the plane had touched down.Protasevich was until recently the editor of Nexta a Telegram channel that was strongly against the government of Belarus.
Nexta has been used for organizing anti government protests leading to Protasevich being considered a terrorist by the Belarusian government.
Because of this he is facing up to 15 years in prison.
He has also written articles condemning the leader of Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko who has been in power since 1994.As this is still very much a developing story there are many details that are unclear.
The government of Belarus still maintains their claim that a bomb threat was made towards the flight going as far as saying that the threat was sent by a member of Hamas a Palestinian military group that has featured prominently in the news recently for completely unrelated reasons.
Hamas denies that they had anything to do with it.
Meanwhile Ryanair CEO Michael O Leary has expressed his belief that there were KGB agents on board the flight which Belarus has denied.
In addition a video was released on May 24th showing Protasevich confessing to the crimes that he was accused of but many are suspecting that this confession was coerced or even tortured out of him.Many people suspect that he has been rigging elections as well as using violence to suppress any protests against him.This has led to some countries placing sanctions on or cutting ties with Belarus.The international response to this particular incident has been widespread and intense with Polish Prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki calling it an unprecedented act of state terrorism.
A joint statement made by 8 countries refers to it asYet another blatant attempt by the Belarusian authorities to silence all opposition voices.The EU recommended that planes avoid flying over Belarus and both the EU and UK banned Belarusian airlines from their airspace.
In response to this Russia who is an ally of Belarus started rejecting flight plans that avoided Belarusian airspace.
The United States also imposed sanctions on Belarus on top of issuing a warning asking U.S citizens to avoid traveling to Belarus.As this story develops it has the potential to be a crucial tipping point.
It adds even more tension between the West Russia and Belarus.
As investigations continue to reveal details about what actually happened this tension could increase even further.
If Belarus decides to not release Protasevich that will increase the tension yet again.
This situation is very delicate and the way that it plays out over the coming weeks could be very important for people all around the world.DEREK CHAUVIN S TRIALBY LOUISE GUTBROD 23On May 25 2020 George Floyd was murdered by Derek Chauvin a white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee to George Floyd s neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds while Mr. Floyd was handcuffed face down in the street.
It is most likely that by now we all heard about this brutal incident.
It was all over the media and had an impartible effect on the world.
After the video footage went viral it spread like a beacon of light sparking worldwide protests against racism and excessive use of force by police.
This was only one of the many events in which people of colour were treated with injustice by the American police and will not be the last.
The Black Lives Matter movement of people protesting and giving awareness to a social problem that is carved so deeply into America s history and is still present in the lives of people of colour every day was a historical moment.
In cities all over the world people were kneeling for George Floyd and every black person that was ever placed under injustice.After the emotional racking Derek Chavin s trial went on for months and he was found guilty on three charges seconddegree murder third degree murder and manslaughter on the 20th April 2021.
The sensational trial became one of the most closely watched ones in decades.
Some activists claim that justice has been served and that they would feel as if a weight has been taken from their shoulders.It is a milestone in the history of police brutality against black citizens and the decision is a huge win for activists advocating for policing reform.
For America a country whose justice system barely keeps police officers accountable for killing on the job particularly where the victims are Black citizens the event was a landmark moment.
The conclusion may be seen as an indication that Mr. Floyd s death has shifted the country toward greater responsibility for police abuses and greater equity under the law.
How much will it change The American police department has been ignoring the problem of racism among their system for centuries and because of one public incident will it all change The answer to this is not easy and change is not guaranteed but people s awareness is awakened and they want to change.
A step towards change however is The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act which was passed by the white house on the 3rd March 2021.
It cites Mr. Floyd s legacy as a case to make specific improvements to core police practices such as prohibiting chokeholds and no knock warrants ending qualified immunity for officers and making it possible to hold police responsible for violations.Nonetheless sentencing is not spoken yet.
Throughout the emotional trial both the defence and the prosecution had heavy weighting arguments that influenced the jury and are to be taken into perspective by judging the result of this trial.
The prosecution by Steve Schleicher pleads with the emotions of the jury by portraying moments from George Floyd s life and describes his struggle under Chauvin s knee.
Imagining a police officer committing a crime might be the most difficult thing you have to set aside because that s just not the way we think about police officers Mr Schleicher told the 12 jurors who will decide the verdict.
What the defendant did was not policing.
What the defendant did was an assault.On the other hand The main strategy of Mr Chauvin defence led by the lawyer Eric Nelson was to raise doubts about George Floyds cause of death and to present Chauvin as a reasonable officer.
The defence also stated that one of the most possible ways to appeal is the extensive attention provided to the prosecution that may have swayed the jurors.Throughout the trial the jury heard from 45 witnesses and saw several hours of surveillance recording.
Eyewitnesses provided some of the most compelling evidence.
Several people sobbed as they watched the gruesome video of the incident and described feeling helpless as events unfolded.
Mr. Floyd s three year partner and his younger brother have testified.
Expert witnesses for the state testified that Mr. Floyd died from a lack of oxygen as a result of the restraint technique used by Chauvin and his colleagues.
A big question during the trial was if Chauvin himself will testify or not.
In the end Chauvin opted not to testify citing his right not to incriminate himself with his answers.
Regardless of the try of the defence in the end Derek Chauvil was found guilty and is now in custody awaiting his sentence.
This was one of the first times a white police man was proven guilty for murder during service.
It s marking a watershading moment and together with the public awareness we might bring change to the American Legal System.Human beings make decisions in highly stressful situations that they believe to be right in the very moment it is occurring Mr NelsonUNPRINCELY PRINCEBY MUSKAN BONINGER 23 If I were reincarnated I would wish to be returned to earth as a killer virus to lower human population levels.
His wish came true when his life came to an end.
The Duke of Edinburgh also known as Prince Philip died on April 9th at the age of 99 at rather an inconvenient moment.
The Royal Family was accused of racism by Prince Harry s wife the Duchess of Sussex Meghan Marcle.Can the Duke s death cause more scandal than he has caused alive Now that Philip s legacy is being recounted many people start to notice his comments through another point of view.
He is no longer accompanied by his british humor because that lies in the ground with the prince but with racism sexism and ignorance.Prince Philip was known to have made comments such as I don t think a prostitute is more moral than a wife but they are doing the same thing.
People laughed or agreed with this remark.
Now people actually start to notice that this is a sexist comment and that a wife is someone more than a woman used for sexual pleasure.Back in 2001 Philip told a boy to lose weight if he wished to become an astronaut.lose weight I don t think a prostitute is more moral than a wife but they are doing the same thing.
This was considered a hilarious joke to everyone at the time but the child s feelings were definitely hurt.
Since we were toddlers we were taught to not judge and point out anyone.
We were taught to not hurt others feelings purposely yet there he was using his noble title to make cruel comments.Only one year later the lovely Duke told a 14 year old asian boy that he looked like he was on drugs after asking who else was on them.
Not only did he make presumptuous comments but he also told the president of Nigeria that his traditional robe looked like he was ready for bed and compared Ethiopian art to The kind of thing my daughter would bring back from school art lessons.He made racist comments even in China telling a group of british students in China During a meeting he said If it has got four legs and it is not a chair if it has got two wings and it flies but is not an aeroplane and if it swims and it is not a submarine the Cantonese will eat it.
Some say this is the unique british humor of the prince while others say this is blunt racism.
If these comments are funny should we teach our friends to talk like this just to have a humorous moment or is this just proof of lack of respect and racism in the Prince Despite his snarky remarks he was loved and idealised by his subjects.
He made racist comments even in China telling a group of british students in China If you stay here much longer you ll all be slittyeyed.
I don t think a prostitute is more moral than a wife but they are doing the same thing.The duke was called rude racist sexist and plain insensitive.
Prince Philip now deceased became well known for his long record of inappropriate or awkward gaffes.
A monarch has power but power means responsibility.
Even if you have no power even if it s a futile title it means that certain comments must be filtered and certain actions must be avoided.
Being married to The Queen of England makes him someone people look up to so he should have set examples for others.
Yet what he taught us was that having Prince as a title does not necessarily mean that you act like one and that his actions never had a consequence.
Those are just the perks of being a Prince of Britain.BIDEN S FIRST 100 DAYS IN OFFICEBY SOPHIA LOVALO 22Joe Biden completed his 100th day in office on Wednesday April 29 and is leading the country in a direction that most Americans are feeling optimistic about.
Considering the severity of the pandemic and the divided political climate of the US when President Biden was inaugurated critics say has done a rather good job of managing the situation.
Biden made a variety of promises during his campaign some of which he followed through with and others which are still in the works but one thing he has done is remain under the radar.
The director for the center of Presidential History at Southern Methodist University described Biden s approach People aren t paying that much attention to Biden because he s not doing anything as crazy as the last guy .
So what exactly has Biden been up to these past three months One of Biden s main priorities seems to be counseling the country through the remainder of the pandemic.
One of his biggest promises was to have 100 million Americans vaccinated by the end of his first one hundred days in office.
This promise was doubled in March to 200 million and is currently considered one of the biggest successes of his presidency thus far.
The seven day rolling average for vaccines given has also heavily increased starting at 770 000 when Biden took office and now approaching over 3 million.
In addition as of Biden s 100th day in office over 80 of the senior population has received at least one shot and 25 of the total American adult population was fully vaccinated.
In relation to the pandemic situation Biden s 1.9 trillion dollar Covid Relief Bill would probably be considered his greatest achievement.
The bill is referred to as the American Rescue Plan and aims to dedicate funds to fighting the virus as well as providing economic relief to many Americans such as stimulus payments and unemployment insurance.
During his presidential address Biden described his hopes for the Covid 19 situation This country will be vaccinated soon our economy will be on the mend and our kids will be back in school.
Though these ideas seem to be realistic some argue that Biden s progress regarding the pandemic was bound to happen regardless of who was president.
Though this might be partly true the steps he has taken such as increasing vaccine production and vaccine distribution sites have indisputably contributed to significant improvement regarding the health crisis.Biden s second priority seems to be undoing most of the executive orders that were put into place under president Trump.
Among the many controversial actions of his predecessor were a handful of executive orders including a ban on transgender military members construction of a new boarder wall separating Mexico from the United States and the decision to leave the Paris Climate Agreement.
All of these were removed and belong to the forty plus executive orders that Biden has put into place so far.
President Biden was praised for removing many of Trump s most controversial policies but has also been heavily criticised for the volume of orders.
Tennessee senator Marsha Blackburn a republican took to twitter regarding the situation saying You can t govern with a pen and a phone but Democrats continue to defend Biden as working to end the burden and suffering that the current health crisis has brought upon Americans.
For the first time in eight years climate change has finally been made a national priority.
Biden has been described as busy without making much noise and this definitely applies to his approach towards the climate crisis.
In April before the mark of his first 100 days in office Biden committed to his promise of holding a global climate summit among other world leaders.
During the summit Biden discussed goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the US by 50 by 2030 as part of the Paris Climate agreement which the US rejoined in February of 2021.Biden has had a relatively successful first few months in office but there are still a few things that the administration is struggling with one of the most prominent is the immigration problem.
During Trump s time in office the immigration crisis at the United States Southern Border was one of the most badly handled and controversial situations.
Even under Biden s desire for a more neutral approach this remains a difficult and prevalent issue.
The Biden administration has yet to make any promising announcements regarding the issue and has asked the American people for patience while they try to find a more humanitarian solution.
Gun violence has been another area of criticism for President Biden.
After a string of mass shootings in the past few weeks this issue has been brought back into the spotlight and remains a highly disputed topic in congress.
Unfortunately despite some action on this issue Biden is relying on definitive long term legislation to facilitate the large scale changes and these remain up to congress and out of his authority.S C I E N C ESPACEX VS. BLUE ORIGIN THE BILLIONAIRE SPACE RACE COMMENCESBY CARLO VITALE 22The race for the moon has started and this time it is being fueled by none other than the world s leading billionaires each commanding their own company constantly trying to win over the eyes and attention of NASA.
Elon Musk founder of companies such as Tesla Neuralink and The Boring Company leads the race with his company known as SpaceX.
SpaceX was founded in 2002 with the plan to turn the United States attention to Mars as well as to create reusable rockets that would lower the cost of space related operations.
It has made various strides in this direction and has even picked up some achievements such as being the first private company to send an aircraft to the international space station ISS along with being the first to send humans to the ISS as well.
On the other side of the ring stands Jeff Bezos founder of Amazon.inc along with his company Blue Origin.
Similarly to Musk Blue Origin was founded in the early 2000s with the same goal of making cheaper and reusable rockets.
Although Blue Origin focuses more on the touristic side of space with their new sightseeing rocket planning to launch on July 20th they have also been competing with SpaceX s goal of exploration with their rover called the Blue Moon .
Although both companies seem to both be making significant advancements in both of their departments their competition arises when NASA can only support one of the two companies.
Last year NASA declared that they would fund one of the new and uprising space exploration related companies to build them a lander to bring astronauts back to the moon.
For the past few months they have been analyzing each company s lunar designs and studying them vigorously.
SpaceX proposed adapting a giant rocket named the Starship which would be the one used to travel to Mars as well.
Blue Origin s proposal was a collaboration of three experienced aerospace companies to be called the National Team.Towards the end of last month NASA picked their winner SpaceX giving them a 2.9 billion dollar contract for them to carry out their work.
This as expected didn t sit well with the losers of the competition.
Bezos has filed a 50 page protest towards the federal Government Accountability Office challenging the contract given to SpaceX.
Bezos claims that their success shouldn t be based on jousting for government contracts along with the claim that NASA made a mistake in picking SpaceX.
Bob Smith chief executive of Blue Origin believes that their proposal was the clear superior of the two and that NASA had to address their errors .
Smith also adds that NASA should have stuck to their initial proposal of supporting both companies.NASA had in fact originally planned to support more than one company as they had put much emphasis on the importance of competition.
In various interviews NASA representatives have stated that competition is necessary for their success in space as it drives each company to push further beyond and for NASA not to rely on just one source of success.
However this is far from what is happening today.This is most likely due to Congress only providing them with 850 million dollars a quarter of what they expected.
Smith also calls out NASA by saying that Blue Origin had placed a much higher bid than SpaceX but NASA had gone back and renegotiated with SpaceX an opportunity that none of the other competitors had.
Smith says We didn t get a chance to revise and that is fundamentally unfair .Although the decision might change in the near future as the Governmental Accountability Office has 100 days to respond to the protest it seems that SpaceX will come out on top this time.
However this does not mean that all hope is lost for Blue Origin.
NASA has already declared another competition in which all the losing competitors will have a chance to win and advance their projects.
This will hopefully give Blue Origin the support they need so we can see Musk and Bezos go head to head once again and push each other towards new heights and successes.More articles from this publisher from Tuskan Times Volume 9 Issue 5 IS THERE LIFE AFTER DEATH ALI...from Tuskan Times Volume 9 Issue 5 THE POWER OF MRNA DEVAKI MENONfrom Tuskan Times Volume 9 Issue 5 WHY THE SILENT TREATMENT IS HA...from Tuskan Times Volume 9 Issue 5 THE RISE OF DIGITAL ART LORENZ...from Tuskan Times Volume 9 Issue 5 THE GOAT TOM BRADY GIACOMO ME...

In fact his unhealthy habits were bad enough to recently garner worry and criticism from his father Errol Musk.In an August 2022interview the 79 year old took a swipe at his son s physical appearance in recent photos that showed the SpaceX founder in an unflattering shirtless pose on a yacht in Mykonos.
The Elder Musk coolly suggested his son take diet pills to cut weight.Shirtless Elon Musk vacations in Mykonos on luxury yachthttps t.co xH4luUMTgrpic.twitter.com j4N21y5wWT Page Six PageSix July 18 2022Lately Musk has been making space in his routine for some new healthy habits likeintermittent fasting and we re here for it.Here everything we know about how the wealthiest man in the world eats works out sleeps approaches mental health and his stance on prescription drugs.He Does Intermittent FastingJust weeks after those unfortunate photos surfaced the billionaire net worth 250.5 billion has the ultimate clap back losing 20 pounds.How Intermittent fasting.On advice of a good friend I ve been fasting periodically feel healthier Elon Musk elonmusk August 28 2022Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating.
Far from a fad intermittent fasting is popular for its potential to reduce weight 1 .
Over 20 lbs down from my unhealthy peak weight Musk told his Twitter followers.And the perks don t stop there.
Many studies have shown intermittent fasting can help reset digestion 2 cut cravings 3 and protect you from a variety of conditions and diseases 4 .Musk uses the quite good Zero fasting appto track his fasting progress.

When asked his secret to looking more fit ripped and healthy in October 2022 Musk replied his secret was fasting and Wegovy.And Wegovy Elon Musk elonmusk October 2 2022Wegovy also known as Semaglutide is an injectable drug approved by the FDA to help treat type 2 diabetes.
Like other diabetes drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro Wegovy isblowing up on TikTokand praised by celebrities as a miracle weight loss drug.One study published inJAMAfound when paired with intensive behavioral therapy and a low calorie diet participants who were injected once weekly with Semaglutide lost significantly more weight than those injected with a placebo 5 .If it sounds too good to be true it s because it is.
Cutting the weight always comes at a cost even Kate Moss regrets saying nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.
According toInsider Semaglutide is changing people s tastes and making them hate their favorite foods.
Plus Ozempic faceisn t cute.Luckily Semaglutide is not the only diabetes drug with health benefits.Metforminis also used off label to treat obesity cancer and heart disease.
Plus it has a direct anti inflammatory effect 6 .Diabetes drugs Miracle Diabetes Weight Loss Drugs Are Back In Stock.

Researchers atBoston University School of Medicinefound that people who consume diet soda daily arethree times more likelyto suffer from a stroke or dementia within the next ten years.
Plus aspartame the artificial sweetener found in most diet sodas has been linked to migraines irritable mood anxiety and insomnia 7 .Ironically researchers in China founda bit of coffee might actually do Musk some good.
Their findings suggest that drinking 2.5 to 4.5 cups of black coffee a day can lower your risk of death by almost 30 percent.MORE ENERGYWant to Live Longer Pour Another Cup of Sweet Sweet Coffee.Can and Should You Drink Coffee While Intermittent Fasting He s Not the Healthiest EaterWhen it comes to his eating schedule Musk might be onto something.But his unconventional approach to food raised eyebrows in the past.
If there was a way I could not eat so I could work more I would not eat says Musk in the 2015 bookTesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.There was a period in his college years where Musk survived on just 1 per day.
My threshold for existing was pretty low he said on theStarTalkpodcast.
You get really tired of hot dogs and oranges after a while.
No kidding.Recently Musk s been eating more.
Food s great he told Joe Rogan in 2020 onan episode of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast.
However his diet still has little to do with his health.
I d rather eat tasty food and live a shorter life the 51 year old admits.One study suggests men of Musk s age still have a few years to turn things around.
The study found that swapping a bad Western diet for a healthier one by age 60 can add up to eight years to your life 8 .Cleaning up your diet isn t rocket science.
Focus on balanced plates loaded with all yourmicro and macronutrientneeds.
Add on some of thebest foods for menlike lean protein whole grains colorful fruits and vegetables legumes and seeds and you have a recipe for success.Healthy eatingThe Best Foods Every Man Should EatThese Anti Aging Foods Can Add Years to Your LifeHe s Not VegetarianMusk used to be an herbivore but he switched up his eating habits circa 2013.
I tried being a vegetarian but I don t really think we re designed to be vegetarians he toldThe Guardian.
Some of my best friends are vegetarians even vegans which is tricky when you re trying to go out for dinner.
Aside from struggles at the dinner table Musk shared with fans in 2019 that he still believes in the ethical treatment of animals but he s focused his climate change efforts elsewhere.
A vegan vegetarian diet helps a little but isn t critical Musk says.I support people choosing whatever diet makes them happy but it s true that everyone going vegan still wouldn t stop climate change.
Moving billions of tons of hydrocarbons from deep underground into the atmosphere oceans is fundamentally the issue.
Elon Musk elonmusk December 30 2019Should you consider going meatless Eating a plant based diet has been shown to reduce saturated fats and boost fiber 9 .But it s not all good news.
A 2019 study compared 137 plant based products with their meat counterparts and found that only four percent of those plant based alternatives were lower in sodium with sodium content ranging from 500mg per 100 grams up to a staggering 1 200mg 10 .Plus meat is one of the best sources of protein iron andvitamin B12 which can boost your energy and mood.
By cutting meat out getting those nutrients isn t impossible but more challenging.Plant Based DietVitamin B12 Lifts Your Energy and Mood.
Here s How to Get More of It.Kevin Hart Bets on Veganism With His New Plant Based Fast Food ChainHe s Trying to Workout More But Hates It To be totally frank I wouldn t exercise at all if I could he toldJoe Roganin 2020.When he does work out Musk likes to lift weights.
He also shared with Rogan that he doesn t love running but when he musters up the energy to run on the treadmill he likes to watch TV.By exercising more regularly he could boost his lifespan and reduce his risk of chronic disease 11 .
But Musk admits it s been increasingly difficult to stay in shape with age.
The older I get the harder it is to stay lean that s for sure he told Rogan.More recently he s expressed more interest in getting in shape.
I gotta workout out and be in better shape Musk told theFull Sendpodcast just one day after his father s condemning interview surfaced.He even shared how he plans to do it.
I m going to switch from immediately looking at my phone first thing in the morning to working out for at least 20 minutes he says.If Musk does work out in the morning many studies suggest it may help him cut the weight more than afternoon workouts 12 especially if he works out before breakfast 13 .
However the efforts of said plan remain to be seen.GET FITIf You re a Human You Need a Functional Fitness RoutineThe Best Time of Day to Exercise According to Your BodyHe Doesn t SleepElon Musk is tired.
He has long waded deeply into the weeds of his companies.
In 2018 he admitted his120 hour work weeksoften drove him tosleep on the Tesla factory floor.
Musk revealed his schedule left him exhausted shocking nutty and like he d burnt out a bunch of neurons .In recent years Musk pared down his work schedule to a more sustainable 80 to 90 hours.But since recently taking ownership of Twitter in late October 2022 his workload is back to 120 hours per week.These days you can find him sleeping at Twitter headquarters in San Francisco where he s also provided beds for employees.
I go to sleep wake up work go to sleep wake up work do that seven days a week says Musk.
I ll do that for a while no choice but I think once Twitter is set on the right path it is a much easier thing to manage than SpaceX or Tesla.
He usually gets about six hours of sleep going to bed at 3 a.m. and getting up around 9 or 9 30 a.m. well below the recommended eight hours.When he is in the mood for sleep Musk admitted he s fairly nocturnal anyways and turns to Ambien a common sleep medication for help.
It s often a choice of no sleep or Ambien he confessed to theNew York Timesin 2018.Sleep requirements can vary among people experts recommend seven to nine hours of sleep for optimal health.
Research suggests that after a good night s sleep you may feel less anxious and more confident 14 .One study found that men who slept less than five hours a night for one week had significantly lower levels of testosterone than when they had a full night s rest a 10 15 decrease in testosterone production on average 15 .
Too little sleep has also been linked to depression 16 .SLEEP BETTERNot Getting Enough Sleep Could Have This Terrible Side EffectThese Science Backed Strategies Will Help You Fall Asleep FastHis Back HurtsNo thanks to his inane sleeping hours Musk struggles with back and neck pain.
I m sorry for squirming around.
I have quite severe back pain Musk recently told a lawyer during a trial in San Francisco.He traces his pain to a birthday party that was thrown years ago which was attended by a sumo wrestler.
Musk who studied karate judo and Brazilian jiu jitsu in his youth took to the ring.
He managed according to him to throw his 350 pound opponent resulting in an injury to his spine.Managed to throw him but it cost me smashing my c5 c6 disc 8 years of mega back pain Finally fixed with c5 c6 disc fusion.
Elon Musk elonmusk March 21 2022The billionaire has also battled intense neck pain.
In response to rumors circulating in 2020 about a new scar on his neck Musk confirmed he had two surgeries the first a failure to address his neck pain.Peep Musk s neck scar which can be seen in photos circa 2020 post surgery.He Has Asperger sWhether Musk s genius strikes you with intrigue or fear there s undeniable curiosity behind the inner workings of his brain.In recent years Musk has opened up.
He first publicly disclosed in May 2021 that he has Asperger s syndrome when he appeared onSaturday Night Live.To the delight of fans in his May 2022TED Talk Musk gave more insight into how he learned to work with his Asperger s instead of against it.Growing up social cues were not intuitive so I was very bookish Musk recalls.
Others could intuitively understand what was meant by something.
I would take something very literally as if the words that were spoken were exactly what they meant.
Despite communication struggles Musk s intense specialized interest in science and technology was amplified by his hyper focused mind a common trait among people with autism.
My obsession with truth is why I studied physics he says because physics attempts to understand the truth of the universe.
He Not Afraid of DeathIn an interview withAxel Springerin March 2022 Musk said he would like to maintain his health for a longer period of time but I am not afraid of dying he said.
I think it would come as a relief.
Health isn t the only concern Musk has about old age.
I don t think we should try to have people live for a really long time he says.
That would cause asphyxiation of society because the truth is most people don t change their minds.
They just die.
So if they don t die we will be stuck with old ideas and society wouldn t advance.
LIVE LONGERThis Diabetes Drug Might Help Us All Live LongerScientists Are Working on Drugs that Kill Zombie Cells to Help You Live to 200He Hates Some Drugs and Loves Others Musk isn t a doctor and has zero medical credentials.
Yet he s not shy about railing against Adderall amongst other medications in yet another infamous Twitter rant.Adderall is an anger amplifier.
Avoid at all costs.
Elon Musk elonmusk April 29 2022In other tweets he complainedWellbutrin is worse than Adderall shared afriend had bad experiences with Ritalin and suggestedpsychedelic drugs and ketamine as better treatmentsfor mental health struggles.All the drugs Musk warns against are prescription medications well established in medical practice.
But psychedelics and ketamine are still in early stages of testing.According to theUS Food and Drug Administration Adderall treats ADHD and helps individuals who lack of attention to detail make careless mistakes or lack sustained attention.
Ritalin is another common ADHD drug theFDA sayscan reduce impulsivity.
Wellbutrin can help treat symptoms of depression.As far as Musk s drugs of choice there is some emerging science to back up his claims.
One recent study examined the effects of microdosing the psychedelic psilocybin on 953 people.
It found improvements in mood mental health and psychomotor ability physical movements related to cognitive processing 17 but more research is needed.According toHarvard two types of ketamine are used to treat depression.
Ketamine infusion was approved as an anesthetic by the FDA years ago and is now used off label to treat depression.

The boy died just 10 weeks later fromsudden infant death syndrome or SIDS.The new father rarely mentioned his loss but expressed his sympathy in an email chain with the father of an 18 year old boy who died in a fiery Tesla crash in 2018.
There is nothing worse than losing a child Musk wrote according toBloomberg.

Now it is an online school that does not have a grading system but teaches courses in artificial intelligence coding and applied science according to the websitefor the school now known as Astra Nova.
The kids really like going to school Musk said onBTV in China in 2017.
I think that s a good sign They actually think vacations are too long.
They want to go back to school.
But in a 2021interview on the Clubhouse app Musk admitted that his kids were raised by the internet.
Well my observation is my kids were mostly educated by YouTube and Reddit and then you know and their I guess classmates he said.
And I guess there were lessons as well but judging by the amount of time they spent online it seemed like most of their education is actually coming from online.

The internet went wild over the boy s bizarre name which the former couple seemed to disagree on how to pronounce.On Instagram the singer wrote It s just X like the letter X.
Then A.I.
Like how you said the letter A then I.
However Musk said onthe Joe Rogan Experience podcast that X is spoken like the letter while the is pronounced like ash.

He also provided a deeper look into his parenting style.
Right now there s not much I can do Musk said.
Grimes has a much bigger role than me right now.
When the kid gets older there will be more of a role for me he continued.
I think just doing what I ve done with my other kids.
If I have a trip for Tesla to China for example I ll bring the kids with me and we ll go see the Great Wall or we took the bullet train from Beijing to Xian and saw the Terracotta Warriors.

Far too many people are under the illusion that Earth is overpopulated even though birth rate trends are so obviously headed to population collapse.

Here s what happenedRyan LukeSeptember 7 2021Table of Contents Elon wishes he did not need to eatMy regular diet compared to Elon s dietMy breakfast for a weekMy lunch for a weekMy dinner for a weekMy total cost of food for the week How Elon Musk s diet made me feelLack of energyWeight lossElon Musk s diet todayFacebookFlipboardLinkedInEmailPocketTwitterRelated Stories How you become your spouse overtime according to scienceRumble CEO Ashley Camerini on making a workout brand thrive during a pandemicWhy you need to get more daylightThis article was updated on September 1 2021Did you know Elon Muskchallenged himselfto live on one dollar a day for food when he was 17 It s true Elon was intervieweda few years ago and detailed his odd diet and how he was able tosuccessfully do it for a while.He challenged himself to see if he could control this aspect of his life while focusing more on his projects.Elon wishes he did not need to eatElon stated If there was a way that I could not eat so I could work more I would not eat.
As the main staples Elon s diet consisted of hot dogs oranges pasta and green peppers.
Because I have a great deal of respect for Elon and his ability to create I wanted to see if I could complete his challenge of living on one dollar a day.To be as accurate as possible I researched the inflation rate from when Elon was 17 years old until now.It turns out one dollar in 1989 would be the equivalent of about 2.20 today.
I decided to round up to two dollars a day for this challenge to see if I could do it.My regular diet compared to Elon s dietMy usual routine consists of three meals a day.
I usually have a breakfast bar and coffee in the morning.Lunch is made with either chicken or steak for protein complimented with grains and a mixed salad.
Dinner also involves animal protein and a couple of vegetable sides.Needless to say mynormal dietis much more than 2 per day so I knew it would be a challenge to restrict my spending by that much.
At two dollars per day I would need to feed myself for seven days for 14.00 or less.My breakfast for a weekI am perfectly content eating the same thing every day so I planned my week ahead of time.I bought 18 eggs for 2.00 and ate two each morning 0.29 per morning for seven days .I also purchased a five pound bag of brown rice for 3.38.
I split this into seven servings 0.48 per serving and ate one serving for breakfast.The total cost of breakfast for the week 5.38My lunch for a weekFor lunch I made Rotini pasta.
I purchased two boxes of Walmart brand Garden Rotini in the 16 ounce box for 1.00 each.I split the 32 ounces into seven servings for lunch 0.28 per day .
I also purchased generic 24 ounce pasta sauce for 1.50 and split it over my lunch pasta 0.21 per day .For a side I purchased a three pound bag of mandarin oranges for 3.00 and split them evenly into 14 sides.
I used them for lunch and dinner 0.21 per day .The total cost of lunch for the week 4.90My dinner for a weekI went with the eight pack of Bar S jumbo hot dogs for 1.16.
I also purchased an eight pack of whole wheat hot dog buns for 0.87.I did cheat here because I did not have enough money for ketchup so I used some I already had in the refrigerator.I ate the mandarin oranges as a dinner side which equaled 0.21 each night.The total cost of dinner for the week 3.50My total cost of food for the week After adding it all up I spent a total of 13.87 on food for the week.
I was able to do it for less than my goal of 14.00 but only by 0.13.How Elon Musk s diet made me feelBefore I started the Elon Musk challenge I drank one cup of coffee each day.
When I started the diet I could not afford coffee so I was forced to drink only water for the week.This led to serious caffeine withdrawal headaches for the first three days.
I was not expecting to have to deal with headaches which were more difficult than I envisioned.Lack of energyBefore going on Elon s diet I ate three large meals a day and was rarely hungry.
However after a week on Elon Musk s diet I found I was drained and hungry most of the time.I assume it was mostly due to the large decrease in my caloric intake.
My body was accustomed to eating 2 500 calories a day and the Elon Musk diet decreased my calories to around 1 000 1 500.Weight lossOne benefit of this diet was the fact I lost two pounds.
Unfortunately it was not a healthy way to lose weight since it felt like I was starving myself.While I was able to complete his diet challenge I found that myhealth suffereddue to eating low quality food and not enough calories.Elon Musk s diet todayElon has come a long way since his diet challenge in 1989.
His normal routine today consists of coffee in the morning and a small lunch he can eat in five minutes or less.His dinner choices usually involve one of his favorite dishes which include French cuisine or American barbeque.Elon no longer watches what he eats and onlyexercisesone to two times a week.
For a man who is so busy it seems like food still gets in the way of his progress.More DietElon MuskExerciseHow ToMorning RoutineSuccessful HabitsLadders PressMore from LaddersI did 8 rounds of interviews and still didn t get the jobThis is what work will look like in 2030 and it isn t pretty I d give it a 10 out 10 2023Ladders Inc.ProductsJob SearchLadders RecruiterExpert NetworkHighest Paying JobsHighest Paying CompaniesHighest Paying CareersHighest Paying IndustriesCities StatesRemote JobsHelpCareer AdviceFAQSMember HelpRecruiter HelpContact UsUnsubscribeAbout LaddersCompanyEditorial TeamLadders EstimatesPress MediaPrivacyTerms of UseEditorial PolicyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationSite MapWork at Ladders

At least it s obviously not curated Some day I should probably write what my fictionalized version of reality is he said in a tweet.As we mentioned earlier that Musk is pretty open about sharing his thoughts on Twitter and was also asked what would happen if Tesla and SpaceX were to go bankrupt.
The Tesla CEO was candid in admitting what would happen if his two major companies Tesla and SpaceX were to go bankrupt.
He said that if his two companies go bankrupt then he too will go bankrupt before adding as it should be .Start a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBEVisual StoriesApple Arcade games coming in April 2023Gadgets10 noise cancelling headphones to check out in 2023GadgetsAmazon Prime Gaming free games coming in April 2023GadgetsHow to view your old likes and comments on InstagramGadgets Top selling PC games on SteamGadgets10 Mac keyboard shortcuts you should check outGadgetsHow to auto delete your Telegram accountGadgetsHow to hide your WhatsApp details from unsaved numbersGadgetsGod of War Ragnarok gets New Game Plus mode Key highlightsGadgets10 most downloaded games on PS5 right nowGadgets123ElectionsKarnataka Election NewsElections 2023Assembly Elections 2023Karnataka Elections 2023Mizoram ElectionsChhattisgarh ElectionsMadhyaPradesh ElectionsTelangana ElectionsTOP TRENDSDC vs MI Live ScoreRahul Gandhi in WayanadLouisville shootingK S EshwarappaVande Bharat ExpressIPL Live ScoreTrending StoriesIn TechEntire WebsiteLive India reports 5 676 new cases of Covid in last 24 hours79 rise in weekly cases Kerala Maha Delhi lead surge in Covid infectionsAmit Shah talks tough in Arunachal China says harmful to peace Papalpreet Singh Amritpal Singh s close aide taken to Assam3 day marathon meetings later BJP yet to finalize first list of K taka poll candidatesupGrad integrates its Study Abroad businessesLPU s record placementsLive Congress leader Sachin Pilot s day long hunger strike beginsKerala train attack Shahrukh planned to burn entire compartment Bengaluru hoteliers to boycott Amul products buy only NandiniKarnataka polls BJP releases 1st list of 189 candidates includes 52 fresh facesK taka live BJP fields BSY s son from ShikaripuraHow India can be a country of 5 000 tigersTwitter no longer an independent company becomes X CorpDC vs MI Live Rohit fires 29 ball fiftyLive Delhi reports 980 new Covid cases positivity rate 26 Why world s biggest milk producer is thinking importsWhy IMD s monsoon forecast is good news for IndiaIn pivot beyond China Cook to open first Apple stores in IndiaAdani rout has retail India investors snapping up group s stocksAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal PolicyPrivacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamEi SamayI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMiss KyraMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth Fitness TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosHot on the WebRelationships TipsK DramaWatermelon RecipesKiara AdvaniPushpa 2Rahul VaidyaParenting TipsBest DishesJuhi ChawlaNick JoeTop TrendsDC vs MI Live ScoreRahul Gandhi in WayanadLouisville shootingK S EshwarappaVande Bharat ExpressIPL Live ScoreAmul Nadini ControversySachin PilotAmritpal SinghKarnataka Election LiveCoronavirus NewsLingayats in KarnatakaFaf Du PlessisTax SavingsBank Holidays in AprilKarnataka Elections 2023IPL Schedule 2023IPL 2023 Points TableTrending TopicsSalman KhanNayantharaSummer Trip In IndiaImmunity Boosting HerbsSrabanti ChatterjeeCelebs In Swimming PoolMrunal ThakurDesi DishesSamanthasAmruta KhanvilkarAnjali AroraMika Rakhi Kissing VideoAkshara SinghRich FoodShehnaaz GillSalman KhanVivo Y55sLaptops under 30000WiFi RoutersTablets under 15000Living and entertainmentiDivaMensXP.comFeminaETimesGraziaZoomTravel DestinationsBombay TimesCricbuzz.comFilmfareOnline SongsTVLifestyleLongwalks AppNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaMagicbricksTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgets NowCareersColombiaCopyright 2023 Bennett Coleman Co.

But in 2019 the film that most captured Musk s imagination was the critically acclaimed Parasite as Muskrevealed on Twitter on Christmas Eve.
Elon Musk elonmusk December 24 2019 Parasite is aSouth Korean satirical thrillerwritten and directed by Bong Joon Ho.

The older I get the harder it is to stay lean that s for sure the Tesla CEO said on a recentepisodeof The Joe Rogan Experience podcast.In the interview the 48 year old billionaire added that he likes eating tasty food and wishes he could do without exercise.
Here s what else Musk said he does He lifts weights but doesn t love the treadmillMusk said he s been living in Boca Chica Village Texas while he works on SpaceX s next generation rocket Starship which is designed to go to Mars and the moon.Besides working I don t have much to do Musk told Rogan presumably before X A 12 his son with Claire Boucher aka Grimes was born on Monday .
So he told Rogan he s had more time to exercise even though he s not a fan.
To be totally frank I wouldn t exercise at all if I could Musk said.
I prefer not to exercise.
While Musk has a personal trainer he admitted that it s been a while since they worked out together.
Instead he said he lifts some weights on his own.Many successful people likeMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadellaand evenWhite House advisor and immunologist Anthony Fauci swear by running for mental clarity and stress relief.
But Musk said he doesn t love running.
When Musk does go for a run on the treadmill he likes to watch TV.
Maybe watch a show that you know if there s a compelling show that like pulls you in he said.In terms of Musk s other active interests he told Rogan who is a martial artist that he s dabbled in Taekwondo karate judo and Brazilian jiu jitsu.Musk added that he sent his kids to jiu jitsu from the age of 6.
In addition to the new baby Musk has five sons with his first wife Justine Musk twins Griffin and Xavier 16 plus triplets Damian Saxon and Kai 14.
Tasty food over healthy foodMusk s unconventional approach to food raised eyebrows in the past.
If there was a way that I could not eat so I could work more I would not eat he said in the 2015 book Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future by Ashlee Vance.There was a period in his college years when he purposefullyonly spent 1 CAD on food a day eating foods like hot dogs peppers oranges and pasta.Nowadays he has a different view.
Food s great Musk said on the podcast.
I d rather eat tasty food and live a shorter life he said.
Don t tell his mother Maye Musk who had along career as a registered dietitian.
Musk however is still mindful of weight gain and its effects on other factors such as the strength of your immune system.
Being overweight is a big deal he said.A tip for better sleepSome billionaires likeBill Gates and Jeff Bezos rely on seven or eight hours of sleep a night to stay productive and focused.Musk on the other hand sometimes works80 to 90 hours a week which doesn t leave much time for shut eye.
In a 2018New York Times interview he said that it s often a choice of no sleep or Ambien referring to the sleep medication.Still Musk shared a useful bit of advice with regards to sleep quality.
Eating before you go to bed is a real bad idea and actually negatively affects your sleep he said on the podcast.
Indeed eating before bedcan cause heartburnbecause your food isn t able to properly digest.
This sensation can also impact the quality of sleep you re able to get so you wake up more tired.
Musk said that he avoids alcohol and food at least two to three hours before bed.
Your quality of sleep will improve and your general health will improve a lot he said.
It s a big deal.

It symobilizes a website link url.Copy LinkRead in appI plowed through 14 bags of pasta in 31 days.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderWhen Elon Musk was 17 he lived off a dollar a day for a monthto see if he had what it takes to be an entrepreneur.He explained the experiment to astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tysonin an episode of Tyson s StarTalk Radio podcast In America it s pretty easy to keep yourself alive.
So my threshold for existing was pretty low.
I figured I could be in some dingy apartment with my computer and be okay and not starve.In fact when I first came to North America I was in Canada when I was 17 and just to sort of see what it takes to live I tried to live on 1 a day which I was able to do.
You sort of just buy food in bulk at the supermarket ...
I was like Oh okay.
If I can live for a dollar a day at least from a food cost standpoint it s pretty easy to earn 30 in a month so I ll probably be okay.I decided to replicate the challenge this past month.
I adjusted for inflation 1 in 1988 when Musk was 17 is the equivalent 2 today and set aside 62 for the 31 day month of January.Musk lived off mostly hot dogs and oranges occasionally mixing in pasta and jarred tomato sauce.
I bought mostly bananas pasta and peanut butter and would switch it up with the occasional fried egg or sweet potato.I reached out to Musk after completing the challenge.
That s great although I would not encourage anyone to live on 1 a day he wrote me in an email.
That would not be super fun.
Also I did this back in 1990 so a dollar went a lot further back then.
Would be much harder to do that today.
Yes I realize he just said 1990 but I did the entire month based on the value of a 1988 dollar and I m not about to re do it ... so bear with me.
The point still stands.
Thirty one days 14 bags of pasta six jars of peanut butter and too many bananas to count later I completed the Elon Musk Challenge with 1.07 to spare.
Here s what it was like I set aside exactly 62 the evening of December 31 and established a few guidelines for the month long challenge Kathleen Elkins Business Insider1.
No office snacks.If I m emulating the lifestyle of a struggling entrepreneur I probably cannot rely on an office stocked with snacks.2.
No rollover food.I decided not to eat any food that I bought prior to January 2016.3.
I CAN accept food from other people or any freebies.I wouldn t be actively seeking out free food or asking friends and family to buy me anything the point of the challenge was not to see how much free food I could accumulate in a month but if I came across free samples or if someone outside of my office offered me a snack or meal it was fair game.4.
I can spend more than the allotted 2 on any given day.I just can t exceed the 62 over the course of the month.
Some days I would spend 8 at the grocery store for supplies that would last several days while other days I spent nothing.5.
One cup of coffee per day.For productivity reasons Ididallow myself one cup of coffee from the office Keurig machine each morning.
After struggling with caffeine headaches whilecompleting the food stamp challenge last year I learned that a cup of coffee would be essential if I wanted a chance at being productive during the work day.My strategy the first couple of days was simply to buy the cheapest food I knew of pasta and oats and eat my supplies as I got hungry.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderPictured above are the groceries from my first shopping trip at Trader Joe s.In terms of flavor for the first couple of days there was none.
I had accepted at the beginning of the challenge that everything was going to be considerably bland and I assumed I wouldn t be able to afford much more than pasta and oats.It only took one traumatizing treadmill run and a series of leg cramps to realize I would need a more concrete plan and protein if I had any chance of completing the challenge.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderI started by adding a good source of protein peanut butter to my pile of loot tortilla to accompany the peanut butter and bananas for a bit of potassium.If I were to start expanding my options beyond pasta and oats I figured I should crunch some numbers and get an idea of how much I could spend each shopping trip to ensure I wouldn t run out of money.
Once I did the math I realized just how much you can stretch 2 it s pretty incredible if you shop strategically.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderA 2.49 jar of peanut butter has 14 servings in it meaning one serving of peanut butter is just 0.18 bananas at Trader Joe s are famously 0.19 and the 3.99 bag of oats with 20 servings meant an affordable 0.20per serving.Here s the cost breakdown of the other items I bought over the course of the month Pasta 0.99 per bag 8 servings 0.12per servingTortillas 1.49 per bag 6 servings 0.25per servingSunflower seeds 1.99 per bag 14 servings 0.14per servingEggs 2.79 per dozen 12 eggs 0.23per eggButter 2.99 per box 30 servings 0.10per servingSweet potatoes 0.49per potatoGoing into the challenge I didn t have high expectations.
I reasoned that it was probably impossible but I would give it a shot last a couple weeks and write about failing.
After doing the math my perspective on the challenge changed drastically while it certainly would not be a glamorous way to eat for a month it was more than possible.Once I wrapped my head around the idea that a 2 a day food budget was possible I committed to completing the challenge which meant abandoning the wing it strategy and adopting a more calculated plan.
An integral part of the plan was rationing my goods.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderIt didn t take long to realize that one of the biggest challenges would be not blowing through my food too quickly.
I developed a dangerous routine during week one I would come home from work quite ravenous and immediately start shoveling down spoonfuls of peanut butter or cold pasta serving size being the least of my concerns.I couldn t help feeling like Matt Damon s character in The Martian while measuring out portion sizes and dividing my food up so carefully.I m a serial snacker and often eat multiple mini meals throughout the day.
One of the most challenging parts of this month would be not having the freedom to snack when I pleased.
My solution was sunflower seeds shockingly cheap at 0.14 a serving and somewhat hearty.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderI m very particular with my bananas so I stopped by Trader Joe s every three days to restock on green ones and to pick up any other supplies I was running low on.My basket was pathetically tiny and pretty much looked the same similarly colored carbs and a couple of green bananas each trip.
It s difficult to fit a healthy amount of fruits and veggies into a 2 a day budget.While I decided that calories would be more important than greens for the month it seemed important to include at least one vegetable in my diet hence the occasional 0.49 sweet potato which I integrated into the diet at the start of week three.Another challenge would be figuring out a way to make everything taste somewhat OK.
I scavenged sugar salt pepper and soy sauce packets from various spots.
My go to was 7 Eleven.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderAnother solution to the flavor conundrum was butter.
On day five I splurged on a 2.99 package of butter unsure whether or not the purchase would come back to haunt me.
Itended up being a game changer flavor wise and would last the entire month.Plus it provided a few more calories to my day to day diet and would come in handy later on in the month when I realized I could buy the occasional sweet potato and fried egg.I figured I could easily get between 1 500 and 2 000 calories per day by loading up on pasta oats and peanut butter.
It wouldn t be the most thrilling lifestyle but it started seeming more and more doable each day.
Every morning started with oatmeal Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderPictured above is my evolution of oats from completely plain on day one to slightly sweeter after adding a sugar in the raw package to quite tasty with a sugar packet and sliced banana mixed in.I made a point of using the smallest most slender spoon I could find.
This way I d be forcing myself to eat slower make the meal last and savor as much as one possibly could savor such a bland meal.I typically ate a second banana mid morning to hold me over until lunch which was usually a tortilla loaded with peanut butter.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderThe sunflower seeds held me over until dinner which was anywhere from three to five servings of pasta depending on how ravenous I felt and whether I had worked out that day.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderSurprisingly I didn t get tired of my staples.
The meals did start to feel very utilitarian a task to complete or something to check off of a list rather than an experience but I still celebrated making it to each meal and tried to appreciate and savor as much as I could.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderI predicted the monotony of eating the same things day after day would wear on me.
I even had some cheap backup food options in mind beans rice and lentils in case I got sick of pasta but I never felt the need to switch it up drastically.Here s what a typical day looked like Breakfast 1 serving of oats 1 banana 0.39 270 calories Snack 1 banana 0.19 100 calories Lunch 1 serving of tortilla 2 servings of peanut butter 0.61 500 calories Snack 1 serving of sunflower seeds 0.14 200 calories Dinner 4 servings of pasta 1 serving of butter 0.58 900 calories Total 1.91 1970 caloriesAllowing myself the occasional luxury item such as a sweet potato was key and probably the reason I never got tried of my staples.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderSweet potatoes became my new best friendduring the food stamp challenge when I discovered how flavorful satisfyingly hearty and affordable they were.I didn t have room in the budget for a potato a day but they became one of my luxury items that I ate two to three times a week starting in week three .Another luxury item I started buying during week three was eggs.
I alternated between hard boiled and fried.
This adorable frying pan helped with portion control.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderI also capitalized on the reliable food and coffee sample station at Trader Joe s to add some excitement to the month.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderI ve never appreciated bite sized portions as much as I did last month.
The cheese on the left which came from Whole Foods was particularly thrilling.
I couldn t afford to shop there but would occasionally accompany my roommate for the samples and salt packets.While I was never actively seeking free meals some very generous friends concerned about my protein and caloric intake helped out along the way.
I was treated to this fluffy omelet bowl of hearty oats and giant cup of ice cream over the course of the month.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderThe biggest distinction between the Elon Musk challenge and the food stamp challenge was my third rule Icanaccept food from other people or any freebies.The food stamp challengewas designed to raise awareness about obstacles that low income families face.
There is no guarantee people feeding themselves with SNAP benefits which average about 4 per person per day will be offered free food at any given time so you re discouraged from accepting any freebies.The Elon Musk challenge as I interpreted it is about utilizing your resources and problem solving in order to make 2 a day work.
For that reason I figured food offered to me would be fair game.An interesting dilemma I faced during the food stamp challenge was this feeling of being an outsider particularly when I would meet up with coworkers or friends at restaurants and bars only to sip on a glass of free water.
I didn t care too much about not being able to drink a beer or eat chicken tenders but it made me feel detached from the group.The few times I met up with friends this month I wasn t detached as they made sure to buy me something or share whatever they had ordered.Sure it was more than exciting to dig into a fluffy omelet or topping heavy bowl of ice cream but it didn t quite feel right.
The feeling is hard to describe but it was a mixture of guilt embarrassment and hopelessness that came from being reliant on others for money.The occasional freebies and meals from friends opened up a bit of wiggle room in the budget.
I splurged on dollar pizza one night.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderAnd stopped by McDonald s for a bag of fries one night and to snag extra salt packets for my pasta .Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderBut for the most part it was oats bananas ...Kathleen Elkins Business Insider... and pasta for the 31 days.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderAt the end of the month I had spent 60.93 on food.
I had a little over a dollar in change left over and several receipts from Trader Joe s.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderI noticed that when you have such a limited amount of money you start to handle it ever so carefully.
I kept my bills straight crisp and neatly tucked in my wallet.
Also I would often tally up my receipts and subtract the number from 62 to ensure I had the correct amount of money left.
Not once was there a discrepancy.
I couldn t afford to lose even a single penny Contrary to what I thought when first starting the challenge a 2 a day food budget is possible but far from glamorous and not the most healthy way to eat .
On the bright side I could probably make it as a boot strapped entrepreneur.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderPictured are four of the six jars of peanut butter I plowed through over the course of 31 days.A few final reflections If you put your mind to it you can do pretty much anything.After doing the math and realizing I could in fact survive on 2 a day my mind set shifted from Oh I ll just try this out and probably fail to What steps do I need to take in order for this to work Mentally committing was a huge turning point.
Once I settled it in my mind that I was going to endure the 31 days it wasn t a question of Will I fail or succeed it was a question of How exactly am I going to make this work On a broader scale completing the challenge showed me that I don t need as much money as I thought to survive.
If I ever want to pursue an entrepreneurial path this gave me the confidence that I could probably make it work.You can fit more than enough calories into 2 a day but not enough nutrients.I was shocked at how easy it was to get calories.
My typical 1.91 day provided nearly 2 000 calories Of course I was sacrificing nutrients and hearty fruits and vegetables and I probably wasn t eating enough protein.While I was a bit more sore than I normally am and woke up to several painful charley horses in general I felt alert and spry up until the last couple of days.
I did run less two to three times a week rather than my typical four to five times and if you re wondering I didn t lose any weight over the course of the month.It saved a ton of money.I m naturally stingy and don t go overboard on grocery shopping but completely eliminating restaurants and bars probably saved me over 200.On February 1 my first day post challenge I treated myself to a Shake Shack lunch.Kathleen Elkins Business InsiderPeople are curious and generous.I tried not to draw too much attention to my challenge it s extreme crazy and borderline stupidfor someone who likes to run so much.
But my coworkers and good friends who knew about the experiment were more curious and encouraging than judgmental.They wanted to knowhowI was making it work rather thanwhyI was subjecting myself to such extreme circumstances.
They also wanted to help hence the free meals and ensured that if I everactuallyfound myself with a 60 monthly food budget they would be there with a fluffy omelet or protein bar to keep me fueled.That being said it s uncomfortable having people pay for you.There was minimal wiggle room in my budget besides the dollar slice and small McDonald s fries I didn t stray from the aisles of Trader Joe s and eating out was completely out of the picture.
However as I learned from the food stamp challenge if you want to interact socialize or build relationships with people it often means eating and drinking with them.My friends were nice enough to include me in the fun and buy me meals or snacks but it s strange being completely reliant on others for money.
As thrilling as those supplemental meals were I m not sure if it was worth the feeling of guilt embarrassment and hopelessness that were part of the package.Watch the video about my Elon Musk Challenge below Kathleen ElkinsSenior Investing ReporterKathleen is a senior investing reporter at Insider covering the path to financial freedom.She started her career as an editorial intern at Business Insider in 2015 covered personal finance at CNBC Make It for four years and returned to Insider in 2021.She graduated from Williams College in 2014 and currently resides in Los Angeles.

They were my fav team as a kid.
Elon Musk elonmusk August 17 2022 If it were any team it would be Man U he posted toTwitter using a name for the club many traditional United supporters in England eschew.
Alas it was all in jest but fans who have endured too many seasons of disappointment got excited by the thought of the deep pocketed CEO rescuing their club from its creeping demise.Despised American ownerThat s because if there s a figure more universally despised by United fans than anyone else in soccer it is Joel Glazer the club s American chairman and owner of the NFL s Tampa Bay Buccaneers.He inherited ownership from his father Malcolm Glazer who acquired United in a 2005 leveraged buyout that saddled the club with a mountain of debt effectively forcing the club to pay for its own acquisition.
There s a family over there in America who are just literally letting their employees take all the hits for them and that is unforgivable vented former United player and football commentator Gary Neville following a 0 4 drubbing by lowly Brentford playing in just its second season in the Premier League.He demanded the owners stop hiding in Tampa and address the problems Joe Glazer has got to get in a plane to Manchester tomorrow and he s got to tell everybody what the hell his plan is with the football club.
By comparison Chelsea FC supporters spoke well of their Russian oligarch owner Roman Abramovich even through the Ukraine war because of all the money he pumped into the Blues to win titles.United is England s most storied side having scooped up 20 league titles one more than archrival Liverpool 13 of which were won under its totemic former manager Sir Alex Ferguson.It has seen triumph with the last second UEFA Champions League 1999 win over Bayern Munich in stoppage time and endured tragedy with the air disaster of 1958 when the side s plane crashed in Munich killing eight of England s most talented football players.Thanks to its rich and moving history the stadium at Old Trafford ranks along with Real Madrid s Bernabeu and Barcelona s Camp Nou as a pilgrimage site for football fans the world over.Hard timesYet the glory days when fans of the Red Devils were spoiled with silverware are over.With Ferguson s departure in 2013 the club slowly drifted into mediocrity churning through a seemingly never ending slew of managers.Everyone from the strict Dutch schoolmaster Louis van Gaal and United s legendary Welsh midfielder Ryan Giggs to the Special One Jos Mourinho tried their hand at coaching the side only to fall far short of expectations.Not even the return of its former star winger Cristiano Ronaldo after years of goal scoring at Real and Juventus energized the club last season.
Already he s pushing to be released from his contract in order to still qualify to compete in Europe s top competition with another team.Worse the club s once pitiful local rival Manchester City has eclipsed it thanks to the coaching skills of Pep Guardiola and the bankroll of its wealthy Emirati owner Sheikh Mansour.Now the Citizens are at the top of the table while United sits dead last and faces relegation to the dreaded second league if it doesn t improve.Fans have for years believed to know who the guilty party is the Glazers.As long as a decade ago a group of wealthy United supporters around formerGoldman Sachsbanker Jim O Neill dubbed the Red Knights sensed that the Glazers were not a safe pair of hands and attempted to wrest control of the club from the American family.That s because the family is widely viewed as locusts asset stripping the club while letting the team staff and facilities fall into a state of neglect.Daily tabloidThe Sunestimated on Tuesday that the Glazers havedrained club coffersto the tune of 1.1 billion pounds 1.3 billion in interest dividends and fees since taking control.
The only money that has been spent on players at Manchester United is the money the club has generated or that it s borrowed Neville said on the weekend.
It does not come from the families let s get this out of our heads that the Glazer family is putting money in every year like Roman Abramovich did.
Maybe Musk can be convinced to buy it in the end money is after all no problem for the world s wealthiest person especially if he can exit his 44 billion takeoverof Twitter.Even if his remark about purchasing United was just in jest he confided in April that he launched his Boring Company as a joke.Reportedly the Glazers are willing to sell.All they are asking for reportedly isjust a tenthof what Musk was prepared to pay for the social media platform.Sign up for theFortune Featuresemail list so you don t miss our biggest features exclusive interviews and investigations.Read MoreUkraine InvasionCybersecurityEnergyTravel IndustryAutosMost PopularFinanceA professional couple who make over 200 000 combined say it s hilarious to think they could afford a home in Los...April 10 2023BYAlena BotrosHealth Arcturus a highly transmissible COVID variant eyed by the WHO appears to have a new symptom.

8 2023 07 02 PMBillionaireElon Muskmade headlines in 2022 sharing on Twitter that he was going to buy the English Premier League team Manchester United.The tweet was part of an ongoing joke by Musk but came as the team is exploring sale options.
Another company that owns the New York Rangers NHL and New York Knicks NBA is also considering a partial sale of the teams.What Happened Manchester United PLC NYSE MANU went public in 2012 but remained under the control of the Glazer family who purchased the team in 2005.
For years rumors of a buyout of the team popped up including the rumor started by Elon Musk.
Although if it were any team it would be Man U.
They were my fav team as a kid Musk tweeted.While Musk didn t end up buying the team he might have inadvertently kickstarted talks of team management to explore a sale.Soccer agentJon Smithsaid in August 2022 that he believed a sale of Manchester United would happen within the next 24 months.
Soccer reportLuca Bonaititweeted the Glazers seemed more open to selling the team if they failed to qualify for the Champions League and the family had never been this open to selling before.
In November 2022 Manchester United formally announced its board of directors was exploring strategic alternatives for the club.
As part of this process the Board will consider all strategic alternatives including new investment into the club a sale or other transactions involving the company the team said.Interested parties includeJim RatcliffeandMichael Knighton.
Formula 1 driverLewis Hamiltonwas also linked with teaming up on a bid.Shares of Manchester United rose this week on new reports that high wealth individuals in Qatar were interested in buying the team.
A report from the Daily Mail said this could include a massive offer for the team as early as next week for the team which was called one of football s crown jewels.
PA Sport journalistJamie Gardnertweeted Wednesday that Qatari Sports Investments was the group interested in Manchester United.
The investment group was considering investments in other Premier League teams and might only bid for a minority stake.The deadline for bids on Manchester United by the Glazer family was reported to be mid February.New York Knicks and Rangers Join Sales Talks Along with the ongoing sale process for Manchester United another publicly traded sports team could be up for sale or at least a portion of it.In this case the sports team is actually two withMadison Square Garden Sports Corp NYSE MSGS owning both the Knicks and Rangers.MSG Sports President and COODavid Hopkinsonshare that the company was open to selling a partial stake in one or both of the legendary sports franchises according to Sportico.
We have no plan to sell either team Hopkinson said during the company s earnings call Tuesday.
No current plans there but we certainly won t rule out the possibility of selling a minority stake in the Knicks or Rangers.
Hopkinson highlighted new rules from the NBA that allowed private equity investors and sovereign wealth funds to invest in teams.Private equity company Silver Lake owns around 10 of MSG Sports and had been interested previously in owning a larger stake in the company.Why It s Important Even with shares of Manchester United up 72 in the last year the company could be undervalued compared to where a potential sale price could land.
The team was valued at 4.6 billion and 4.7 billion by Forbes and Sportico respectively.The company has a current market capitalization of 3.4 billion and an enterprise value of 4.2 billion.Reports said the Glazer family was looking for something more in the 5 billion to 7 billion range to sell the team.Benzinga previously calculated the sale range between 4.65 billion and 8.28 billion based on team valuations and multiples on recent sports team sales.The Knicks and Rangers have valuations of 6.5 billion and 2 billion from Sportico respectively.
Both team valuations include Madison Square Garden where the teams play.
This asset is owned byMadison Square Garden Entertainment Corp NYSE MSGE .There has been a limited amount of public sports teams over the years giving limited access to investors to invest in the success of teams and professional sports leagues.Two of the public sports teams could be acquired and exit stock exchanges.Coincidentally enough Ted Leonsis who owns the Washington Wizards and Washington Capitals said recently that a significant number of teams will go public in 2023 according to Sportico reporterEben Novy Williams.MANU MSGS Price Action At market close Wednesday Manchester United shares were up 10.51 to 23.34 versus a 52 week range of 10.41 to 25.24.Madison Square Garden Sports shares were up 3.82 to 188.76 versus a 52 week range of 130.61 to 188.88.Read Next Ryan Reynolds Could Be Buying This NHL Team Could Deadpool Actor Be The Latest Celebrity Team Owner Photo stockphoto mania via ShutterstockSHARE THIS POSTFACEBOOKTWITTEREMAILCOPY LINKMadison Square Garden Entertainment NewsMOREMSG Entertainment agrees to settle merger lawsuit for 48.5MSeeking Alpha5dAnalysts Opinions Are Mixed on These Services Stocks Celularity CELU and Madison Square Garden Entertainment MSGE TipRanks8dWhy Tivic Health Systems Are Trading Lower By 55 Here Are Other Stocks Moving In Thursday s Mid Day SessionBenzinga62dMGM Resorts Madison Square Garden Entertainment Cardiovascular Systems And Other Big Stocks Moving Higher On ThursdayBenzinga62dMSG Entertainment stock climbs on Q2 earnings beatSeeking Alpha62dMadison Square Garden Clocks 24 Revenue Growth In Q2 Updates On Proposed Spin Off Employee DownsizingBenzinga62dMadison Square Garden Entertainment MSGE Tops Q2 Earnings and Revenue EstimatesZacks62dMadison Square Garden Entertainment GAAP EPS of 1.95 beats by 0.81 revenue of 642.2M beats by 40.71MSeeking Alpha62dStart Trading Plus500.

And to date the EV maker isvalued at around 800 billionand is still growing.
It s pretty obvious the CEO Elon Musk knows his vehicles.
But you can t help but wonder which cars he s owned over the years.In an interview withForbes Musk revealed his first vehicle and a few others he purchased on the way.Elon Musk s claim to fameRoad trip ElonMusk s Tesla Roadster won t strike Earth anytime soon.
New research suggests the vehicle will cruise through space for tens of millions of yearshttps t.co ysQbHsYJw0 SpaceXpic.twitter.com wALPDVwzZs Scientific American sciam February 20 2018Elon Musk has made a name for himself by carving a spot in the automotive world for all electric vehicles.
Though he didn t found Tesla he put forth alarge sum of the moneyto establish the brand and get its name on the map.
He would go on to create some of the most innovative EVs.Musk started with his own company Zip2 after trying to get a job at Netscape Tech Timesreported.
He realized he was too shy to talk to other people to clinch the deal in interviews.
With no job prospects he entered the internet world with a website software company he co owned with his brother.
Later it would become known as PayPal.Eventually he found his way to designing Tesla s first vehicle the Roadster in 2008.
A decade later he sent one of these cars into space by strapping it to theSpaceX Falcon Heavy.
It s still orbiting the sun which experts say it will probably continue doing for the next few million years with a dummy nicknamed Starman at the wheel.Elon Musk s first 2 car purchasesThe first car Musk owned and liked was a 1978 BMW 320i he paid 1 400 in 1994 and fixed up himself EdwinMillerHCIThttps t.co 8SIGGP9Dnd Farzad Mostashari Farzad MD October 13 2017In 1994 Musk purchased his first car a 1978 BMW 320i that cost him 1 400.
He fixed it up to be a pretty nice looking vehicle which he drove for two years.
One day a Zip2 intern was driving it when a wheel fell off the car.
At that point Musk junked it.When he got his initial Zip2 bonus of 40 000 he went car shopping.
This time he set his sights on the one car he always wanted a Jaguar E Type.
He bought a 1967 model for 35 000.
The car was a dream come true but not for long.Musk called it a bad girlfriend because it gave him lots of trouble.
He said it kept breaking down and always needed repairs.
The first time it gave him grief was when he drove it home from the dealer he told Forbes.What other vehicles has he owned RelatedElon Musk Was Near Death After Doctors Made the Wrong DiagnosisMusk made his next car purchase after he sold Zip2.
He bought a McLaren F1 which looked like somethingout of a sci fi movie.
Musk kept the vehicle for several years and put 11 000 miles on it.
He used it as his daily driver until he gave his buddy Peter Thiel a ride in it and tried to show off.
The car hit an embankment and rolled over totaling it.
He didn t have it insured.The most interesting car Musk owned was the Lotus Esprit Submarine used in the James Bond movieThe Spy Who Loved Me.
He spent 920 000 on it at an auction but was disappointed to see it didn t transform into a submarine as it had in the movie.
So he decided that someday he would use the Tesla electric powertrain and get the Esprit to work as a submarine in the water.Elon Musk has owned a few other vehicles over the years.
He has also driven Model S and Model 3 Performance cars a Model X and the new Cybertruck which isn t slated tocome out until 2022.Tags BMWCelebritieselon muskInstagramYoutubeFacebookTwitterAbout UsContact UsCareersOwnership funding advertising infoCorrections CommitmentFact checking commitmentEthicsShowbiz Cheat SheetEndgame360Sportscasting Copyright 2023 Endgame360 Inc.

All Rights ReservedThe Truth About The First Car Elon Musk Ever OwnedNEWSTECHCARSGAMINGENTERTAINMENTSCIENCEHEALTHREVIEWSFEATURESThe Truth About The First Car Elon Musk Ever OwnedTheo Wargo Getty ImagesByKyle Encina Oct. 4 2022 10 06 am ESTBefore Elon Musk was driving Teslas he was first in an iconic yet archaic car that became quite problematic.
The Tesla CEO is known for having an eclectic taste in cars from vintage classics to modern supercars.
His passion for owning exotic sports cars only grew over the years and now he doesn t just opt for anything that s simply fast.
Rather Musk often has an eye for certain car models that stand out in a big way.
This includes celebrated beauties like the Jaguar E Type and the multimillion dollar McLaren F1.
In fact Musk even used an old automobile icon as inspirationfor his most polarizing Tesla model.
So does that mean every car he s owned was a road spectacle as well Sure if a car is significant enough Musk is willing to pay top dollar for it even if it s just a movie prop but he didn t always splurge on cars early in his career.
In fact Musk bought his first car in 1994 for a mere 1 400 viaCNBC .
The tech mogul bought an old BMW that he had to fix up himself.
Of course this wasn t just any ole Bimmer it was a 1978 BMW 320i.
Known internally as the E21 it marked the debut of the iconic 3 series.
While these cars were certainly lookers not all of them were made equal.What was Elon Musk s first car like Oskars Kupics ShutterstockThe first BMW 3 series wasn t just historical it also set standards with its driver focused angled dashboard that later became the norm in succeeding models viaBMW .
However there were numerous types of E21s produced between 1975 and 1983 base models ranged from the 316 and 318 to the more powerful 320.
The entry level BMW E21 316 featured a four cylinder engine generating 98 bhp which was more than enough at the time considering it only weighed a little over 1 000 kg viaAutoweek .
On the other hand Musk s 1978 E21 was a higher end 320i variant which was deemed a halo model given its array of upgrades.Among its various notable improvements included an independent suspension setup an improved 125 bhp and a top speed of 112 mph.
Its blend of sporty and luxury not to mention its historical significance makes the E21 quite desirable even in the modern era.
For instance an older 1977 BMW 320i was sold viaSotheby sfor almost 30 000 in 2020.
If that s the case then it certainly sounds like a car that Musk would want to be holding onto for a long time.
But did Musk even keep his first car What happened to Elon Musk s first car fireflite59 ShutterstockReliability becomes a major concern for a car that s bought over a decade after its production.
The same can be said with Musk s old BMW as it eventually showed its age within just two years of ownership.
In aYouTube video interview Musk told Forbes his 78 320i had one of its wheels literally fall off while being driven by an intern on an errand run.
Although Musk himself wasn t physically involved in the incident his first car still ended up getting scrapped afterward.
For a car that already needed repairs the moment it was bought that was bound to happen sooner or later.
It doesn t help that old BMWs like the E21 are known for showing signs of mechanical failures over time either.According toGrassroots Motorsports the 320i came with a Bosch K Jetronic Constant Injection System that is not cheap to repair and tends to cause issues over time.
Its suspension also has a tendency of being a bit unstable upon reaching speeds of 45 mph.
In addition its engine s head gaskets are prone to warping while its handbrake is notorious for becoming unresponsive after prolonged usage viaHemmings .
The E21 was a fairly reliable vehicle in its prime but there s a fine line between owning a dependable classic and a metallic death trap.
Unfortunately Musk s first BMW experience was leaning more toward the latter.
One thing is for sure the E21 definitely won t be showing up in theTesla head s opulent car collectionany time soon.Recommended

To keep the intrigue on we ve updated this list with more cars found in Elon Musk s personal collection.What might come as a surprise however is that Musk doesn t own justelectric carsinhis garage.
In fact he s quite the gearhead with some truly unique and remarkable cars he calls his own.
Here are the cars that this billionaire genius space boy and philanthropist has in his garage.121978 BMW 320i Musk s First CarBritish GQMusk s first car a 1978 BMW 320i clearly shows off his humble beginnings.
In fact back in those days a BMW wasn t quite the status symbol it is today.
Of course this car is part of history itself as it was the very first iteration of the legendary 3 Series we know and love today.He bought this car for 1 400 and fixed it up himself.
Sadly one of its wheels fell off when an intern Elon had lent it to during his time at the first company Zip2 tried turning the Bimmer.
A few minutes later the intern called up Musk to inform him of the news after which Elon decided to do away with it.111997 McLaren F1 His Celebratory Purchase And Musk s First SupercarThe iconicMcLaren F1 was Elon Musk s gift to himself.
In his own words when he sold Zip2 his first company he decided to buy an F1 which is the best car ever in the man s opinion.
Sadly Musk ended upcrashing the F1after putting over 11k miles on it as he used it quite frequently to commute from LA to San Francisco.Eventually he sold thesupercarin 2007 and that too for a profit Musk shared that the reason for selling the iconic car was that he didn t want people to always be writing about how he owns a gas guzzling high performance sports car.RELATED How Mr. Bean Crashed His McLaren F1 Twice And Still Sold It For Profit101976 Lotus Esprit Wet NellieLotus Esprit TurboTheiconic car cum submarine fromThe Spy Who Loved Me this beauty in Musk s garage had been the only functioning barely prop from the James Bond flick.

Of course like the rest of us Musk too got disappointed to find that Wet Nellie couldn t actually transform into a submarine.RELATED This Is Why Every Self Respecting Collector Should Buy A Lotus Esprit Turbo S392012 Porsche 911 Turboelferspot.comWho can blame Elon Musk for getting enamored with one of the most iconic and legendary sports cars of all time However he wasn t quite on board with the humongous gas guzzling engine owing to which he became obsessed with the idea of turning hisPorsche 911 electric.Of course the rest is history as he contacted a couple of entrepreneurs who had founded Tesla in 2003 an e car startup.
So in some ways the 911 Turboshould take the credit for leading Musk to the path that he paves today with Tesla.82010 Audi Q7 The Inspiration For The Falcon DoorsAudiThe Audi Q7 was one of the world s most luxurious SUVs in 2010 back when Musk needed a big car for his large family.
However Musk was quite vocal about his gripe with the Q7 calling it particularly horrendous.
Thus when developing his own electric SUV the Model X Musk kept in mind his problems with the Q7.
Thefalcon doors on the Model Xwere born ensuring entry into the back row of the car without having to break a sweat.RELATED Here s What Makes The 2010 Q7 The Best Audi SUV Of The Century72006 BMW M5 Tuned by HamannBring a TrailerYet again a car Musk owned in the past inspired him on one of the innovations in one of his own Tesla cars.The BMW M5 was a powerful carin itself.
However Musk went the extra step and got BMW tuning specialist Hamann to delimit the V10 upping the power to a monstrous 600 hp.In fact the beastly power that Musk obtained on his M5 alongside making it slightly wider and more aggressive is what inspired him to install the Ludicrous mode in the Tesla Model S. No wonder Musk is always obsessed with pushing his cars in terms of flat out acceleration he certainly loves pure speed.61920 Ford Model TBritish GQTheFordModel T is truly history on wheels.
Henry Ford made themost influential car of the 20th centurywhen he decided to come out with the Model T the first mass produced vehicle for the public.In fact the Model Twas a gift to Musk from a friend.
Thus it just somehow makes perfect sense that the most influential car of the 20th century gets housed in the garage of arguably the most influential carmaker of the 21st century.RELATED The Ford Model T Top Speed Vs Its Rivals5Model XTeslaApparently Musk isn t only in the business of building cars just for the world to solely enjoy.
He actively enjoys his innovations as well as his fleet of cars also includes Tesla models such as the Model X.
Notably Musk revealed this information to the world a few years back through his Twitter account.
A mid size luxury crossover EV that has been in production since 2015 Musk loves the Model X for its practicality as he uses it mainly when driving his kids.41967 E Type Jaguar RoadsterMecum AuctionsMusk revealed how he saw the Jaguar E typein a classic convertible catalog at the age of 17.
That s when he decided it would be the car he brings home if ever he could afford it.
However he also recalls how the E Type was like a bad girlfriend for him.
It kept breaking down on me Musk remembers.In fact the car even broke down on the way back home from the dealer When they bought out Zip2 the E Type Jag was what Musk bought with his 40 000 bonus from the deal.
Of course the extravagant man that he is he spent all but 5 000 from the bonus on the car itself.
Nevertheless the Roadster still calls Musk s garage its home.3Tesla Roadster The One That s Up ThereSpaceX Via Wikimedia CommonsObviously Musk owns a Tesla Roadster.
