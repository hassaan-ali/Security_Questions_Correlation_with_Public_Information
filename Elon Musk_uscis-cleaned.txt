Elon s worst trait by far in my opinion is a complete lack of loyalty or human connection.
Many of us worked tirelessly for him for years and were tossed to the curb like a piece of litter without a second thought.
Maybe it was calculated to keep the rest of the workforce on their toes and scared maybe he was just able to detach from human connection to a remarkable degree.
What was clear is that people who worked for him were like ammunition used for a specific purpose until exhausted and discarded.

It said the billionaire s town has been discussed extensively by executives at the Boring Co. Musk s tunneling and infrastructure company.The town would be built on land near two of Musk s companies in Bastrop County.Mapping Musklandia A guide to Elon Musk related activity in the Austin areaWhy Elon Musk already lives in TexasThe Boring Co. founded in California moved its headquarters to Pflugerville in recent years.
The company has been building an 80 000 square foot manufacturing and warehouse facility on a Bastrop County property where it plans to test tunneling equipment and dig as many tunnels as needed for research and development purposes according to state filings.
Currently the Boring Co. site is in unincorporated Bastrop County.SpaceX Musk s aerospace company has been building a 43 million facility with more than 500 000 square feet on a neighboring parcel.Musk said he moved to the state to be closer to his two biggest focuses Giga Texas the Tesla manufacturing site in southeastern Travis County and SpaceX s South Texas site.In addition to the Tesla Boring and SpaceX facilities Musk s neurotechnology company Neuralink is constructing an eight building lab and office space in Del Valle.Musk has also moved his private foundation to Austin.More Tesla Boring Company just the start of Elon Musk s influence in Austin analysts sayBoring Co. SpaceX and Tesla employees could live in Snailbrook Texas The Wall Street Journal report cited deed records and people familiar with the plans and said Musk has been meeting with landowners and real estate agents.
The Journal also reported that Musk and Boring Co. executives have researched and discussed incorporating a town in Bastrop County.The report said Musk envisions that employees from Boring Co. Tesla and SpaceX could live in new homes with below market rents.
It also said the Bastrop site already includes modular homes an outdoor sports area and a gym.Gapped Bass LLC an entity associated with the Boring Co. has been buying up hundreds of acresof properties in Bastrop County.
The report said the town would sit on Gapped Bass land.
According to the report which cited an advertisement last year Boring Co. employees were able to apply for two or three bedroom houses that they rented starting at about 800 a month.
If they leave the job or are fired they would need vacate within 30 days the report said.The plans are also in line with an application for a wastewater permit for the Boring Co. site about which the Statesmanreported last year.
The application mentions that the company expects up to 100 employees a day to be on the site and that the site has several warehouses and office buildings 15 on site employee housing units a recreational court and parking.
It also said plans include an on site bistro or cafe more employee housing and more parking.Some neighbors have raised concerns about the Boring Co. s Bastrop expansion plans.

Flight records show that Muskspent more time in Central Texasthan in any other place from 2021 through August 2022.The Journal report said the Bastrop plans could grow even bigger.
Boring Co. President Steve Davis has reportedly described plans that would include creating an entire city.
The report cited people familiar with the plans and text messages viewed by Journal reporters.
The report also said Davis mentioned during a company all hands meeting that there could be a future election for mayor of the city.
Under Texas law a town would need at least 201 residents to apply to be incorporated and would need approval from a county judge.Still the Boring Co. has a history of lofty plans but nationally it has just one public tunnel in Las Vegas.
In recent years the company has reached out to a number of Central Texas cities and other entities about potential tunneling projects but nothing has materialized.More Elon Musk s Boring Co. has floated idea of building tunnel from Tesla to downtown Austin Snailbrook not Elon Musk s first Texas city ideaIt s also not the first time Musk has floated the idea of a city or town in Texas.

Sarah Eckhardt D Austin who formerly represented the Bastrop area where the Boring Co. site is requested a public meeting on the permit.
That meeting will be held March 21.If the permit is granted the company would be able to dispose of 142 500 gallons of treated wastewater a day directly into the Colorado River below Lady Bird Lake according to the draft permit issued by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

He complained that it was a place of overregulation overlitigation and over taxation in late 2021 on a podcast with the satire siteThe Babylon Bee.In Texas there are fewer zoning laws and lower requirements on environmental and labour issues and it also has large areas of land which are lightly regulated.
The state also has no corporate income tax and no individual taxes on income or capital gains.The Texas plans include a private compound for Mr Musk that may be built away from the town.
People familiar with the plans said all land purchases have been personally approved by the billionaire.

He founded SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla in 2003.In 2016 he founded Neuralink and a year later he created The Boring Company.What is not so well known were his beginnings until then when as a 17 year oldtraded his native South Africa for Canadaand arranged some jobs to get ahead.Musk came to Canada where he was easily naturalized thanks to the fact that his mother Maye was born there and lived with his cousin with whom he began working on the family farm.
All this initial intrahistory of the now tycoon is told in the book Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future by Ashlee Vance.From cleaning boiler rooms to founding your first online businessThe book recounts that Musk left South Africa in part to avoid conscription which he viewed as a waste of time.
But that decision made his father refuse to pay him for college.His cousin s farm was in a town of just 400 inhabitants in the central province of Saskatchewan.
In his time Musktweeted an imageof him with 17 years on the family farm.After a while and with a desire to make money Musk asked the local employment office which jobs were the best paying.
which was cleaning the boiler room of a sawmill.
And he took the job.For 18 an hour Musk tells in the bio that he had to put on this hazmat suit and then get into this little tunnel that you barely fit in.
Then you have to shovel and you get the sand and the goo and other debris which is still smoking and you have to take it out through the same hole that you entered.
Thirty people started earlier in the week with Musk according to the book.
By the third day there were five people left.
At the end of the week Musk was left with just two more people as partners to get the job done.Musk ended up leaving manual labor and turning to technology.He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in Economics and Physics in May 1997 and then considered attending Stanford University in California for further training but never did.Zip2 Musk s first companyIt was the late 90 s and he moved to Silicon Valley toapply for a job at Netscape the download program that at the time put the music industry in check.Musk didn t get the job at Netscape.
I actually tried to hang out in the lobby de Netscape but he was too shy to talk to anyone.
So I just stood in the lobby he said.
It was pretty embarrassing he picks up the book.Despite Musk s unfavorable beginnings in the professional world his life takes a change there that is not influenced much andin 1999 he sold his first company Zip2 to Compaq for about 300 million.
Zip2 was software that provided local guides for online newspapers initially founded with the help and financial input of his brother Kimbal and Silicon Valley investors.He used the money from the sale of Zip2 to found X.com the online financial services platform that merged with Confinity in 2000 to give rise to PayPal.
In 2002 eBay bought PayPal for 1.5 billion and with that money in turn started Tesla and SpaceX.WhatsAppFacebookTwitterLinkedinShareFacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsAppPrevious articleA heroic Fuenlabrada leaves two points on the shoreNext articleCasper Ruud from 143 to eighth at the Rafa Nadal AcademyChris LawrenceChris writes Football and General Sports News on Sportsfinding.

Boiler room cleaneranatoliy gleb AdobeWhile living in British Columbia a teenage Musk visited the local unemployment office to figure out which jobs in the area paid the most.
The answer he learned was boiler room cleaner.
Starting at just 18 an hour Musk would don a hazmat suit squeeze through a narrow tunnel into the boiler room and shovel hot boiler room muck back through the tunnel into a wheelbarrow.According to Musk only he and three others out of the original crew of 30 outlasted their first week on the job.Real estate magnatemotortion AdobeMaybe magnate is a strong word but it s a fitting term for Musk and his college roommate Adeo Ressi.
The two college kids rented a cheap frat house while attending the University of Pennsylvania.
On the weekends they d change their 10 room living establishment into a bonafide speakeasy.According to Musk around 500 students would show up every weekend.
Charging them 5 at the door could bring in a nice return on investment not to mention a clever way to pay for rent after accruing more than 100 000 in student loan debt.9 Things You Must Do Before The Next RecessionCoder at Rocket Science Gamespressmaster AdobeIn the mid 90s Musk spent a little time following up on his childhood gaming passion.
As an intern at the Silicon Valley startup Rocket Science Games he started out writing basic code.
Eventually he wrote a PC multitasker using C that enabled the computer to say run a game while simultaneously reading a CD.Musk has since moved away from video game creation but he shared the credits of a few Rocket Science Games products including the games Cadillacs and Dinosaurs and Loadstar.
Intern at Pinnacle Research InstituteGorodenkoff AdobeWhile working the night shift at Rocket Science Games Musk was spending his days interning at Pinnacle Research Institute.
In a tweet Musk said that while at the institute he worked on creating and developing ruthenium tantalum supercapacitors.
Capacitors are energy storage devices that gather and store electricity and supercapacitors do so on a much larger scale than a typical capacitor.
Unsuccessful Netscape applicanttuaindeed AdobeAfter graduating from U Penn and winning an acceptance at Stanford Musk tried to score a job with Netscape an early computer services company eventually acquired by AOL.
According to Musk he applied to the company and hung out in the Netscape lobby hoping to be hired which he never was perhaps because he didn t have a computer science degree.Musk s stint as unsuccessful Netscape applicant spurred two decisions that likely had the greatest impact on his eventual billionaire status.
First he decided not to attend Stanford for a PhD after all.
Second he decided he d start his own internet based startup Zip2 to see if he could found and run a profitable company even without a PhD.9 Things You Must Do Before The Next RecessionStartup tech business founder Zip2 JenkoAtaman AdobeIn 1995 and along with his brother a friend and a 28K investment from his father Musk founded a company called Zip2.
The company effectively functioned like a web friendly version of the yellow pages it listed business addresses alongside maps that showed where each business was located.At first the business didn t seem likely to make much money.
It couldn t secure funding from investors who considered the project too risky.
Musk himself wrote the code and to save money the three founders would sleep in their rented office space.In spite of its slow beginnings the company eventually garnered enough success that it was bought by the tech company Compaq for 307 million which enabled Musk to pursue and develop more successful tech ideas.Online bank co founder X.com Studio Romantic AdobeMusk invested the money from Zip2 s sale into developing a second business the early online bank X.com.
As one of the country s early online banks X.com made email payments and other financial pay services easy.
Just a year later the company was bought by Peter Thiel s company Confinity.
Eventually the merged company became PayPal and was sold to eBay for 1.5 billion in the early 2000s.Musk made more than 150 million after taxes from the sale cementing his status as a millionaire.
In 2017 and presumably in a fit of nostalgia Musk bought back the X.com domain name from PayPal.Space travel enthusiastMoose AdobeElon Musk has always been fascinated in the idea of space travel especially in establishing human outposts on other planets.
He pursued this passion while he was still working at Confinity by attending a lecture at the Mars Society a non profit that focuses as Musk does now on getting humans to space.At the meeting Musk attended he learned about the Mars Society s focus on sending mice into orbit.
And just a year later in 2002 Musk had founded SpaceX with the intent of getting humans to the Moon Mars and beyond.

Zip2 the serial entrepreneur s first venture sold for 307 million in 1999 earning Musk 22 million for his 7 share of the company when he was only 27 years old.For most people that would be the high point of a lifetime but Musk looks back on the experience with frustration and disappointment He wanted to realize the full potential of the Internet but all he did was make himself rich.An early screenshot of Zip2Early screenshot of Zip2.Table of ContentsLaunching Zip2What s The Internet Personal Sacrifices Professional GainShow Me The MoneyWho s in Charge Here Defining Failure Continuing SuccessToggle SectionLaunching Zip2Whatever else went wrong with Zip2 Musk definitely chose the right time and place to launch the company Silicon Valley in 1995 the year the consumer Internet was born.
Musk moved to San Francisco after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania with degrees in physics and economics.
He planned to do his PhD in materials science at Stanford but a few weeks before classes started Netscape went public with a valuation of nearly 3 billion.
Musk was already aware of the business potential of Internet but now he saw that Internet companies were about to have their moment and he wanted to be part of the action.
He lasted two days at Stanford before dropping out to launch his first online venture.The way the story is usually told Musk didn t know what kind of company he wanted to create just that it should be an Internet company.
In fact he d done an internship in Silicon Valley the previous summer where he happened to hear a bungled pitch from a YellowPages sales rep for an online listing to go with the printed book.
While the rep clearly didn t know what he was talking about Musk recognized that searchable web directories were a quick and easy way to offer value online.
He began scheming with his brother Kimbal who would join him in California as his co founder and business partner about ways to capture the opportunity.Toggle SectionWhat s The Internet The first thing Musk did was purchase a local business directory for a few hundred dollars.
Next he negotiate free access to digital mapping software from a GPS company called Navteq.
From there the concept was straightforward He d simply write the necessary code and put the two databases together.
Everyone should be able to find the closest pizza place and figure out how to get there Musk liked to say.Today the utility and appeal of such a service is more than obvious but at the time the brothers had trouble convincing anyone else to believe in their idea.
The small businesses they approached didn t see the point and even venture capitalists were slow to grasp the potential.
Back in 95 there weren t very many people on the Internet and certainly nobody was making any money at all Musk said in an interview in 1999.
Most people thought the Internet was going to be a fad.
Since Musk and Kimbal weren t going to get any funding with a mere proof of concept they had to build out the company using their own capital and there wasn t much of it.
When Zip2 launched Musk only had 2 000 in the bank.
Kimbal had a bit more having recently sold his share in a College Pro Painters franchise but most of their startup costs were covered by their father Errol Musk who gave them 28 000 to get going.An early photograph of Musk and KimbalAn early photograph of Musk and KimbalToggle SectionPersonal Sacrifices Professional GainSince Musk and Kimbal barely had any money they came up with an elegant solution they hardly spent any.
When you are first starting out you really need to make your burn rate ridiculously tiny Musk said at a talk at Wharton Business School.
Don t spend more than you are sure you have.
For the two entrepreneurs applying this principle meant sleeping on futons at the office rather than renting an apartment and showering at the YMCA a few blocks away.
It was the best shape I ve ever been in Musk told a crowd at Stanford in 2003.Even after sacrificing their own living quarters they still had to keep operations extremely lean.
They shared one computer between them Musk programmed at night and turned the server on during the day.
At first the best Internet connection they could afford was through a cheap dial up modem but eventually they were able to convince an ISP startup in the office below theirs to let them plug in.
Musk drilled a hole in the wall and ran a cable down the stairwell.Once the website was up and running Musk hired three salespeople on commission.
They went door to door in malls and shopping districts to sell sponsored listings.
Slowly the money started to trickle in.
One of the benefits of keeping expenses so low is that even with a small amount of revenue the brothers were able to achieve positive cash flow early on which looked good to investors.The brother s hard work and early sales eventually earned some attention from the venture capital community in Silicon Valley which had finally clued in to the potential of the Internet.
Musk wasn t above using smoke and mirrors to impress them reports Ashlee Vance in his authoritative biography Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.
The young entrepreneur built an elaborate casement around the PC that housed the Zip2 server and stacked the whole thing on a large wheeled base to make it look like a mini supercomputer.
The trick worked and investors were suitably amazed not only by the futuristic machine but by Musk s do or die approach.
My mentality is that of a samurai.
I would rather commit seppuku than fail he told one though Musk later denied having said this .Toggle SectionShow Me The MoneyAt last Musk s big gambit paid off and in early 1996 the firm Mohr Davidow Ventures invested 3 million into the company on the condition that Musk hand over most of his shares and cede operational control to a seasoned tech executive named Rich Sorkin.
Musk was demoted to Chief Technology Officer and not surprisingly he hated to see someone else run his own business.
But he needed the money to take Zip2 to the next level so he took the deal.Under Sorkin Zip2 shifted its focus from local to national.
Instead of helping flower shops and auto dealerships stake their claim on World Wide Web Zip2 began offering a platform service to newspapers across the country so they could create their own local directory services.
The New York Times Company signed up for its first website with Zip2 along with the Chicago Tribune and big media properties like Knight Ridder and Hearst Corporation.
Craigslist hadn t yet robbed the newspapers of their classifieds cash flow but the writing was on the wall.
Media companies still had money to spend and they knew they needed to do something to avoid getting rolled under.
For a time Zip2 played the white knight to print publishing and the company grew quickly as a result.With all the new money Zip2 was finally able to hire software engineers and even poach some of the best talent in the Valley.
Musk had done most of the initial coding himself and though he was a gifted programmer his work clearly showed that he was self taught.
The new programmers found that they needed to rewrite most of the software to make it more efficient.
Musk s DIY approach to coding didn t include chunking so he inadvertently created a hairball a tangled mess of code that s nearly impossible to unravel if anything goes wrong.Toggle SectionWho s in Charge Here But Musk didn t always agree with the changes and he had a bad habit of returning the favor.
Often he would re write his programmers code after they left work at the end of the day without telling them of the changes.
He was also prone to micro managing and rudely criticizing his team.
Needless to say they found him difficult to work with.
Musk never stopped himself from bluntly correcting others when he thought they were wrong.
As a child this alienating habit earned him the unwanted attention of school bullies.
In his first company he won the begrudging respect of his employees but not much affection.His lack of social delicacy definitely impacted his working relationships at Zip2 but mostly importantly with Sorkin whom Musk accused of mismanaging the company.
Although the money coming from media partners had made Zip2 very profitable Musk felt that Sorkin s strategy had compromised the company s potential to reach consumers directly.
To Musk they were helping the old guard defend against Internet encroachment rather than making the Internet more exciting and impactful for users.In 1998 three years after Musk arrived in Silicon Valley Sorkin tried to merge Zip2 with CitySearch a comparable service with more national reach.
Musk assented to the deal initially but later rebelled.
He organized a coup to have Sorkin ousted and himself reinstated as CEO.
The plan worked at first and Sorkin was dropped but it quickly backfired when Zip2 s board turned around and sold the company to Compaq which was trying to beef up its AltaVista web portal.
Musk never even considered sticking around he was ready for the next thing.Toggle SectionDefining Failure Continuing SuccessMusk often says that he never expected any of his ventures to be successful including Zip2.
But like many other Silicon Valley entrepreneurs his willingness to take risks is a major point of pride.
To repeat one of his most often quoted sayings Failure is an option here.
If things are not failing you are not innovating enough.
Still failure isn t sweet.
At an awards ceremony in 2011 Musk spoke briefly about his time at Zip2 in a tone of self reproach.
I was very naive and much stupider than I am now.
I wish I could go back and give myself a slap on my face.
He added I was trying to make up for my mistakes by working really really hard.
Musk didn t clarify which mistakes he was referring to but in Vance s book he shared some of his regrets about his poor leadership and communication style.
Even if they would like to behave like you they don t necessarily have all the assumptions or information that you have in your mind Musk said speaking of his employees and colleagues.
You have to put yourself in a position where you say Well how would this sound knowing what they know Whatever the lessons Zip2 gave Musk everything he needed to start his next company the financial capital but more importantly the frustrated sense of disappointment at how things had worked out and an urgent desire to do it better next time.
Musk took his share of the sale and bought himself a new home and a Maclaren F1 the fastest car in the world at the time and a decent symbol for Musk s approach to life.
The rest he invested in his next venture X.com which ultimately became PayPal.Get new articles in your email.Join our newsletter and be notified when we publish new articles and reviews Email Related Articles Average Customer Support Response Times For SaaS CompaniesI emailed 52 SaaS companies to test support time.

Brown AFP Getty ImagesElon Musk is best known as the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX but way before his success in Silicon Valley he worked odd jobs to get by.At 17 Musk left his home in South Africa and headed to Canada where he became a citizen hismother Maye was born there and stayed with his cousin according to the book Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future by Ashlee Vance.At first Musk worked at his cousin s farm in Waldeck Saskatchewan a village that as of 2016 had a population offewer than 300 people tending to vegetables and shoveling grain bins according to the book Elon Musk.
Elon Musk tweet here picture of him at 17 years old on his cousin s farm.Then Musk learned to cut logs with a chainsaw in Vancouver British Columbia according to the book.However after asking at the unemployment office what jobs paid the best Musk took on his hardest gig yet cleaning out the boiler room of a lumber mill.For 18 an hour Musk said in the biography that he had to put on this hazmat suit and then shimmy through this little tunnel that you can barely fit in.
Then you have to shovel and you take the sand and goop and other residue which is still steaming hot and you have to shovel it through the same hole you came in through.
There is no escape Musk said.
Someone else on the other side has to shovel it into a wheelbarrow.
If you stay in there for more than 30 minutes you get too hot and die.
Thirty people started out at the beginning of the week with Musk according to the book.
By the third day five people were left.
By the end of the week Musk was left with only two other people to do the work.Musk eventually gave up manual labor and pursued tech.
Hegraduated from the University of Pennsylvaniain May of 1997 and then debated attending Stanford University in California for its Material Science Engineering graduate program.
Though Musk never enrolled in classes at Stanford although he was admitted he did venture to Silicon Valley and applied for a job at Netscape.
He was interested in the then nascent internet he told entrepreneur and investorKevin Rosein 2012.Musk didn t get the job at Netscape.
He had a guess for why he didn t land it He had a degree from Wharton and was accepted to do graduate school work in physical and materials science but he didn t have a computer science degree nor several years under his belt working at a software company.
I actually tried hanging out in the Netscape lobby but I was too shy to talk to anyone.
So I m just like standing in the lobby he said.
It was pretty embarrassing.
Despite Musk s inauspicious start in the professional world in 1999he sold his first company Zip2 to Compaq for roughly 300 million.
He started Zip2 after his experience applying to Netscape deciding that instead of pursing a PhD at Stanford he would first try to start a company.
Musk said he figured he could always return to education if starting a business did not work out.He used the money from the Zip2 sale to found X.com an online financial services platform that merged with Confinity in 2000 and later became PayPal.
In 2002 eBay purchased PayPal for 1.5 billion.Musk went on to start SpaceX in 2002 followed by Tesla in 2003.
In 2016 he founded Neuralink and a year later he created The Boring Company.Today Elon Musk is worth 27.5 billion according to Forbes.Like this story Subscribe to CNBC Make It on YouTube Don t miss Elon Musk ran a nightclub out of his college frat house to make money for rentThe central question that inspired all of Elon Musk s businessesVIDEO1 0301 03Elon Musk remembers the SpaceX of 10 years ago We couldn t even reach orbit with little Falcon 1 Make ItStay in the loopGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inboxSign UpAbout UsLearn more about the world of CNBC Make ItLearn MoreFollow UsCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel 2023CNBC LLC.

The Pathole said Musk sent his resume tried hanging out in their lobby but he was too shy to talk to anyone.
So he started his own Internet company Zip2 as he wasn t able to get a job anywhere Pathole added.Musk confirmed the story with the one clarification that he could get a job just not at an internet company weren t many back then .
Musk s reply received over 60 000 likes and 1 000 comments including one user who supportively said moral of the story You gotta be shy to have a huge success while another added Now I bet they wish they hired you.
ELON MUSK S TESLA AUTOPILOT AND SAFETY CLAIMS NOT IRON CLADMusk s run with Zip2 lasted for four years after computer company Compaq proceeded to purchase the technology company for roughly 305 million in 1999.
Following the Zip2 acquisition Musk co founded PayPal which was acquired by eBay in July 2002 for 1.5 billion.
He then founded SpaceX in 2002 which nearly went bankrupt trying to get off the ground.
A lot of people really only heard of SpaceX relatively recently they may think Falcon 9 and Dragon just instantly appeared and that s how it always was.
But it wasn t Musk told theInternational Astronautical Congress IAC conference in Adelaide Australia in 2017.
I messed up the first three launches.
The first three launches failed.
And fortunately the fourth launch which was that was the last money that we had for Falcon 1 that fourth launch worked.
Or it would have been that would have been it for SpaceX.
But fate liked us that day.
So the fourth launch worked.
Since then SpaceX has reached a valuation of roughly 74 billion according to reports.
In addition to the development of SpaceX s Starship prototype whichwill be used by NASA to bring astronauts back to the Moonand is expected to bring the first passengers to Mars as early as 2026 the aerospace company is planning to launch a global satellite internet service called Starlink which is expected to offer global coverage sometime next year.In addition SpaceX s Falcon 9 rocket willtransport the NASA s Crew 2 team to the International Space Stationon Thursday and help launch theworld s first all civilian mission to orbit Earth Inspiration4 in the fourth quarter of 2021.
The company has also lined up space tourism partnerships withSpace Adventures in 2021andAxiom Space in 2022 and will conductthe first ever private commercial space trip to the Moon dubbed dearMoon in 2023.TESLA OWNERS DUB APRIL 20 ELON MUSK DAY In 2004 Musk invested 6.3 million in startup Tesla Motors according toWired.
However like SpaceX the company had tofight to avoid going bankruptby securing an additional 40 million in funding in 2008.
That funding round completed 6pm on Christmas Eve in 2008.
Last hour of last day possible as investors were leaving town that night we were 3 days away from bankruptcy Musk tweeted in November.
I put in all money I had didn t own a house had to borrow money from friends to pay rent.
Difficult time.
He acknowledged in a separate tweets that it would ve been certain death for Tesla had he not invested everything that he had and that even with the additional funding the electric automaker wasnearly a month away from bankruptcywhen it first brought the Model S to production.But Tesla persevered and went public in 2010 and since then the company s shares have seen a meteoric rise with the stock up more than 700 in the past year alone.TickerSecurityLastChangeChange TSLATESLA INC.186.79 2.28 1.24 Now the electric vehicle manufacturer is working onits second Gigafactory in Austin Texas which will be used to produce Tesla s Cybertruck pickup and serve as an additional U.S. manufacturing site for the company s Model Y small SUV largely for distribution to the East Coast.
In its latest quarter Tesladelivered nearly 185 000 vehicles citing a strong reception for its latest Model Y S and X vehicles.CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSIn addition to Netscape Pathole revealed in a tweet last week that Musk worked at a Palo Alto video game company where he wrote a multitasker for PC in C which could basically read video from a CD while running a game at the same time.
The name of that videogame company was Rocket Science Pathole added.
Fate loves irony.
True.
Ancient times Musk replied.
Had to flip CPU registers explicitly as computer was so slow.
Today Musksits at the top of Forbes annual Billionaire list trailing only behind Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.

At age 30 he founded SpaceX.
At age 41 he oversaw the first cargo mission to the International Space Station by a private company.
And at age 12 as a kid living in South Africa he made a space themed PC game calledBlastar.
Now thanks to the power of the internet you can play that game.Musk sold the code for Blastar for 500 to the magazinePC and Office Technology and a reproduction of the page it appeared on was published in Ashlee Vance s biographyElon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.
From there Tomas Lloret Llinares a software engineer at Google took the code and rebuilt the game to work in HTML5.Your mission as the game s lonely space pilot is to destroy the alien freighter carrying deadly hydrogen bombs and status beam machines.
Blastaris mostly a mix ofSpace InvadersandAsteroid though it s much more basic.
There is never more than two ships on the screen there are few sound effects and like many games of its time it really has no ending.

I m not buying any sports teams.
Elon Musk elonmusk August 17 2022Although if it were any team it would be Man U.
They were my fav team as a kid.
Elon Musk elonmusk August 17 2022 If it were any team it would be Man U he posted toTwitter using a name for the club many traditional United supporters in England eschew.
Alas it was all in jest but fans who have endured too many seasons of disappointment got excited by the thought of the deep pocketed CEO rescuing their club from its creeping demise.Despised American ownerThat s because if there s a figure more universally despised by United fans than anyone else in soccer it is Joel Glazer the club s American chairman and owner of the NFL s Tampa Bay Buccaneers.He inherited ownership from his father Malcolm Glazer who acquired United in a 2005 leveraged buyout that saddled the club with a mountain of debt effectively forcing the club to pay for its own acquisition.
There s a family over there in America who are just literally letting their employees take all the hits for them and that is unforgivable vented former United player and football commentator Gary Neville following a 0 4 drubbing by lowly Brentford playing in just its second season in the Premier League.He demanded the owners stop hiding in Tampa and address the problems Joe Glazer has got to get in a plane to Manchester tomorrow and he s got to tell everybody what the hell his plan is with the football club.
By comparison Chelsea FC supporters spoke well of their Russian oligarch owner Roman Abramovich even through the Ukraine war because of all the money he pumped into the Blues to win titles.United is England s most storied side having scooped up 20 league titles one more than archrival Liverpool 13 of which were won under its totemic former manager Sir Alex Ferguson.It has seen triumph with the last second UEFA Champions League 1999 win over Bayern Munich in stoppage time and endured tragedy with the air disaster of 1958 when the side s plane crashed in Munich killing eight of England s most talented football players.Thanks to its rich and moving history the stadium at Old Trafford ranks along with Real Madrid s Bernabeu and Barcelona s Camp Nou as a pilgrimage site for football fans the world over.Hard timesYet the glory days when fans of the Red Devils were spoiled with silverware are over.With Ferguson s departure in 2013 the club slowly drifted into mediocrity churning through a seemingly never ending slew of managers.Everyone from the strict Dutch schoolmaster Louis van Gaal and United s legendary Welsh midfielder Ryan Giggs to the Special One Jos Mourinho tried their hand at coaching the side only to fall far short of expectations.Not even the return of its former star winger Cristiano Ronaldo after years of goal scoring at Real and Juventus energized the club last season.
Already he s pushing to be released from his contract in order to still qualify to compete in Europe s top competition with another team.Worse the club s once pitiful local rival Manchester City has eclipsed it thanks to the coaching skills of Pep Guardiola and the bankroll of its wealthy Emirati owner Sheikh Mansour.Now the Citizens are at the top of the table while United sits dead last and faces relegation to the dreaded second league if it doesn t improve.Fans have for years believed to know who the guilty party is the Glazers.As long as a decade ago a group of wealthy United supporters around formerGoldman Sachsbanker Jim O Neill dubbed the Red Knights sensed that the Glazers were not a safe pair of hands and attempted to wrest control of the club from the American family.That s because the family is widely viewed as locusts asset stripping the club while letting the team staff and facilities fall into a state of neglect.Daily tabloidThe Sunestimated on Tuesday that the Glazers havedrained club coffersto the tune of 1.1 billion pounds 1.3 billion in interest dividends and fees since taking control.
The only money that has been spent on players at Manchester United is the money the club has generated or that it s borrowed Neville said on the weekend.
It does not come from the families let s get this out of our heads that the Glazer family is putting money in every year like Roman Abramovich did.
Maybe Musk can be convinced to buy it in the end money is after all no problem for the world s wealthiest person especially if he can exit his 44 billion takeoverof Twitter.Even if his remark about purchasing United was just in jest he confided in April that he launched his Boring Company as a joke.Reportedly the Glazers are willing to sell.All they are asking for reportedly isjust a tenthof what Musk was prepared to pay for the social media platform.Sign up for theFortune Featuresemail list so you don t miss our biggest features exclusive interviews and investigations.Read MoreUkraine InvasionCybersecurityEnergyTravel IndustryAutosMost PopularFinanceA professional couple who make over 200 000 combined say it s hilarious to think they could afford a home in Los...April 10 2023BYAlena BotrosHealth Arcturus a highly transmissible COVID variant eyed by the WHO appears to have a new symptom.

Part of the reason maybethereason I got interested in tech was video games Musk said.
I probably wouldn t have started programming if it wasn t for video games or wouldn t have been as interested in computers and tech if it wasn t for video games.
I think video games are a very powerful force for getting young kids interested in technology it has way bigger knock on effects than people may realize.
Elon Musk multimillionaire rocket scientist Tesla and Space X founder at his desk March 19 2004 in Los Angeles.Paul Harris Getty ImagesMusk speaks from experience.
At just 12 years old he coded and published a space fighting game called Blastar which latersold for 500to trade publication PC and Office Technology magazine.
He once worked at a gaming startup Which weirdly was called Rocket Science fate loves irony Musk has joked .
And though hismore recent birthdaysmay have been spent pulling all nighters at Tesla Musk once celebrated his birthday by asking for a life size statue of Vault Boy the fictional mascot character fromvideo game Fallout.But Musk isn t the only one who has found inspiration and success through gaming.
The link between the two is obvious when he interviews his future employees.Participants sit at computer monitors to play video games at the 2018 DreamHack video gaming festival on January 27 2018 in Leipzig Germany.Jens Schlueter Getty Images If we re interviewing somebody for a software engineering role at Tesla or SpaceX many times we ll ask How d you start programming Musk says.
I think many of the best software engineers in the world are at or spent much of their career at video game houses Musk says emphasizing how problem solving in video games transfers over to problem solving in software engineering.
If people had to try to create incredibly realistic graphics using very little computer power it s a hard problem so a lot of people had to write really tight code and come up with really clever ideas to do that.
For Musk s team at Tesla the enhanced graphics in video games enable them to better simulate self driving cars with the help of artificial intelligence.
Hetasks his simulation team with creating a photorealistic world of what he says are some of the most boring things skid marks on the road concrete curves shadows and faded street lines.
These simulations have been essential to the development ofautopilot cars which are scheduled for afull rollout next year.He also credited video gameCyberpunk as well as the movie Blade Runner as the inspiration for theTesla pickup truck.A sketch of a Tesla pickup truck concept revealed at the firm s Semi truck and Roadster event in Hawthorne California on November 16 2017.Tesla It definitely doesn t look like a normal car it looks like it should not be on the roads like it came out of a movie or something Musk says.
It won t appeal to everyone but it ll be something that s different.
I think I would buy it.
Musk wasn t just at E3 to talk about his new pickup truck.
He announced the addition ofvideo games to Tesla vehicles drivers can play games on the car s center screen while docked at a charging station.
He even hinted at developing games for his space capsules going to Mars.
My experience is if you re trying to figure out what others love but you don t love it it s really hard to make that great he says.
So when you work on something if you fall in love with it that s a good sign and then don t worry about if others do.
If you do others will.

And I was like Well you re supporting a young capitalist.
And the reality is if you don t buy it from me you re not going to get one and I know you can afford 10.
2.
He was bulliedMusk has been open about his difficult childhood discussing it most recently in last Sunday s 60 Minutes interview.
While he attended grade school in Pretoria South Africa Musk was not only theyoungest and smallest kid in his class but he was nerdier and muchmore into booksthan manyjocks at school.In Ashlee Vance s 2015 book Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future Musk said gangs of boys at would sometimes hunt him down going so far as to push him down a flight of stairs in one instance and send him to the hospital.
I was almost beaten to death he addedon 60 Minutes.
The bullying continueduntil he was 15 years old when went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself by doing karate judo and wrestling.
By 16 he said he was dishing it out as hard as they d give it to me.
3.
His parents thought he was deafMusk was so introspective as a kid that his parents and doctors ordered tests to check if he was deaf.
His mother Maye Musk eventually learned this was his way of daydreaming about his inventions.
He goes into his brain and then you just see he is in another world.
He still does that.
Now I just leave him be because I know he is designing a new rocket or something recalled Maye Musk in Vance s book.Though this bothered his peers who could reportedly yell at him and do jumping jacks beside him and he wouldn t notice Musk s pensive moments allowed him to visualize projects he d hope to tackle.4.

According to Musk she was mainly there to make sure he didn t break anything.VIDEO1 5701 57The one trait that Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have in commonThe Definitive Guide to Business She wasn t like watching me.
I was off making explosives and reading books and building rockets and doing things that could have gotten me killed said Musk.
I m shocked that I have all my fingers.

He had a penchant for readingThroughout his childhood books played a crucial role in fueling Musk s ambitions and entertaining him.Said Musk I was raised by books.
Books and then my parents.
He reportedly read the entire Encyclopedia Britannicaat age nineand would pore over science fiction novels comics and nonfiction books for up to 10 hours a day.
Some of themost influential books he readincluded The Lord of the Rings The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and Isaac Asimov s Foundation series.6.
He coded his own video game at 12 and got 500 for itIn the early days of computer coding a 12 year old Musk built a Blastar a science fiction inspired space game.
Similar to the classic Space Invaders arcade game the objective in Blastar was to destroy an alien spacecraft carrying deadly bombs.Although he s since called it atrivial game Blastar earned Musk an easy 500 after a South African trade publication published its source code.7.

They got as far as signing a lease setting contracts together filling out forms at the city planning department.
But their plans were foiled when the city told them they were too young to get a real estate permit without an adult to sign off.According to Kimbal both his father and uncle flipped out when they brought up their arcade plans.9.
He moved to North America as a teenagerOnce Elon reached his teens he moved from his native South Africa tobegin his college studiesin North America.
At 17 he first emigrated to see what it takes to live he told Neil DeGrasse Tysonon StarTalk Radio.
Musk found that in America it s pretty easy to keep yourself alive.
Given that his threshold for existing was pretty low Musk was determined to survive on 1 a day by buying food at the supermarket in bulk.
I went more for the hotdogs and oranges you do get really tired of hot dogs and oranges after a while said Musk.
mixing things up every now and then with some pasta and green pepper and a big thing of sauce which he said could go pretty far too.

As work on the project progressed SpaceX gradually bought up most of Boca Chica s three dozen homes though a few homeowners held out according to reports.
Creating the city of Starbase Texas Musktweeted in March 2021.
From thence to Mars.
And hence the stars.
Starbase he added would encompass an area much larger than Boca Chica.
SpaceX reportedly bought out the homes of numerous residents of Boca Chica where Musk built his SpaceX rocket launch facility.REUTERS It was a little neighborhood and Elon Musk came and took it over Mary Helen Flores a teacher from nearby Brownsville told The Sunday Times.
He renamed it Starbase without asking anyone.
He just announced it on Twitter.
Maria Pointer who used to live in the last house in Texas before the border told the paper that her home is now being used by SpaceX to store medical supplies.She could still point out her old home as it stands juxtaposed to Starbase s massive rocket assembly towers.In 2012 Musk received bids from states and territories that wanted to host a new SpaceX base with Florida and Puerto Rico being the two leading candidates before Musk settled on Boca Chica after meeting with Texas officials according to The Sunday Times.SpaceX ignites 31 out of 33 raptor engines during a Starship booster static fire test at Starbase on Feb. 9.AP He picked Texas because it s a dirty red state where no one s going to care what he does in a poor border town Flores told the paper.Flores said she knew when I saw them putting the launchpad right behind the dune line that it was going to be a disaster for our beach.
He has destroyed a pristine paradise in the name of saving animals Come on she said dismissing the world s richest man as just a delusional billionaire.
They are destroying an ecosystem that has been there for hundreds of years Flores added.She said she s seen several fires and a lot of sea turtle deaths following repeated launches and multipleexplosions at the site.Musk has defended the Boca Chica site as necessary for the future of humankind.AFP via Getty ImagesEarlier this month SpaceXfired up31 of 33 heavy booster engines on the world s largest rocket ever built at Starbase.Musk whose plans to expand Starbase have reportedly beenput on hold has defended the site as necessary for the survival of humankind.
Something could go wrong on Earth he said at an event on the Starbase launchpad last year according to The Sunday Times.
We are life s guardians he said.
The creatures that we love they can t build spaceships but we can bring them with us.
A spectator watches a SpaceX test launch near Boca Chica with binoculars earlier this month.APIn March 2021 Muskclaimedthat Starbase s population will grow by several thousand people over the next year or two as the company headquartered in Hawthorne California expands its workforce.To sweeten the deal for prospective residents and local officials Muskpledgedto donate 20 million to schools in Cameron County which is home to the Boca Chica.He also said he d give 10 million toward downtown revitalization in Brownsville where about 29 percent of the population lives in poverty.Share this article FacebookTwitterFlipboardWhatsAppEmailCopyFiled underelon muskrocketsspacespacextexas2 18 23Read NextTwitter to charge users to secure accounts via text messag...Top ConcertsGet seats.

Its residents are divided on his vision for SpaceX but their opinion may not matter at all.Anna KramerJuly 28 2021In Boca Chica Texas the coastal prairie stretches to the horizon on either side of the Gulf of Mexico an endless sandbar topped with floating greenery wheeling gulls and whipping gusts of wind.Far above the sea on a foggy March day the camera feed on the Starship jerked and then froze on an image of orange flames shooting into the gray.
From the ground below onlookers strained to see through the opaque sky.
After a moment of quiet jagged edges of steel started to rain from the clouds battering the ground near the oceanside launch pad ripping through the dunes sinking deep into the sand and flats.Yet again a SpaceX rocket had exploded in a test flight over the empty miles of Boca Chica beach.
For the people of Cameron County and the nearby city of Brownsville the March explosion was the most apocalyptic of several in early 2021.
For Elon Musk and SpaceX it was a normal testing snafu in the necessary process to build a prototype for a rocket that they hope one day will carry 100 people to Mars.
A high production rate solves many ills Musk tweeted at the time.
At least the crater is in the right place SpaceX never replied to Protocol s numerous requests for comment on this story.The single 20 mile stretch of road to the beach was closed on March 30 the day of the explosion.
When the road reopened the space fanatics who d flocked to the launch facility at the southernmost tip of Texas swarmed down past the launch pad and over the dunes searching for their own little memento a piece of rocket debris.
People circled back around from the beach and climbed over the dunes said Stephanie Bilodeau a conservation biologist who walks the dunes and coastal prairie for her research almost every other day.
We had sheltered from the heat and wind in the front seat of her white pickup.
In the back her little dog panted quietly nestled among the gear Bilodeau uses to count and tag the rare red knots and plovers that nest at the edge of the 91 000 acre wildlife refuge.
On one side of our perch the view stretched unbroken to the ocean on the other side the horizon was blocked by newly constructed letters taller than us that proclaimed we d entered STARBASE.
For SpaceX cleaning up the debris wasn t a simple matter of loading it onto trucks and driving back to the facility.
Driving heavy trucks out onto the flats and ripping out the chunks of steel would only cause more damage.
The company had to come up with a way to cut the wreckage into smaller lighter pieces to remove it.The company ultimately completed most of the cleanup but researchers like Bilodeau who work in the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge and the local Cameron County residents were furious.
The explosion had at least temporarily destroyed the delicate ecosystem in the area near the launch.
Bilodeau had seen plovers nesting near the launch pad the week before and now they were gone.
A local entomologist was devastated by the destruction posed to the invertebrates that sustain the ecosystem.
In certain areas steel had sunk into the sand every couple of feet.For Cameron County and Brownsville Musk s money is a bit like his rockets.
The Starship prototype was a gleaming vision for the future of space exploration but its explosion was devastating to the natural environment.
Musk s determination to build a spaceport and town that will one day launch hundreds of people to Mars has brought with it the promise of jobs economic revitalization and an influx of wealth to one of the poorest and least connected places in America.
But the investment will also bring wealthy outsiders to a culturally vibrant family oriented border town that is proud of its history and the people who ve lived there for generations a town full of people skeptical that the money and prestige Musk is offering might be anything more than a poison pill.SpaceX s investment likely does mean a change in economic status and power for Brownsville.
But the money and vision of the world s second richest man could also upend the culture and values that make Brownsville special to its community a fear that has riven the people of this usually quiet place.Market Square was built in 1850.
Photo Ver nica G. C rdenas for ProtocolFrom afar only electricity and cars signal that Brownsville hasn t been plucked from the early 20th century.
The old stables yellow brick stucco painted general store signs the occasional colonnade and elaborately wrought balcony all echo with a kind of faded glory.
The ghosts of a place that was home to Spanish colonizers the last battle of the Civil War and generations of Mexican immigrants remain in the still standing architecture.Up close the picture is a different one.
The abandoned downtown storefronts with dusty off kilter wigs and broken glass convey the decades since almost anyone could afford to own a local business the long nearby highway with strip malls pawn shops and dried out palm trees suggest the tax dollars are slim.
Despite its historic charm Brownsville is one of the poorest urban areas in the United States.But statistics on relative poverty and a blighted downtown don t capture the realities of life for the people who grew up there.
Resacas long forgotten meanders of the Rio Grande glimmer in the sun behind houses and cut through the local parks.
The bridge to Matamoros Mexico lingers in the backdrop of daily life symbolizing both literal and metaphorical ties between Brownsville and its sister city across the Rio Grande.
For years teenagers from Mexico would bike across the bridge to the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley campus that stretches along one side of the city.
The Main Street Deli glitzed up with twinkly lights ice cream and gleaming booths in the middle of downtown is the place to see and be seen.
Across the block Dodici Pizza and Wine is one of a few facades oozing polish and charm on the otherwise rough street.
Co owned by Brownsville Mayor Trey Mendez it s the place the locals go if they want to support the mayor or at least seem like they do.When Mendez moved back home to Brownsville to help deal with a family crisis in the mid 2000s he was just like many other locals a kid who came back after leaving for a better education.
In Brownsville he built himself a law firm joined the historical preservation society and co founded Dodici s. When he decided to run for mayor in 2019 SpaceX was still nothing more than a big name company settling down 30 minutes outside of town an interesting but largely irrelevant industrial experiment.
His campaign mostly pledged to increase public safety and battle Brownsville s reputation as a place that couldn t move past its economic plight.When he s photographed Mendez is almost always wearing a pale collared shirt and slim fit pants.
The day he shakes my hand in City Hall he looks the mirror image of almost every picture he s ever taken.
A few years ago people always talked about the potential.
Brownsville could be a good city he said leaning back into the pale leather couch in his sunlit office always smiling at least a little bit.The kids working at the local coffee shops said the same.
When I was young it felt like a small town with nothing to do one told me.
We always wanted to drive away.
Trey Mendez mayor of Brownsville poses in front of his law offices.Photo Ver nica G. C rdenas for ProtocolMendez won the mayoral election by promising to change that perception.
But his power to make that happen was nothing compared to the force that was building just 20 miles down the road almost completely out of his control.
Engineers from Florida and California were filling up Brownsville hotels.
Trucks loaded with cement and building materials were chugging out of town toward the beach.
Just four months after Mendez won the election Musk hosted an event at the still fairly small SpaceX facility.
It was the local population s first real chance to see what had been quietly built on their beach and Musk s signal to the world that for the first time SpaceX was planning to get publicly aggressive about pursuing its efforts to build a spaceport to Mars.Mendez seemed surprised to be asked whether he feels the pressure of being one of the few people with the ability to stand up to all the money and power that comes with SpaceX.
No.
Nah.
I guess some people are just built differently he said.This story doesn t really start in 2012 when SpaceX first started to scope out sites in South Texas for a launch facility.
Nor does it start in 2014 when the company received approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for about 12 Falcon Heavy launches the rockets used to launch low earth orbit satellites .
And not in 2016 when the first tracking antenna was built near Boca Chica Village.It really starts the moment Musk got up on a stage at the SpaceX facility to introduce the locals to Starship in 2019.
The wind gusted into the microphone the stage was aglow with spotlights.
It s windy out here Musk shouted into the microphone.
The crowd cheered as the billionaire grinned turning into the wind to let his black blazer flap open.It could have been a rock concert except there has never been a concert in the middle of the national wildlife refuge on the southernmost tip of Texas.
Musk could be the pop star except never before had someone of his wealth and acclaim visited the undeveloped beach on the Gulf of Mexico.
Behind him hulking into the night sky glittering steel in a straight shot toward the heavens rested the Starship prototype.
It s quite windy here.
It s tied down well though Muskshouted into the crowd.The gleaming steel was just an early prototype of a rocket that should one day house 100 crew members but to Musk it was a symbol of promise.At some point in 2018 without consulting local government leaders SpaceX quietly switched course.
Instead of launching its Falcon rockets the company decided to use the South Texas facility for a longer term project to build both the Starship and the Super Heavy booster that Musk hopes will one day serve as the main transport vehicle for people to live on Mars.
Getting people to live on Mars entails years and likely even decades of rocket prototypes and launch tests and likely more explosions over the wildlife refuge.
All of those rockets require new fuel energy and water supplies.
The tech necessary to make this happen means SpaceX has to hire hundreds and even thousands of top tier engineers from the best schools and companies in the country who will want houses like the ones they could have had in Florida or California and good schools for their kids.
Space ambitions of this scale always end up reshaping the place they re located see NASA in Cape Canaveral and Houston .Starship prototypes are seen near the SpaceX facilities.Photo Ver nica G. C rdenas for ProtocolWhen SpaceX changed its plans Musk only really had to share details with one partner the FAA.
While the Texas state government has some say over how public land is used all other space and rocket related activities in the U.S. are monitored only by the FAA meaning that Cameron County doesn t have official power to tell SpaceX to do or stop much of anything.
In November 2016 we were aware that SpaceX was committed to Falcon heavy launches once a month for satellites and that was the extent of it said county Judge Eddie Trevi o Jr.
In 2017 2019 Elon changed gears.
Instead of doing Falcon 9 he started developing Starship.
It was not anticipated.
Trevi o a former Brownsville mayor and a local kid like Mendez exudes the kind of warmth power and confidence you d expect of a successful small town Texas politician.
He likes to talk football.
He s direct.
He s not afraid of Musk but he also knows he s under an immense amount of pressure to represent the needs and desires of people who are now passively watching their lives be transformed by Musk s choices.
His role as county judge is an administrative position that positions him as a mayor for everyone who lives in the parts of Cameron County outside the Brownsville city limits.SpaceX is creeping higher into the sky and farther up the road almost daily.Musk s presentation that night in 2019 was part of SpaceX s effort to make the people of Cameron County feel that they were invited on the Mars bound space train that had practically speaking left the station years ago.
We re faced with a choice Which future do we want Musk asked the crowd that night.
Are we going to be in many worlds and out among the stars or in one where we are forever confined to earth And I say it is the first and I hope you agree with me.
Like Mendez Trevi o has little choice in what SpaceX will or will not do in Cameron County.
The best he can do is play Musk s game and hope he wins.
Sometimes lots of money can leave destruction and waste in its path.
This business is a dangerous business he said.
But lots of money also means more than 1 500 jobs for skilled tradesmen that didn t exist before many of whom would otherwise leave Brownsville to find work and the potential for many more jobs on top of those.
Some of Trevi o s constituents are thrilled about the higher wages that let them stay closer to home others are terrified to see a California billionaire taking over the place they see as their birthright.
I have to get this right because there are so many diverging interests on this project both for and against he said.
If we re not getting everything we want but getting some of what we want it needs to be better than what we had before.
I m trying to help SpaceX get what they want not have SpaceX create a blueprint for damaging Cameron County.
Eddie Trevi o Jr. county judge poses in a courtroom at the Cameron County Courthouse.Photo Ver nica G. C rdenas for ProtocolThe domed buildings the rocket and the cranes on the launch pad are the only structures that break the horizon on the single road from Brownsville to Boca Chica Beach.
The complex of rapidly growing structures alongside the boulevard would suit a new dystopian sci fi franchise perfectly all gray white and pointed steel.
Security gates prevent drivers from turning even into the parking lot and guards in tactical gear wait to escort those who might happen to slip through not so politely back to the road.
Condominiums and the massive STARBASE sign stretching hundreds of feet down the previously untouched road sprung up over the last few months.
The construction has continued so fast that Google Maps can t keep up with the changes.
SpaceX is creeping higher into the sky and farther up the road almost daily.Just past the facility on the road to the beach sits the turnoff to the tiny Boca Chica Village where a handful of homeowners still live.
SpaceXhas drawn national attention for making life difficultfor the people who remain there and for trying to force out the residents who refused buyouts.
The once small beach village essentially a Brownsville outpost isnow a deeply unpleasant placeto live for some residents and will only grow more dangerous as SpaceX expands.
One of the small houses left in the village owned by SpaceX is now Musk s primary residence he spends most of his time there and has sold or is in the process of selling all of his other properties .Beyond the turnoff to the village the beach road passes within a few hundred feet of the launch pad and rocket separated only by a low wall and some fencing.
On one sweltering sunny Wednesday in May Susan Eade and Victor DeAnda Jr. are picking up trash along the dunes with their dog they go out every week to do the same thing collecting plastic bottles and rocket debris alike.A Boca Chica Village Welcomes You sign on the road leading to the Boca Chica Village neighborhood where existing homes and Airstream trailers house SpaceX employees including Elon Musk.Photos Ver nica G. C rdenas for ProtocolEade recently came back to live in Brownsville after more than 45 years away only to find little change except for a massive construction project on the beach.
She s furious that the company is building in the middle of the wildlife refuge.
Even if it was three or four miles down the beach ...
It s the middle of a wildlife refuge she said.
Who allowed that Bilodeau who works for the Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries Program spends long days walking the beach and flats along the road searching for red knot and plover nests.
At first glance it looks like a big desolate area.
It doesn t look like much to anybody she said.
But tidal flats and coastal prairie the water is wind driven you can t find an area like this.
I don t even know how to describe how amazing this place is for birds.
Because the birds nest on the ground their future in the refuge will likely depend on how much SpaceX expands in the area and the size of future rocket tests.
The prototype Starship uses three engines but the final Super Heavy booster for the Starship rocket willone day use more than 30 which could mean far larger explosions than the one that savaged the beach in March.
And SpaceX plans to grow far beyond just its rocket.
The company wants to expand its solar farm and parking lots and build a natural gas pretreatment facility a desalination plant and a power plant in addition to more towers support buildings and other assorted structures.Bilodeau s nonprofit isn t the only group upset about the harm already caused by the project.
The environmental approvals that originally allowed construction to begin in 2016 were based on the plan to launch a limited number of Falcon rockets.
When Musk announced the change in 2018 no serious reassessment was done.
In 2019 the FAA then issued a written re evaluation to its original approval saying it believed the Starship tests would meet the same environmental criteria as the previous approval.
Only in late 2020 did the FAA announce that it would begin a new environmental review of the Starship and Super Heavy plans all while SpaceX charged ahead with its Starship testing and spaceport construction.
When the FAA asked for public comments to shape the new research a flood of critiques from researchers and locals over the habitat and natural environment flooded in.A National Wildlife Refuge sign is near the SpaceX facilities in Boca Chica Village where pelicans fly over its launch pad facilities.Photos Ver nica G. C rdenas for ProtocolThe local Brownsville residents are worried about more than the wildlife refuge.
SpaceX closes the road to the beach often and unexpectedly infuriating them.
Many see the beach as part of their Brownsville birthright it s the place they tell everyone to visit the place they grew up playing the place where the Rio Grande opens into the Gulf of Mexico Boca Chica means little mouth.
It s still open to the public but it doesn t feel like it Bilodeau said from the perch on the side of the road we d picked just in case access was blocked that afternoon.One local nonprofit called Save RGV says that the roadshave been closed more than 380 hours so far just in 2021 a number far above the 300 hours of road closures the company has permission to use in all of 2021. Who gave him permission to take over our beaches DeAnda Jr. asked me the next day.Because the birds nest on the ground their future in the refuge will likely depend on how much SpaceX expands in the area and the size of future rocket tests.The road closures aren t all that s making the locals angry theongoing construction of a new rocket assembly integration tower at the facility never received any approvals.
The FAA could force SpaceX to tear down the tower if it violates the new environmental review underway but Musk has a reputation for doing whatever he feels needs to be done regardless of the government.
He resents the regulatory and government officials that try to slow his work and he hates plans and designs that take a long time to develop If it s long it s wrong.
If it s tight it s right he s known for saying.It s not just the tower or the road closures.
Cameron County District Attorney Luis Saenzis accusing the SpaceX armed security guardsof preventing the public from turning down two small roads near the complex that legally are not private property.
The roads are county property but they ve been renamed built over and closed off by SpaceX guards the same guards that turned me away during my visits to the complex.
This was my favorite place to work before all of this happened.
Every time it s more stressful Bilodeau said.
I think a lot of people have just stopped coming here.
Sometimes I am just like is this a lost cause The March day the rocket exploded over the beach was also the day nearly everyone in Brownsville realized that SpaceX would become a part of their personal future.Just a few weeks earlier Musk had tweeted that he wanted to turn Boca Chica Beach and Village into an incorporated town called Starbase.
Trevi o doesn t think a proposal for a proper town has much potential juice building real infrastructure like water systems and gas lines would be incredibly difficult in the remote location especially given the environmental restrictions.
They haven t done the logistics.
The main problem they are going to face is lack of infrastructure he said.
But SpaceX can likely persuade the United States Postal Service to grant the area its own zip code which will let everyone put Starbase on the mailing address.
He can call it Starbase but for everyone who was born and raised down there that is Boca Chica.
It s one of the last pristine undeveloped beaches Trevi o said.The drive from SpaceX to the Main Street Deli is 24 miles but Musk s presence lingers in the local gossip as if his Tesla is always parked around the corner.
For many of the older locals he s bringing the kind of change to their peaceful beach town that they never wanted to see.
For the high school girls working the counter at the deli in the last year there had been so much change so quickly that for the first time they don t feel the desperate need to get out at the first possible chance.
I don t know how things will be a year from now.
Things are changing so fast.
It s so exciting one of them told me.24 hours after the rocket explosion Musk tweeted that he would be gifting 30 million to Brownsville 10 million would go to revitalize the downtown area and another 20 million to the county school district.The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley UTRGV Stargate building in the SpaceX facilities.Photo Ver nica G. C rdenas for ProtocolThe news caused an absolute sensation driving locals further into their pro and anti SpaceX camps.
The town s local Twitter feed was bombarded with angry people furious that Brownsville was letting itself be bought by a billionaire.
I ve never seen a city kiss ass on this level one resident wrote.
Imagine how much good would come to our people if Elon Musk actually paid taxes wrote another.Mendez wasn t exactly ready with a quick answer for the angry or the excited The news of the gift had come as a complete surprise.
Mendez hasn t even ever met Musk and the donation didn t come with an invitation to change that.Mendez is not the kind of man to let that bother him.
He explained that he s a lawyer and a businessman.
He s eager for the potential that comes with SpaceX s growth.
It s what you do with that he said.
Brownsville could be a good city.
It s grown way more than I could have anticipated.
It s an opportunity to take advantage of what we have in Brownsville.
Really be accommodating.
He s sanguine about Brownsville becoming a space town.
What they want for Brownsville and what I want for Brownsville are the same thing to make it a place where people want to live.
But many of the people who grew up and stayed in the town all of their lives resent the idea that Brownsville isn t already a good place to live.
Sure the desolate shopfronts and buildings reduced to rubble aren t exactly pleasant to look at but a good life is more than a couple of empty buildings.
Whenever you see a rocket explode it s a concern.
They tell us that you should be so grateful that Elon Musk chose you all.
But are we Jackie a local artist asked.
This is trying to turn Brownsville into something it s not.
How do you do this without getting rid of all the people who can barely afford to live here How are we supposed to trust Musk when he already broke the rules by the beach I wish they would answer our questions.
I thought we were supposed to vote DeAnda Jr. the man who picks up trash with Eade every week asked.
Sure there are some concerns.
I m not going to say there aren t concerns Mendez said.
But as far as the community goes it s not just the higher wages it raises everyone.
Whenever you grow so quickly like this it becomes difficult to plan for.
For people already here I don t see why they won t be able to afford it.
He cited two new efforts to build affordable housing in the downtown area and then changed the subject back to the potential for positive growth.
We lose a lot of good people to other cities.
We re trying to build a city they want to come back to he said.Eade vacillates between anger and hope.
I can see both sides of it.
I came back after 45 years and Brownsville is just the same.
No revitalization at all.
I hope they do something good with the money she said.Businesses in downtown Brownsville.
Photo Ver nica G. C rdenas for ProtocolOne month after the explosion and Musk s surprise financial gift what felt like half of Brownsville descended on an old stable a few blocks north of City Hall.
The wide cement ground floor usually empty was filled with paintings of rockets and crowded with chattering people.
The stairs to the second floor of the newly opened Livery Gallery led to more photos in the wide window lit space capturing the Starship s evolution from that fateful night in 2019 to the explosion at the end of March all taken by local amateur photographers.
Presiding over it all the painted face of Musk grinned into the distance on the neighboring building his head larger than the people crowded underneath him.
BOCA CHICA TO MARS proclaimed the letters atop his hair.People fixed Starbase stickers to their phone cases and took selfies with Musk s face.
The art gallery opening was a smashing success.
The events of the previous two months had made SpaceX important to more than just the local enthusiasts everyone in town wanted to see and understand what the company was doing.And when it ended the mural remained suddenly an iconic destination.
The painting was originally nothing more than an accident the gallery owner never even approved the design and now it is one of the must see sites in downtown Brownsville surrounded by and on top of abandoned storefronts.
Boca Chica to Mars is now one of those phrases that will linger as part of the city s identity.
When Musk chose Cameron County he changed its future irrevocably even if it was at first an accident.
Trevi o doesn t wish he could turn back the clock.
I m not going to doubt Elon or his goal or his motivation.
If it creates jobs that should be something that we are all wanting he said.And Mendez He loves what s happened.
He and his city government have fully embraced the idea that from now on Brownsville should be a space town the next Houston or Cape Canaveral.Mendez s government has done some small practical things to create the space industry vibe like persuading the Space Channel to relocate to the city from California and helping venture capitalists establish ties to local space startups.
The town is situated in one of the few geographical places on Earth ideal for rocket launches about 750 miles from the Blue Origin launch site in West Texas but similarly situated relative to the equator meaning SpaceX is not the only rocket company interested in setting up shop.
We are getting a lot of interest from space companies Mendez said.
We re well positioned globally for the science of rockets and launching so it s up to us to really be able to sell the city and sell to the community.
Brownsville also has a shiny new airport empty except for customs equipment and security machines still wrapped in plastic anticipating an influx of workers and tourists.
SpaceX has promised to donate one of the Starship rocket wings for an airport monument and the road that wraps around it has been renamed Starship Road.The children growing up in Brownsville and Cameron County today are growing up surrounded by space.
Driving down to watch the SpaceX launches may be the biggest events they ll ever witness.
Many of their toys are space themed.
Their high school field trips and extracurriculars will involve partnerships with SpaceX.
When they talk about space in school you can drive the kids to the launch area.
They get to see it in front of their eyes one local mother said.SpaceX facilities.Photo Ver nica G. C rdenas for ProtocolHundreds of engineers have been recruited to live in Boca Chica and the surrounding area.
Florida and California natives have filled up the hotels and bought up all of the local properties pushing property values up.
Commercial lots near the SpaceX facility have more than doubled in value over the last few years.The FAA s upcoming environmental review might require the company to make some contingency plans for the harms it could cause to the local environment and community but Musk has proven he has little interest in letting his project slow down.
Angry locals have no real recourse or power and most of them don t know that almost all of the authority to stop Musk rests with state and government agencies not their local officials.
To me it feels silly.
It just feels like a waste of time.
We should just focus on fixing our planet a bit more Bilodeau said.
Why are we focusing on sending people to Mars But stepping off the tiny plane from Dallas you can smell the inevitable change in the upturned soil across the airport and hear it in the squeaking of sneakers across gleaming new floors.
Walking into the airport to leave the last thing you see is the sign proclaiming Starship Road.

I think at one point I thought inventing stuff or creating things would be a cool thing to do.
But I wasn t really sure if that meant starting a company or whether that meant working for a company that made cool stuff Musk told Rose.VIDEO1 0501 05Elon Musk reveals his plan to send passengers anywhere on Earth in under 60 minutes for the price of a plane ticketMake ItMusk moved to Silicon Valley to attend Stanford University graduate school.
He tried and failed to get a job at Netscape Communications the company that created the first web browser Netscape Navigator.
In 95 I kinda thought the Internet would be something that would change the world in a major way and I wanted to be a part of it.
Actually what I first tried to do was I tried to get a job at Netscape.
I wouldn t actually try to start a company I d try to get a job at Netscape he told Rose.He even took to hanging around the Netscape lobby hoping to get a job there.
I didn t get any reply.
I mean I had a physics and economics degree or physics and business degree from Wharton and I was doing grad studies in applied physics and materials science.
I guess that...
I mean I didn t have a computer science degree or several years working at a software company he tells Rose.
For whatever reason I didn t get a reply from Netscape and I actually tried hanging out in the lobby but I was too shy to talk to anyone.
So I m just like standing in the lobby.
I was just sort of standing there trying to see if there s someone I could talk to and then I just couldn t I couldn t I was too scared to talk to anyone.
So then I left.
Musk left Stanford to start Zip2 which was founded in1996 according to Crunchbase.Zip2.
1996 I was just writing software that summer and it got to the start of the quarter for Stanford and I had to make a decision so I decided to go on deferment.
I figured if I start a company and it doesn t work then I can always go back to grad school Musk told Rose.
So I talked to the chairman of the department and he let me go on deferment and I said I d probably be back in six months and he said he was probably never going to hear from me again and he was correct.
I ve never spoken to him since.
Zip2 aimed to bring media companies to the internet he told Rose.
The initial idea was to create software that could help bring the media companies online.
So we helped in a small way bring companies like New York Times Hearst Knight Ridder and so forth bring them online.
They weren t actually always online people don t realize that Musk told Rose in 2012.Saturday Musk Tweeted about his work at Zip2.At Zip2 I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps calculating point to point directions anywhere in US first ever company to do so as well as white pages business listings w reviews an early Yelp .
Also wrote V1 of classifieds autotrading real estate apps.Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional city papers online for the first time and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times Boston Globe Knight Ridder websites.
NYT KR Hearst were all major investors in Zip2.According to Musk his work with Zip2 in the 1990s is the reason he understands the way newsrooms work now.
Musk has gone on tweet stormscriticizing the mediarecently one of which attractedanti semitic rhetoric andsaid he wants to launch a platform to rate the credibility of journalists which he plans to call Pravduh.
Pravda means truth in Russian.This is why I m not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked then I d know everything s fine no need for a media credibility rating system like PravduhAt the end of May Musk tweeted that he had bought the domain name Pravduh.com.Problem solved was able to buy http Pravduh.com Game on Musk also droppedcryptic clues in Marchthat he was launching an intergalactic media empire called Thud for which he reportedly tapped editors from The Onion.As for Zip2 Compaq boughtthe company in 1999.
Musk said that at the time he had to choose between buying a house and a sports car with his windfall.
Heopted for the sportscar he tweeted.19 years ago when my 1st company got bought I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 best car ever imo .
Was no contest.
I bought F1 a small condo that was much cheaper than the car.
New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way Musk wrecked that car a McLaren F1 in 2000 while driving with his PayPal co founder Peter Thiel he revealed in a2012 interview with PandoDaily.
Peter said So what can this do and like probably No.
1 on the list of famous last words I said Watch this.
So I floored it and did a lane change on Sand Hill said Musk referring to the famous Silicon Valley road.
We hit an embankment like a 45 degree embankment on Sand Hill which tossed the car into the air like a discus and it kept rotating with about three foot of air clearance.
Saturday s tweets from Musk about his early years came after he revealed some details about a SpaceX version of the Tesla supercar the Roadster.SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include 10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car.
These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration top speed braking cornering.
Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly While the idea of a rocket powered Tesla may feel like a joke Musk insists he is serious.See also Elon Musk s mom worked 5 jobs at once as she struggled to raise 3 kids after her divorceElon Musk I think I do have like an issue with uh time Elon Musk is stressed says he s sleeping on Tesla factory floor and has no time to go home and showerVIDEO1 0201 02Elon Musk s brother says this is how you raise entrepreneurial kidsMake It VoicesLike this story LikeCNBC Make It on FacebookStay in the loopGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inboxSign UpAbout UsLearn more about the world of CNBC Make ItLearn MoreFollow UsCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel 2023CNBC LLC.

Andrew Kelly Reuters ByCNN CNN.comMarch 10 2023 at 5 15 a.m.By Clare Duffy CNNWhat do you get for the billionaire who has everything Perhaps his own town.Entities connected to Elon Musk and his companies have reportedly been acquiring thousands of acres of land in Texas with the hope of starting a town where his employees could live and work according to areportfrom the Wall Street Journal Thursday.These entities have purchased at least 3 500 acres near Austin and are in the process of working toward incorporating a town called Snailbrook an apparent reference to the mascot of Musk s tunneling firm the Boring Company according to the Journal.The report cites county deeds and other land records as well as city and county emails internal company communications state licensing records and interviews with land owners and city and county officials.
By building out a company town of his own Musk could take that approach even further.According to the report Musk wants employees at his companies Boring Co. Tesla and SpaceX all of which have major production facilities near Austin to be able to live in new homes with below market rents.
The Snailbrook effort also reportedly includes plans to build more than 100 homes as well as neighborhood features such as a pool and outdoor sports area.Incorporating a town might also give Musk who has been known to clash with state and federal regulators more say over how things are run.Musk in 2020announcedhe would move Tesla s headquarters and his personal residence from California to Texas blaming frustrations with California s coronavirus related restrictions.
Musk s SpaceX and Boring Co. also have facilities in Texas and Boring Co. has reportedly been in talks with Austin about the possibility of building tunnels in the city according to aFebruary reportfrom the Austin American Statesman.Related ArticlesBusiness Silicon Valley VC firm raises 1.2 billion to find and fund the next Elon MuskBusiness Twitter becomes X Corp as Elon Musk advances everything app hopesBusiness Opinion An AI moratorium is not the answer to the technology s threatsBusiness Tech layoffs raise new alarms about how platforms protect usersBusiness Editorial Tech must craft AI safety protocols forget naive call for pauseProperty records for Bastrop County which is adjacent to Austin show that the Boring Co. owns 11 parcels of land on one address near the Colorado River where mobile homes were built over the past three years according to records reviewed by CNN.

I frankly don t want to be theCEOof any company he had said adding At SpaceX it s really that I m responsible for the engineering of the rockets andTeslafor the technology in the car that makes it successful.
So CEO is often viewed as somewhat of a business focused role but in reality my role is much more that of an engineer developing technology and making sure that we develop breakthrough technologies and that we have a team of incredible engineers who can achieve those goals.

Elon Musk Created A Private School For His Kids Now It s Been Shut DownTheThingsTrendingCelebrityTV ShowsReality TVMoviesLifestyleCelebrityTV ShowsNetflixReality TVMoviesFashionMoreInterviewsMusicJoin Our TeamAdvertise with usWrite For UsHomeContact UsTermsPrivacyCopyrightAbout UsPress KitFact Checking PolicyCorrections PolicyEthics PolicyOwnership PolicyCopyright 2023 www.thethings.comHomeCelebrityElon Musk Created A Private School For His Kids Now It s Been Shut DownByShireen HollierPublished Jul 2 2022Elon Musk is no longer tied to the private school he created and it s changed drastically from his original concept.In 2014 Elon Musk started a school.
Named Ad Astra which in Latin means To the stars it was housed inside one of SpaceX s factories in Hawthorne California.We can all be forgiven for thinking it sounded like something out of a sci fi movie.That s whatTheWashington Postcalled Ad Astra.
And there s merit in their label.
At the time the school was operating with two full time teachers and only nine students five of whom were Musk s children Twins Griffin and Xavier born in 2004 and triplets Damien Saxon and Kai born two years later.The Washington Postarticle also called Ad Astra A secretive laboratory school for brilliant kids who love flamethrowers.
Other epithets applied to the Ad Astra school in a variety of publications include Mysterious Innovative and even Disruptive.
Musk Is Famously Skeptical Of Traditional EducationThe space tycoon was educated at a boy s school in South Africa and has often talked about how he wasbullied there something which has affected many celebrities.Musk is also vocal in his dislike of the traditional American school system.
He wanted to make sure his children would have a better school experience than he had.RELATED 16 Little Known Facts About Elon Musk s ChildrenIt was while his 5 sons were attending Mirman school in Los Angeles a private K 8 school for gifted children that the Tesla founder decided to pull them from the traditional school system.
As he said the skills to create the future aren t taught in school.
In fact Musk s thinking was that a major change was needed in education one which would enable students to be able to jobs in the future that doesn t exist today.
He has also seen a need for education that included showing students how to interact and work alongside robots a skill he says will be needed in the decades to come.
Because he notes humans are underrated but working with tech is a must.Elon Musk s School Had No CurriculumIn 2014 the Tesla co founder approached one of his son s Mirman teachers Josh Dahn to create an unconventional school that would offer an alternative type of schooling.
Musk s only directive around the design of the school was to make it great.
There were nolimitations on any mandated structure or curriculum.RELATED What Elon Musk s Kids Really Think About Their Controversial DadThe school funded by Musk featured no math music or sports lessons.
Rather according toThe Daily Beast students would work together on complex projects.
There were also no foreign language lessons offered based on Musk s philosophy that real time translation software will be available in the future making the need for learning different languages obsolete.Admission Was Exclusive... And Not Long LivedEntry into Ad Astra included a number of problems that prospective students had to complete in order to apply.
One of these featured a typical Musk twist Applicants had to select from a list of 11 fictional planets and choose which three would be best and which three were the worst options for a new human colony.With no term marks exciting problems solved in groups and subjects like robotics the whole concept was based on the idea of producing unique people not factory workers.RELATED These Huge Stars Were Once Expelled From SchoolThe revelry wouldn t last long though in May 2022 Josh Dahn the school s co founder announced that Ad Astra had changed.
Referring to the first school as an eight year experiment that served 50 students he introduced Astra Nova meaning New Star as an online school.Elon Musk s New School Model Is Online Only...The old school was completely free to students with Musk picking up the tab at a cost of 475 000 per year but the new Astra Nova is a traditional for profit business.
Students will pay 7 500 per year but classes only take place on Thursdays.The main difference between the two schools is that classes will now be offered online.
Astra Nova will accept applications from students across the world between the ages of 8 and 14.
In situ classes are only offered at home base in California students in other parts of the world interact together in live team games.Musk s Critics are saying the online option is a little incongruous given his recent ruling that Tesla employees are no longer allowed to work from home since the lifting of Covid restrictions.
It follows hiscontroversial 2020 move to keep the Tesla factory open amid mandatory closure.In June 2022 he issued an email that said employees had to show up for at least 40 hours a week in the main Tesla office.
It read Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth.
This will not happen by phoning it in.
Similar emails were sent to SpaceX.Musk Is No Longer Connected To The Running Of The SchoolAstra Nova founder Josh Dahn is quick to point out that Musk is no longer connected to the school.
Other than his initial assistance and funding Dahn has been running operations along with a specially selected staff.Students interested in attending the new online school have to submit a video response to a set problem.
The first of these under the title The Lake Conundrum looks at issues around manufacturing water contamination and pollution plus the added complication of corrupt bosses.As with the initial school it s futuristic.Perhaps it s best to end off with a message to prospective students from Josh Dahn which reads So I humbly welcome you to Astra Nova School an eight year experiment that has been the challenge and joy of my life.
Ad Astra was the school at SpaceX that served 50 students Astra Nova is the online school that aims to reach millions by sharing the insights from our work.

In his view regular school wasn t educating his kids the way he thought it should.
They weren t doing the things I thought should be done Musk said during the interview.
I thought well let s see what we can do.
Maybe creating a school would be better.
Musk hired one of the teachers from the boys school to help found Ad Astra and the school now teaches 14 elementary school aged kids from mostly SpaceX employees families.
The CEO wanted his school to teach according to students individual aptitudes so he did away with the grade structure entirely.
Most importantly he says learning should be about problem solving.
It s important to teach problem solving or teach to the problem and not the tools.
It s important to teach problem solving or teach to the problem and not the tools Musk said.
Let s say you re trying to teach people about how engines work.
A more traditional approach would be saying We re going to teach all about screwdrivers and wrenches.
This is a very difficult way to do it.
A much better way would be like Here s the engine.
Now let s take it apart.
How are we gonna take it apart Oh you need a screwdriver Right now the school is small and experimental and Musk is unsure about how long his children will be enrolled.

Arstechnicarevealedthis week.
Musk started the school after pulling all of his sons out of Los Angeles private schools and hired one of his son s teachers to act as its principal.
And in true Musk fashion it s nothing like a school you went to.According to the Ars report the kids work together in teams and explore non traditional topics including robotics and how to handle artificial intelligence that could ultimately turn evil.
There are no grades given to students at the school and if the children don t like a particular class they re taking they can simply opt out.
Ars found that there are fewer than 40 students at the school including Musk s own kids.
The other students are children of SpaceX employees and other people from the Los Angeles area.Not surprisingly the school seems to focus its education on STEM.
But unlike other schools it doesn t teach music and sports and language arts appear to be an afterthought according to Ars.
The reason Musk thinks it s more important for children to learn other topics when computers can take up the task of translating language in the future.In the place of traditional education is a class that discusses the ethical and political woes of artificial intelligence a topic that Musk is deeply concerned about.
Students are also asked to make a variety of technologies like robots and even weather balloons.
And when students asked to make electromagnetic pulse technology the school graciously accepted Ars wrote.For now Ad Astra is only available to students between the ages of 7 and 14.
And since two of Musk s sons are leaving for traditional high schools next year there s some concern over what the future of the school looks like according to Ars.
But if anything is clear it s that Ad Astra is appealing to some.According to Ars approximately 400 families last year vied for just 12 open spots at Musk s school.Subscribe to Well Adjusted our newsletter full of simple strategies to work smarter and live better from the Fortune Well team.Sign up today.Read MoreArtificial IntelligenceCryptocurrencyMetaverseCybersecurityTech ForwardMost PopularFinanceA professional couple who make over 200 000 combined say it s hilarious to think they could afford a home in Los...April 10 2023BYAlena BotrosHealth Arcturus a highly transmissible COVID variant eyed by the WHO appears to have a new symptom.

It is also the perfect name for the self described mysterious and disruptive school he started.ByRick Gonzales Published1 year agoRelated Kanye West Says His New Private School Will Turn Kids Into GeniusesIn Latin Ad Astra means toward the stars which is the perfect description of how the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX Elon Musk views life.
It is also the perfect name for the self described mysterious and disruptive school he started.On a number of occasions Elon Musk has criticized America seducational systembut instead of continuing to make complaints he s doing something about it.
In 2014 the billionaire philanthropist put his money where his Twitter fingers were and came up with Ad Astra.
Ad Astra is an innovative school with its own system in place one that Musk says allows kids in based on their aptitudes.
Indeed there are no qualifications instead of treating the school as an assembly line I think it makes more sense to attend to education to match your skills and student abilities Musk said in a 2015 interview that took place in Beijing China.
While describing Ad Astra s educational model he said it would focus on skills.
He touched on three things The school would be an alternative to age segregation.
One thing Musk doesn t agree with in America s educational system is the separation of children based on age.
He feels it doesn t make sense for children as they have different interests and abilities that are not defined by age.Problem solving would be the focus.
Musk feels that children should be taught how to solve problems instead of giving them their tools in a vacuum.Gamification.
Musk sees games that children play in a different light.
He says he never has to encourage his kids to play games and that games are the natural way to educate children.Elon Musk created this school for his five boys twins Griffin and Xavier and triplets Damian Saxon and Kai.
He also has a sixth boy X AE A XII Musk good luck with that pronunciation who comes from his former relationship with Canadian singer Grimes Claire Boucher .X AE A XII Musk is waiting in the wings to join the Ad Astra when old enough.Elon Musk s school was created by Musk and Joshua Dahn a former teacher at the prestigiousMirman School for Gifted Childrenin Beverly Hills California.
Their first iteration of the Ad Astra school was small consisting of 8 kids.
The location was also small located in a conference room at SpaceX.Elon Musk s school soon grew to 20 students and presently they are at 40 students.
The students range in ages from 7 to 14 but are never separated by these ages.
They are taught to work together as teams regardless of age.At first Elon Musk opened up his school to his children and some children of SpaceX employees.
It was never said which employees were offered this opportunity for their children how many of them or under what conditions would apply.The subjects at Elon Musk s school as you may imagine are quite different than what the normal educational system promotes and teaches.
The students study applied science Artificial Intelligence design and coding with a heavy influence on the creation of robots.What you will not see at Ad Astra are students involved in sports learning foreign languages or even music.
Musk no longer feels it s necessary to learn a foreign language in school because real time translation software is becoming more popular and developed.So what brought Elon Musk to the decision to create this specialized school As mentioned the American education system was a big turn off for the billionaire but it does go deeper.
I hated going to school when I was little it was torture says Musk.
He also confessed that he wasbulliedtremendously in school as a child growing up in South Africa.Though Elon Musk has now moved to Texas the Ad Astra school remains at the California SpaceXfacility.
Obtaining information about the school or trying to get in might be more difficult than winning the lotto.

They are not concerned about what the school is like how many teachers it has or how it works information that you normally want to know before choosing your children s school.
Only that it is about Elon Musk said Simon viaEntrepreneur.Don t plan on the school growing much more than the present 40 students.

Musk also hired one of Mirman s teachers Joshua Dahn to run Ad Astra.
In the new school s first year the Musk children twins born in 2004 and triplets born in 2006 made up more than half of the student body the rest were all children of SpaceX employees according to Ars Technica.The school has since expanded.
Today more than 30 students aged 7 to 14 including the Musk children take part in a curriculum heavy on science math engineering robotics and artificial intelligence.
Virtually everything about Ad Astra is unconventional from its grades there aren t any to the secrecy of its admissions process.
Reportedly spots were limited to the children of SpaceX employees and even then were invitation only.
I ve heard from various SpaceX families that they have tried and failed to get information about the school even though they were told it was a benefit during the interview Christina Simon co author ofBeyond the Brochure An Insider s Guide to Private Elementary Schools in Los Angeles told the Hollywood Reporter.It seems things have changed.
In June the school s website consisted of only a logo and email address.
A recent visitto the siteshows links to a password protected portal for current parents and to admission information for the coming school year.Advertisement Our admissions process is designed to identify students and families that could most significantly contribute to the creativity and diversity of our small school the site reads.
Students must be between the ages of 8 and 13 and while candidates already living in Los Angeles are strongly preferred those from elsewhere will be considered.
Quartz has contacted Ad Astra for comment and will update this post with any response.
Applicants must fill out a basic information form which asks if any of the applicant s parents work for SpaceX Tesla or Boring Company three of Musk s companies an optional parent statement an example of a project or endeavor that shows the student s commitment ambition and originality and the student s answer to one of three synthesis questions.The problems posed in these questions are all very Muskian.
In the first called Goldilocks prospective students are presented with descriptions of 11 fictional planets and asked to identify the best three choices and worst three choices for a new human colony.
Leaving Earth ASAP is famously a top Musk priority.
An excerpt of the prompt for the Goldilocks question on the Ad Astra School application.Image Ad Astra SchoolAdvertisement The Eleventh Painting presents a scenario in which a lost work by a fictional famous and dead painter is discovered during construction in her home town in Mexico.
When alive the artist had stipulated that any sales of her work be used for children s arts education.
Applicants who choose to respond to this synthesis question are presented with five prospective buyers offering vastly different amounts of money and public access to the work they need to rank the potential buyers from best to worst.In The Lake students are given a description of an environmental catastrophe at a local lake and asked to apportion the amount of blame among six parties involved scientists politicians voters the media the polluter and a shadowy figure known as the puppetmaster who is described as a wealthy individual who is afraid that new regulations could affect their business empire.
Applications are due Jan. 1.
Selected students will be invited to tour the school and to undergo subsequent rounds of interviews.
The school will make its final admissions decisions in March 2019.Unsuccessful candidates may still be able to recreate the Ad Astra experience at home inan interview withentrepreneur Peter Diamandishighlighted by Ars Technica Dahn said the school will offer its curriculum online for free to applicants not given a spot whose parents are willing to have their children be home schooled.AdvertisementThere are downsides to entrusting your children s education to the whims of a mercurial billionaire.
Ad Astra is almost entirely funded by Musk himself who gave the school 475 000 per year in 2014 and 2015 as Ars Technicadiscovered ina tax document filed withthe US Internal Revenue Service.
It s not clear what Musk s long term commitment to Ad Astra will be once his own children outgrow it.

Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, one of South Africa's capital cities.
8][9] Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.
10][11] His mother is Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.
12][13][14] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer, who was a half-owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika.
15][16][17][18] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.
14][19]
Musk's first car, a 1978 BMW 320i, clearly shows off his humble beginnings.
In fact, back in those days, a BMW wasn't quite the status symbol it is today.
Of course, this car is part of history itself, as it was the very first iteration of the legendary 3 Series we know and love today.
As he explains in a 2008 interview, Elon Musk saw both Edison and Tesla as role models.
He read books about both and found both of the visionaries inspiring.
Edison (1847–1931), of course, was probably America’s most illustrious inventor, being credited with important contributions such as the phonograph, an early motion picture camera, and a long-lasting light bulb.
Overall, the impact of his ideas on how we generate electricity, make sound and film recordings, or communicate are hard to overestimate.
Edison, holder of 1,093 patents, is also credited with creating the world’s first industrial-scale research laboratory.
Nikola Tesla (1856-1943), who once worked for Edison, was often a rival of the more-famous inventor.
While he died in relative obscurity and financial ruin, Tesla’s reputation has grown over time to perhaps eclipse Edison’s in the popular imagination.
After all, Tesla came up with the alternative current — the electrical supply system that was adopted more widely worldwide than Edison’s.
Tesla is also responsible for a variety of ahead-of-their-time inventions that have stoked the public’s fancy.
We are talking about wireless technology, including wireless transmission of electricity, early cellphones, self-driving and flying vehicles, as well as thought machines and death rays.
As you would expect, Elon Musk explains that he did name the car company Tesla after the inventor because it uses AC induction motors “which is an architecture Tesla developed.” According to Musk, Tesla deserves “a little more play than he gets in current society.”
But “on balance,” says Musk, “I’m a bigger fan of Edison than Tesla.” Why?
Because “Edison brought his stuff to market and made those inventions accessible to the world.” The shunned Serbian-Croatian inventor Tesla “didn’t really do that,” points out Musk.
Musk also names some other influences on his thinking – great “technologists” such as Apple’s Steve Jobs and Microsoft’s Bill Gates.
Even Disney was a great “innovator,” in Musk’s eyes.
 The answer, he learned, was boiler room cleaner.
Starting at just $18 an hour, Musk would don a hazmat suit, squeeze through a narrow tunnel into the boiler room, and shovel hot boiler-room muck back through the tunnel into a wheelbarrow.
