Obama's favorite food?

It's broccoli, kids!Staff WriterThe Columbus DispatchWASHINGTON - President Barack Obama likes burgers, hot dogs and such, but when it came time to answer a kid journalist's question about his favorite food, broccoli was the first word that sprang from his lips.This revelation came yesterday at a White House event that recognized children who won a healthy recipe contest, as part of first lady Michelle Obama's anti-obesity campaign.Having fun with the children, Obama agreed to take two questions from the journalists among them.
The first asked what was Obama's favorite food.
Broccoli was the presidential reply, according to a White House aide.This from a politician who has literally eaten his way across the country: burgers in a Washington suburb with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev; ribs in Asheville, N.C.; hot dogs at a basketball game in Dayton; and a tasty pastry called a kringle in Wisconsin.Obama's disclosure puts him starkly at odds with the culinary tastes of George H.W.
Bush, who as president famously declared his dislike for broccoli.
And I haven't liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it.
And I'm president of the United States, and I'm not going to eat any more broccoli!"
Bush said in 1990.Steamed broccoli growers shipped thousands of pounds of broccoli to the White House in protest, and the vegetable was farmed out to homeless shelters.Obama clearly was enjoying the spirit of the anti-obesity event, called the "Kids' State Dinner," which recognized winning recipes such as "picky eater pita pizza pockets" and "sweet potato turkey sliders.
Food can be fun.
It can be healthy," Obama said.
You are setting up habits that are going to be great your entire life.
He joked that he's not much of a cook.
In) my family, when they cooked vegetables, they were all boiled."
Since then, he said, he has learned that healthy food can also taste good.CareersStaff DirectoryAccessibilitySite MapLegalsOur Ethical PrinciplesSubscription Terms & ConditionsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact UsSupport Local BusinessAdvertise Your BusinessAdvertising Terms and ConditionsPromote your EventLicensing & ReprintsHelp CenterSubscriber GuideMy AccountGive FeedbackPromote Your EventSubscribe TodayNewslettersFacebookTwitterInstagrameNewspaperArchivesThisWeek News ArchivesJobsCarsHomesClassifiedsReviewed.com10BestEventsLocaliQ Digital Marketing SolutionsUSA TODAY Sports+© 2023 www.dispatch.com.

This redemption comes more than two decades after President George H.W.
Bush declared thathe didn’t like broccoliand was not going to eat it anymore.Obama briefly stopped by the Kids’ State Dinner, hosted by First Lady Michelle Obama.
One kid journalist at the event asked the president what his favorite food was, and broccoli was the answer.

When Obamacare was being debated in the Supreme Court in 2010, the question of whether the government couldmandatethat Americans eat a certain amount of broccoli because it is healthy was argued.There is a question, however, as to whether Obama’s love of broccoli is new.
During the 2012 election, Scholasticcitedthe commander in chief’s favorite foods as chili, french fries and pork chops.
Obama has also talked about his love ofnachos, his favorite junk food.Perhaps the president’s new found love of broccoli came from learning new ways to cook it?

Crowe/AP)President Barack Obamamay have carried a message of unity and tolerance during his visit last week toIndonesia, but it was his love of meatball soup that got the local headlines.
Bakso, nasi goreng ... semuanya enak!"
or "Meatball soup, fried rice ... it's all delicious!"
Obama said during a state dinner inJakarta.
The president spent several years of his childhood in the country.Bakso, a savory soup of meatballs and noodles often garnished with bok choy, wontons, tofu, crisp fried shallots and hard-boiled egg, is Indonesia's national street food, a go-to dish sold from pushcarts to hungry students, midnight revelers and just about anybody who wants a satisfying snack any time of day.
When people hang out at night and they feel hungry, they go for bakso," saysDjoko Supatmono, executive chef at Satay Junction, an Indonesian restaurant inNew York.Like many dishes that bubble up through the masses, bakso has endless variations.
The meatballs — which vary in size from golf balls to tennis balls — can be made with beef, chicken, pork or even fish.
Ditto for the stock.
The noodles can be made from mung bean starch, rice or wheat.
This soup takes on many guises, but it always has meatballs, it always has noodles, it always has broth," says Ken Woytisek, chef instructor in Asian cuisines at theCulinary Institute of America'sSt.
Helena,Calif., campus.
It's really a multicultural society, so there are lots of variations.
But it's mainly the meat in the meatball that changes."
For instance, Muslims, who form the majority in Indonesia, do not eat pork.Like most street food, bakso has an air of mystery.
The soup and the noodles probably originated inChina, but the meatball, Woytisek says, may have come from the Dutch, who colonized Indonesia in the 19th century.
And then there's the fact that it's street food.
While it's generally accepted that meat, in some form, is involved in the balls, the rest is unclear," saysJames Oseland, editor-in-chief ofSaveur magazine, and author of "Cradle of Flavor: Home Cooking from the Spice Islands of Indonesia,MalaysiaandSingapore."
Frankly, I don't know what goes into them, and probably we're better off not knowing.
It's like the hot dog.
Meatball soups are found throughout southeastAsia, but aficionados like Oseland especially prize bakso.
The Indonesian version really does tend to be the king, the real granddaddy of all of the southeast Asian beef ball brethren," he says.
It's the whole idea of Asian beef balls taken to a higher realm.
They're just better tasting.
But even Indonesians split hairs.
People will take you to task if you say 'I really like this vendor,'" Woytisek says.
They'll say 'No, no!
You have to go this vendor.'
They never tire of arguing over who's got the best.
But what are the criteria?
Al dente noodles and perfect meatballs.
What makes a great bakso is a springy versus rubbery ball," Oseland says.
And there's some sort of gentle spicing.
There's always this perfect balance between the spicing and the meat that separates the good ones from the mediocre.

Broccoli-Gate” is rearing its bushy, green head once again.President Barack Obama rekindled the long-running presidential debate over the green veggie Tuesday, saying at theKids’ State Dinner– a luncheon hosted by First Lady (and healthy-eating advocate)Michelle Obamato honor children who won a contest by submitting healthy recipes – that broccoli was his favorite food.The broccoli-brouhaha became a trending topic on Twitter, as people wondered whether the President was being honest or if his broccoli claim was really just a bunch of bologna.“What kind of POTUS says his fav food is Broccoli?” President George W. Bush’s former White House Press Secretary Ari FleischerTweeted.
Same one who in 2008 complained about the price of arugula at Whole Foods.”Mr.
Obama has reportedly said that as an adult he has learned how to prepare vegetables in more delicious ways.
Growing up, he noted, all his vegetables were boiled, reportstheWall Street Journal.Broccoli-Gate originated in 1990, when then-President George H. W. Bush famously banned the vegetable from Air Force One, saying, “I’m President of the United States and I’m not going to eat any more broccoli.”In protest, a reported 20,000 tons of the vegetable were sent to the White House.Perhaps the next President will love cauliflower.Related ArticlesWho Is Running for President in 2024?

Despite having all kinds of options to pick from, Obama once revealed this his favorite food of all time is actuallybroccoli.
While we have no doubt that Obama loves to indulge in a steaming plate of the green veggie, we also know what he likes to eat on his cheat days.President Barack Obama | Pete Souza/The White House via Getty ImagesBarack Obama’s favorite food is broccoliObama enjoys a good burger like the rest of us, but when it comes to hisfavorite food, broccoli is at the top of his list.Back in 2013, Obama was asked about his favorite type of food during a White House engagement geared toward children.
According to theTelegraph, Obama revealed that broccoli is his favorite food, though he did not reveal how he likes it cooked.Barack Obama’s favorite food is the exact opposite of former
President George H.W.
Bush, who once said that he cannot stand the taste of
broccoli.
In the 1990s, Bush revealed that he has not eaten the veggie since he
was a child and doesn’t think he’ll ever touch it again.“And I haven’t liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it.
And I’m President of the United States, and I’m not going to eat any more broccoli!” he stated.For Obama’s part, he picked broccoli in part to highlight the importance of healthy eating.
He was asked about the staple during an event that encouraged children toeat more vegetables, setting them up for healthier eating habits at a young age.“Food can be fun.
It can be healthy,” Obama said at the
time.
You are setting up habits that are going to be great your entire
life.”President Obama loves this treat on cheat dayBroccoli aside, there are times whenBarack Obamaindulges and eats his what might be his second favorite meal of all-time.
And that dish is featured at a Washington D.C. restaurant called Ben’s Chili Bowl.According toPittsburgh
Post-Gazette, prior to his inauguration, Obama stopped by the local
eatery with Adrian Fenty, the mayor of D.C., and ordered a half-smoked
chili-dog, complete with cheese fries and a large sweet tea.“Ya’ll have some Pepto-Bismol?” Obama said in a clip of
the outing.After Barack Obama’s visit went viral, Ben’s Chili Bowl witnessed
an increase in customers.
Many of these newcomers were tourists wanting to grab
a bite to eat at the same place as Obama did.Obama, of course, is hardly the first celebrity to enjoy a meal at Ben’s Chili Bowl.
The long-time establishment has seen many celebrities come and go, with disgraced comedian Bill Cosby being one of their most frequent guests.
Ben’s even went so far as to paint over Cosby’s mural inside the restaurant with one ofPresident Obama.There is no telling what Obama’s favorite haunt is now that he is
out of Washington, but it’s probably safe to assume that he still stops by
Ben’s Chili Bowl whenever he is in town.Barack Obama’s other favorite foodsOne of Obama’s other secret cheat day meals is pizza.
According
toSpoon
University, pizza is one of Obama’s top choices, outside of chili,
of course.
In fact, the Obamas frequently ordered this Italian staple during
his time at the White House.It all started on the campaign trail in Missouri, when Barack
Obama asked a staffer to get some pizza, they went out and got their favorite —
Pi Pizzeria.
He Liked the St. Louis style deep dish pizza so much he said it
was the best he had ever had.
He even had the owners come to Washington D.C. to
make the pizza together.Other dishes the Obamas enjoyed during their two terms in office were chips and guac, honey, chocolate-covered macadamia nuts, burgers (his favorite being Ray’s Hell Burger), and salmon (which Barack Obama loved to pair withbroccoli).Obama and his family also gained a reputation for being healthy
eaters when he was president.
Michelle had a prized garden at the White House
while he constantly encouraged children to eat local veggies.The couple also did a lot to change American Food Policy and get people to start developing healthier eating habits.Barack Obamaand Michelle Obama did so by endorsing healthy foods and banning chemicals and fats in certain processed foods.Tags:Barack ObamaInstagramYoutubeFacebookTwitterAbout UsContact UsCareersEthicsFact checking commitmentCorrections commitmentOwnership funding advertising infoSportscastingEndgame360MotorBiscuit© Copyright 2023 Endgame360 Inc.

That email doesn't look right.By adding your email you agree to get updates about Spoon University HealthierWith a lot of talk about Obama leaving office and Trump coming in, there has been tension among political parties.
In an attempt to lighten the overall "mood" of the situation and being the curious foodie I am, I've investigated what Obama and his family ate in their time at the White House.
I found out that the Obama family sure didn't skimp on good eats (both healthy and not-so-healthy) in their eight years in Washington.Chips and GuacWhether it be in front of the TV of behind the desk in the Oval Office, this family likes to snack ondelicious Mexican snackslike nachos andhomemade guacamole.HoneyWhen you have your own residential White House bee keeper tending to bees and dishing out fresh honey every day, it's hard not to have it with every meal.
Honey is natural and healthy, and can actuallyhelp you combat seasonal allergies.Fresh VeggiesYou may very well be aware about Michelle Obama's prized garden.
She encourages not just kids and families across America to eat healthy and eat local vegetables, but her own family as well.Her and Barack changed American Food Policy forever,by encouraging healthier eating and banning a lot of bad chemicals and fats.Chili Half-SmokeBarack's favorite #cheatdayeats can be found atBen's Chili Bowlin Washington D.C.
It's in fact so well-known that he frequents there that it's become almost a monument in the city, with a wall mural of Barack himself.
Putting a healthy spin on chili, the Obama's have a great homemadeTurkey Chili recipe to make at home.Chocolate Covered Macadamia NutsThere are always raw nuts around for Obama to keep his energy levels high, but sometimes a little twist on the common healthy snack is necessary.
A common treat in Hawaii, Obama likes to get back to his roots with thissweet snack.
They were a staple around the White House, and could be found in bowls in a number of the rooms.ApplesFor times where Obama wants to be a little healthier than chocolate covered nuts, he keeps abowl of applesin the center of the Oval Office for himself and guests to enjoy.
He definitely knows thereasons we should all be eating more apples.BurgersOne ofObama's favorite burger jointsisRay's Hell Burger,in Arlington, VA.
He's even brought esteemed foreign guests with him to join in on the deliciousness.
Simple, down-home places seem to be a guilty pleasure for Barack.PizzaAside from Chili, this is Obama's favorite food.
It may seem basic, but hey, there is nothing like agood pizza.
Pi Pizzeria is his go-to, where they serve up deep dish, gourmet, mouthwatering pies.
If this is making your stomach growl, don't forget you don't need to go out to get the good stuff.
You can makepizza yourself at homein a pinch.SalmonWhen the family needs a break from all of the the Chili, Burgers, and Pizza, a healthy meal they like to have at dinner isSalmon and Broccoli.The Obama's are all about healthy food and locally grown products.
While they do indulge like the rest of us, it's humbling to know that you're probably having the same thing for snacks and dinner at your house as the first family.facebooktwitterpinterestSharesNostalgicAdventurousAdultingLunchDinnerBreakfastSnackPop CultureNewsBucket ListAmy CormanUnion CollegeApril 28th, 2017Get more Spoon in your feed.twitteryoutubetiktokfacebooksnapchatinstagramGetSpoon Universitydelivered to youJoinYou tryna be tricky?

Go figure.President Barack Obama told an audience of high school students in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday that he was “not always the very best student” and that ethics “would not have made it on the list” of his favorite subjects.“I was not always the very best student that I could be when I was in high school, and certainly not when I was in middle school,” Obama said, speaking at Benjamin Banneker Academic High School.“I did not love every class I took.
I wasn’t always paying attention the way I should have,” Obama said.
I remember when I was in 8th grade I had to take a class called ethics.
Now, ethics is about right and wrong, but if you’d ask me what my favorite subject was back in 8th grade, it was basketball.
I don’t think ethics would have made it on the list.”00Report PostSaz!@12^lk*qmnd+(^);o)Saz!

It takes a strong ethical backbone to give a man a fair trial while being accused of a serious crime.

Kudos Barack for being a person and not a weird geeky robot (at least back then).Also, in a security/war situation, the rules for due process change--Al-Awlaki simply couldn't get the standard due process for an American citizen apprehended in the United States.
He had a different, but no less justified and legal, form of due process.
Read the Constitution--the executive and legislature are the fora for due process in war-time, and to argue that this wasn't a war-strike is naive and silly.00Report PostRusty ShacklefordRusty ShacklefordAnonymous PosterReport User#711 years ago10/01/2011 2:17pm EDTre:end government greedReplyBack To IndexForum IndexOh my god, a 14 year old preferred playing sports to sitting in class?!

Did Obama Do Well in High School?
 StudyPugBlogMain siteStudyPug Essay ContestDid Obama Do Well in High School?Whenever a skilled and talented individual reaches the pinnacle of success and is under the spotlight, everyone else becomes interested with that person’s story and how he/she got there.
Most people would think that there must have been some rare cosmic event or a miraculous series of events that brought about such a success, but that usually isn’t the case.In a lot of cases, it usually begins from a background that is quite ordinary and even mundane.Take the case ofBarack Obama, the President of the United States of America.
He is the first non-white American to hold the position, and he has been serving two consecutive terms.Image via HuffpostHis administration has been both celebrated and controversial, depending on which side of the fence you’re looking from.
How the world have come to know him as a household name is mostly from his ability to captivate audiences with his oratory brilliance.While he may seem like a stalwart of all things great in today’s world, his beginnings are not that extraordinary.
While his origins are more or less unusual, he as a youth wasn’t that special.Obama studied in Punahou School, a private school in Honolulu, Hawaii, from 5th to 12th grade, graduating in 1979.
Looking back, his stay there wasn’t anything remarkable.
Some may even say that he may not have deserved to be there, having beenadmitted with the help of his grandfather’s bosswho was an alum of the school.His academic performance was far from spectacular.
He was a B student who also got a D in eighth-grade French.
His priorities were more focused on parties, going to the beach, and playing basketball.He was on the basketball team that went on to win the state championship in his senior year, but his coach didn’t start him.
He also played defensive line on Punahou’s football team in his freshman year, so he was definitely athletic even back then.Image via AmazonawsBarry, as he was called back then, was generally well-liked and seemed content, but his mixed heritage meant that he didn’t have a good idea of his own identity and where his true passions lied.He went through the various phases commonly experienced by most adolescent males, having experimented with various activities and taken up vices that may have not been recommended for any respectable young man.Despite his middling academic performance, professors did comment on his untapped potential, which would then prove to be true.He grew up in a middle class family, so he wasn’t up against big struggles that are usually characteristic of stories like this.
In fact, most may think of his story early on as rather unremarkable and even one to frown upon for more ambitious and high-strung individuals.But then again, for a lot of people who go on to become successful in life, not all of them were overachievers to begin with.It may be hard to think for some people that the eloquent and charismatic politician based in Chicago who would go on to become the President of the United States of America was actually a slacker.
But then again, so was George W. Bush, so it’s not like his case is unique for an American president, much less a particularly successful individual.If anything, it only serves to humanize his story even more and make him relatable to the average Joe.Reflecting on these formative years, he would write: “The opportunity that Hawaii offered to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect, became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.”So in short,Barack Obama did fairly alright in high school.
He wasn’t really a bad student, but he was no scholar either during that time.
He did a bit better later on in college and early in his career, where he finally found his calling in public service.He would go on to study inHarvard Law Schooland met his wife Michelle while working as an associate at a law firm.
He chose to settle in Chicago and pursued a political career.
The rest after that is history.Like the Article?

Photograph: Lisa Jack/Getty ImagesBarack ObamaBarack Obama: the college yearsIn 1979, he was an 18-year-old freshman who liked Earth, Wind & Fire and wore silly hats.
David Maraniss' new biography reveals how Barry from Honolulu became Barack, president of the United StatesDavid MaranissFri 25 May 2012 18.00 EDTHe had turned 18 a few weeks earlier.
The afro he started at Punahou School had grown a bit fuller, but was under control.
He was Barry Obama, freshman, from Honolulu.
The name, along with those of his two new roommates, was typed on the index card that had been slotted on to the door of Room A104 of Haines Hall annexe in preparation for his arrival.
Maybe his face didn't look Hawaiian at first glance, thought Jeff Yamaguchi, who lived down the hall and whose family was from the islands, but it quickly became apparent that he had the easy-going attitude of a Hawaiian local, "that mannerism and style and personality that is very unique and identifiable from tourists… a mentality you develop over time, just 'Whatever.
It was autumn 1979 when Obama arrived atOccidental College, a small liberal arts college in Los Angeles.
The campus was much like his school in Honolulu, with gentle slopes and flowering landscapes.
Its academic expectations were equally high and the weather in southern California sunny.
All so familiar, but Obama had come to college in search of something more.In the end, his stay at Occidental would compose only half of his college experience.
Just two school years, when he was 18 and 19, from August 1979 to June 1981.
But in the development of the person he was to become, Occidental was significant.Obama's roommates were Paul Carpenter, a blond southern Californian who occasionally took his friends surfing (bodysurfing, in Barry's case), and Imad Husain, an intellectual Pakistani with a droll sense of humour who grew up in Karachi (though his parents now lived in Dubai) and finished his secondary education at Bedford School in the UK.
Barry Obama played a lot of Hendrix, Earth, Wind & Fire and Billie Holiday, but was known in the annexe for his wicked impression of Mick Jagger.
He could do the walk, the strut, the face.The annexe was home to African-Americans and international students from the Asian subcontinent, budding intellectuals and aspiring writers, party animals, surfer dudes and jocks.
Barry Obama represented a bit of each of them: he was black and white, surfer, basketballer, writer and perceptive observer, wholly American and yet the son of an African and intimately familiar with Asia from his years in Indonesia.
His ability to connect across racial and cultural lines was not merely a superficial art of survival but rooted in his life and being.Most of Obama's classmates could not see how hard he was working to reconcile the contradictions that life threw at him.
They thought he was cool, smart without being pedantic, and seemed to have his act together.
To Mark Parsons, who came to know him mostly because they both smoked and spent a lot of time together huddling outside the student union, Obama seemed "almost Zen in walking through all the chaos in our dorm".
He displayed one trait that showed he wanted to be a player though: he wore a lot of "stupid hats".
He usually wore them cocked, to look cool.
Obama also had a peculiar smoking style, a little affectation.
He turned his wrist up and cupped the cigarette between thumb and index finger.
He smoked a cigarette the same way he smoked a joint.
I have a sense that he smoked because he was addicted, as I was," Parsons said.
But, Obama told Parsons, there was another reason.
I remember him telling me he would quit after he got married.
He didn't want to quit smoking because he said he would gain weight, but after he got married it would be OK to gain weight.
I think it was mostly a joke.
A fellow student, Lisa Jack, an aspiringAnnie Leibovitzwho went around campus persuading interesting people to let her photograph them, recalls that a friend "started to tell me about this really good-looking guy.
His name is Barry and people are talking about him."
To have Lisa Jack shoot profiles of you was considered a mark of distinction, and Obama gladly accepted the offer.At about 11 one morning he turned up ready and eager for his photo shoot.
He was wearing flip-flops, jeans and a collared shirt with button-down breast pockets.
He brought along a pack of non-filter cigarettes, a wide-brimmed boater hat and a bomber jacket.
Jack did not instruct him on the wardrobe or accessories; they were all his idea.
He started to experiment, moving around for different poses.
It was one of those times when his ambition was unmistakable.
He blew smoke like he was on a Bob Dylan album jacket.
He put on his hat and cocked it low like he was Hendrix.
I think he was into it," Jack recalled.
He was pleased he had been asked.
In the subjects he preferred, political science and literature, Obama signed up for as many advanced courses as he could take.
In any discussion, Obama would listen to everyone else before bringing in his point of view.
Jeff Yamaguchi put it this way: "He listens and he listens and he listens, rather than respond immediately to the first thing that's out there.
It's like, 'Let's let it percolate for a little.
Let's let it simmer.'
He reads people really well.
He doesn't use the same play for every person.
He has different plays in his playbook.
He adjusts to the situation.
The four African students at Occidental called Obama their brother; he told them how much he wanted to go to Africa to see his father and his roots.
He talked to one of them, Kofi Manu, a Ghanaian, about finding an apartment in their sophomore year, but instead moved into a place with his Pakistani friend Hasan Chandoo.
Their place became a regular hangout for the Pakistanis and their friends.
It was in this company Obama felt most comfortable.
These were my closest friends," he noted decades later, during an interview in the Oval Office.
Race was not a factor.
It was an international sensibility that brought them together, Obama said.
I think there is no doubt… they were sort of world citizens, with kind of peripatetic lives.
All of them had that sort of shared characteristic of spanning cultures, which I think strengthened our friendships.
The late-night discussions he participated in now were more intense than those of his freshman year, more overtly political, more directed at America's role in the world.
Chandoo and the other Pakistanis, along with the writers Obama associated with, had a seriousness of purpose and a worldly sensibility.His classmates considered Obama "a floater", moving not only from culture to culture but also from political group to political group, dabbling, showing interest, but never staking a home.
This was a natural part of college experimentation, to be sure, but in Obama's case it reflected a deeper and longer-lasting trend, one that would define his life in and out of politics: his need and ability to avoid traps.
The less entrenched he was, the easier it was for him to get out of something and move on.He had become part of Occidental's activist network, participating in a vigil protesting against the imprisonment of Nelson Mandela.
It led him to give the first public political speech of his life, on 18 February 1981, giving him the first intimations of what it was like to move crowds, large or small, with words.
But after only two years at Occidental, Obama was ready to go.
In late March he filled out applications to transfer toColumbiain New York.
He wanted to go deeper into the American experience, and the black experience.
I figured that if there weren't any more black students at Columbia than there were at Oxy, I'd at least be in the heart of it," he said.The next four years in New York, from late summer 1981 to midsummer 1985, was a lonely time.
As Obama put it himself, decades later, "I was leading an ascetic existence, way too serious for my own good".He felt no attachments to Columbia, but he did enter into a relationship with Alexandra McNear, a former Occidental classmate.
McNear had edited Occidental's literary magazine, Feast, in which Obama had published two poems.
In fact, the nameBarack Obama, as opposed to Barry, premiered in public in the magazine's inaugural issue.
McNear was in New York that summer after her junior year and for nearly two months they were lovers in Manhattan.When it was time for McNear to return to Occidental, they began a long-distance relationship, conducted mostly through a series of passionate letters.
Obama was the central character in his letters, in a self-conscious way, with variations on the theme of his search for purpose and self-identity.
In one letter, he told McNear that it seemed all his Pakistani friends were headed towards the business world, and his old high school buddies from Honolulu were "moving toward the mainstream".
Where did that leave him?
I must admit large dollops of envy for both groups," he wrote.
Caught without a class, a structure, or tradition to support me, in a sense the choice to take a different path is made for me… The only way to assuage my feelings of isolation are to absorb all the traditions [and all the] classes; make them mine, me theirs.
Here, at 22, was an idea that would become a key to understanding Obama the politician and public figure.
Without a class" meant he was entering his adult life without financial security.
Without a "structure" meant he had grown up lacking a solid family foundation, his father gone from the start, his mother often elsewhere, his grandparents doing the best they could, but all leading to his sense of being a rootless outsider.
Without a "tradition" was a reference to his lack of religious grounding and his status as both white and black, feeling completely at home in neither race.
Eventually he could make a few essential choices in terms of how he would live out his personal life, moving inexorably towards the black world.
But in a larger sense, in terms of his ambitions beyond family, he did not want to be constricted by narrow choices.
The different path he saw for himself was to rise above the divisions of culture and society, politics and economics, and embrace something larger.
To make a particular choice would be to limit him, he wrote in the letter to McNear, because "taken separately, they are unacceptable and untenable".Looking back on that period from the distance of the White House, Obama recalled that he was then "deep inside my own head… in a way that in retrospect I don't think was real healthy".
But the realisation that he had to "absorb all the traditions" would become the rationale for all that followed.
There is no doubt that what I retained in my politics is a sense that the only way I could have a sturdy sense of identity of who I was depended on digging beneath the surface differences of people," Obama said during an interview on 10 November 2011.
The only way my life makes sense is if, regardless of culture, race, religion, tribe, there is this commonality, these essential human truths and passions and hopes and moral precepts that are universal.
And that we can reach out beyond our differences.
If that is not the case, then it is pretty hard for me to make sense of my life.
So that is at the core of who I am.
During his Columbia days, Obama discussed his struggle for identity not only with McNear but with a few friends from the Pakistani crowd.
One of his acquaintances in that group was Mir Mahboob Mahmood, known to his friends by his nickname, Beenu.
They were never the closest of friends, yet their conversations seemed to bring out Obama's innermost thoughts and hopes.Mahmood remembered how, "for a period of two or three months", Obama "carried and at every opportunity read and reread a fraying copy ofRalph Ellison's Invisible Man.
It was a period during which Barack was struggling deeply within himself to attain his own racial identity, and Invisible Man became a prism for his self-reflection.
By Mahmood's account, they had known each other only a few months when Obama posed this question to him: "Do you think I will be president of the United States?
What did this mean?
I think it was a very serious question, and clearly, at least in my mind, this was where he was headed," Mahmood recalled.
His answer then: "If America is ready for a black president, you can make it.
When Obama, during the White House interview, was asked about Mahmood's account, he said he could not remember such a conversation, and that people had a natural tendency to apply memories to him retroactively, but added, "If he has a vivid memory of it, I won't deny it."
The ambitious path he saw for himself then, Obama said, remained vague.
I don't think I could see a clear path [to the presidency]," he said.
At that age I was much more interested in being a leader outside of politics.
If you had asked me during that time what kind of career I'd love to have, more likely I would have said something like aBob Moses[the civil rights leader], maybe with a slightly higher profile than that.
Obama with his father, Barack Obama, Sr.
Photograph: Obama For AmericaIn a letter postmarked 22 November 1982, Obama wrote to McNear that he would be coming to Los Angeles for the semester break.
The day after he sent the letter, his father was killed in a car accident in Nairobi.A father he had barely known, gone.
His grandparents thousands of miles away, and his mother farther away still.
It would be hard to overstate the loneliness young Obama felt at that moment, by himself in New York.
But in December, when Obama and McNear reunited in Los Angeles, he casually mentioned it.
It "was not an emotional telling on his side", she said.
They stayed at her apartment for most of two weeks.
McNear wrote in her journal then that Obama "was the closest friend I had, and that I really loved him but didn't know if we could sustain a relationship".She wrote to Obama, expressing the fear that he was becoming less interested in her.
He wrote back on 4 April that she was mistaken.
He was "burning the midnight oil" to finish his studies, he said.
And he was, as usual, consumed by the effort to find himself.
I feel sunk in that long corridor between old values, modes of thought, and those that I seek, that I work towards," he confided.Obama skipped the graduation ceremonies, finishing his time at Columbia much as he had begun: isolated and apart from the college scene.
He had his résumé completed by the time he finished classes.
He took temporary employment where he could find it, spending one week supervising a group of temp workers at the New York fire department.
It was, he reported, "a fascinating experience affording me a taste of the grinding toil of a low-white-collar job, as well as the ambivalent relationship" between bosses and workers.
Here were people talking about sports and life and family in ways that were not fraught with complicated meanings and symbols, he wrote in a letter to his now former girlfriend McNear.
I felt a greater affinity to the blacks and Latinos there (who predictably comprised about three-fourths of the workforce…) than I had felt in a long time, and it strengthened me in some important way.
Obama was six months out of Columbia when Genevieve Cook came along and engaged him in the deepest romantic relationship of his young life.
They met at a Christmas party in 1983.
Cook was Australian, an assistant-teacher in Brooklyn.
Like Obama, she had lived in Indonesia, before her parents divorced, and again briefly in high school.
She called him BAH‑rruck, with a trill of the r's.
She said that is how he pronounced it himself, at least when talking to her.He was living on the Upper West Side then and working in a job that paid the rent but did not inspire him.
He was still keeping mostly to himself, occasionally hanging out with his Pakistani friends, who partied too much and too hard, he thought, but were warm and generous and buoyant intellectual company, always willing to debate philosophy and the political issues of the day.
Cook offered something more.
She was three years older, born in 1958.
She kept a journal, as he did; brooded about her identity, as he did; had an independent, at times exasperating mother, as he did; and burned with an idealism to right the wrongs of the world, as he did.Obama with former lover Genevieve Cook.
He is very beautiful,’ Cook wrote in her diary.
Oooooo, I can’t wait to be in Brooklyn with spring coming.’Day by day, week by week, Cook's perceptions of Obama, noted in her journal, became more complicated.January 26, 1984…how is he so old already, at the age of 22?
I have to recognise (despite play of wry and mocking smile on lips) that I find his thereness very threatening… Distance, distance, distance, and wariness.
I am wary – very clear – I really wonder where it's all going, all this with Barack.February 19Despite Barack's having talked of drawing a circle around the tender in him – protecting the ability to feel innocence and springborn – I think he also fights against showing it to others, to me.
I really like him more and more – he may worry about posturing and void inside but he is a brimming and integrated character.February 24My British humour comes through with him – very uncommon.
An uncommon, earnest young man.
He is very beautiful – more than he thinks himself to be.
Oooooo I can't wait to be in Brooklyn with spring coming…February 25... the sexual warmth is definitely there – but the rest of it has sharp edges and I'm finding it all unsettling and finding myself wanting to withdraw from it all.
I have to admit that I am feeling anger at him for some reason, multi‑stranded reasons.
His warmth can be deceptive.
Tho he speaks sweet words and can be open and trusting, there is also that coolness – and I begin to have an inkling of some things about him that could get to me.May 16It so delights me that from time to time Barack will talk about the more private, inner aspects of what he sees and feels of our relationship – not out of some need to bring up and solve a problem (which is what I tend to do), but merely to communicate it.
It is something I could well learn to do.
To trust him, myself, whatever's cooking there in my brain – the good and the cloudy.June 10Barack frets about the continual comfort I am always willing to offer – recognising it as feeling good, but also chafing against the threat of its impeding a rawer sense of "the struggle"…June 20Curious this thing in Barack, where he identifies "skipping out" on eg Sohale's dinner, with the taking of different paths.
He doesn't just see it as preferring to stay home and start a new story.
Somehow splitting himself off from people is necessary to his feeling of following some chosen route?
which basically remains undefined.
And am I to be left behind also?
That he may feel he's striking out?
Shedding encumbrances, old images, the known and comfortable…June 27But the abruptness and the apparent lack of warmth w/ which B. left them was jarring.Beenu Mahmood saw a shift in Obama that corresponded to Cook's perceptions.
He could see Obama slowly but carefully distancing himself from the Pakistanis as a necessary step in establishing his political identity.
For years, Obama seemed to share their attitudes as sophisticated outsiders who looked at politics from an international perspective.
But to get to where he wanted to go, he had to change – not cut off the Pakistanis as friends, but push away enough to establish a clear and separate identity.
As a result, Mahmood recalled, "The first shift I saw him undertaking was to view himself as an American in a much more fundamental way.
In preparing for his future, Obama disciplined himself in two activities: writing and running.
He was what Cook called "a virtuous daily jogger", and that was one of the differences between them.
She would run, too, but without his discipline and not as far.
One of the reasons he was maybe such a dedicated jogger was part of him still felt he was the fat boy, which I found hard to see," Cook said later.
He had indeed been a chubby boy from infancy through seventh grade, when his body started to elongate.
Cook noticed that despite his thin physique, there was still a certain softness to him: "There was this still quite raw and close to the surface aspect of himself which had to do with being the fat boy, or chubby boy, that people laughed at, that no one knew quite where to put, and who had a deeply ambivalent notion of being loved or not.
They talked about race quite often, as part of his inner need to find a sense of belonging.
She sympathised with and encouraged his search for his identity.
If she felt like an outsider, he was a double outsider, racial and cross-cultural.
He looked black, but was he?
At times he confessed to her that "he felt like an imposter.
Because he was so white.
There was hardly a black bone in his body."
At some point that summer she realised that "in his own quest to resolve his ambivalence about black and white, it became very, very clear to me that he needed to go black".Mahmood saw the same thing as Cook: Obama's internal struggle with his racial identity.
He related it to his memory of Obama carrying around that dog-eared copy of Ellison's Invisible Man, and also to his memory of the day Obama wondered whether he could ever be president.
Trying to embrace his blackness, Mahmood thought, was "probably the biggest shift I saw [in Obama during the New York years]… Barack was the most deliberate person I ever met in terms of constructing his own identity… That was an important period for him, first the shift from not international but American, number one, and then not white, but black.
Early in Obama's relationship with Cook, he had told her about "his adolescent image of the perfect ideal woman" and how he had searched for her "at the expense of hooking up with available girls".
Who was this ideal woman?
In her journals, Cook conjured her in her mind, and it was someone other than herself.
I can't help thinking that what he would really want, be powerfully drawn to, was a woman, very strong, very upright, a fighter, a laugher, well‑experienced – a black woman I keep seeing her as," she wrote.This is an edited extract from Barack Obama: The Making Of The Man, by David Maraniss, published next week by Atlantic Books at £25.

PresidentsBarack ObamaBarack Obama: Life Before the PresidencyByConsulting Editor: Michael NelsonPhoto: University of ChicagoBarack Hussein Obama II was born on August 4, 1961, in Hawaii.
His parents, who met as students at the University of Hawaii, were Ann Dunham, a white American from Kansas, and Barack Obama Sr., a black Kenyan studying in the United States.
Obama's father left the family when Obama was two and, after further studies at Harvard University, returned to Kenya, where he died in an automobile accident nineteen years later.
After his parents divorced, Obama's mother married another foreign student at the University of Hawaii, Lolo Soetoro of Indonesia.
From age six through ten, Obama lived with his mother and stepfather in Indonesia, where he attended Catholic and Muslim schools.
I was raised as an Indonesian child and a Hawaiian child and as a black child and as a white child,” Obama later recalled.
And so what I benefited from is a multiplicity of cultures that all fed me.”Concerned for his education, Obama’s mother sent him back to Hawaii to live with her parents, Stanley and Madelyn Dunham, and to attend Hawaii’s prestigious Punahou School from fifth grade through graduation from high school.
While Obama was in school, his mother divorced Soetoro, returned to Hawaii to study cultural anthropology at the university, and then went back to Indonesia to do field research.
Living with his grandparents, Obama was a good but not outstanding student at Punahou.
He played varsity basketball and, as he later admitted, “dabbled in drugs and alcohol,” including marijuana and cocaine.
As for religion, Obama later wrote, because his parents and grandparents were nonbelievers, “I was not raised in a religious household.”Obama's mother, who “to the end of her life [in 1995] would proudly proclaim herself an unreconstructed liberal,” deeply admired the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and taught her son, he later wrote, that “To be black was to be the beneficiary of a great inheritance, a special destiny, glorious burdens that only we were strong enough to bear.” But, as culturally diverse as Hawaii was, its African American population was miniscule.
With no father or other family members to serve as role models (his relationship with his white grandfather was difficult), Obama later reflected, “I was trying to raise myself to be a black man in America, and beyond the given of my appearance, no one around me seemed to know exactly what that meant.”Obama left Hawaii for college, enrolling first at Occidental College in Los Angeles for his freshman and sophomore years, and then at Columbia University in New York City.
He read deeply and widely about political and international affairs, graduating from Columbia with a political science major in 1983.
A movie version of his Columbia years,Barry, was released in 2016.)
After spending an additional year in New York as a researcher with Business International Group, a global business consulting firm, Obama accepted an offer to work as a community organizer in Chicago's largely poor and black South Side.
As biographer David Mendell notes in his 2007 book,Obama: From Promise to Power, the job gave Obama “his first deep immersion into the African American community he had longed to both understand and belong to.”Obama's main assignment as an organizer was to launch the church-funded Developing Communities Project and, in particular, to organize residents of Altgeld Gardens to pressure Chicago's city hall to improve conditions in the poorly maintained public housing project.
His efforts met with some success, but he concluded that, faced with a complex city bureaucracy, “I just can't get things done here without a law degree.”In 1988, Obama enrolled at Harvard Law School, where he excelled as a student, graduating magna cum laude and winning election as president of the prestigious Harvard Law Review for the academic year 1990-1991.
Although Obama was a liberal, he won the election by persuading the journal’s outnumbered conservative staffers that he would treat their views fairly, which he is widely acknowledged to have done.
As the first African American president in the long history of the law review, Obama drew widespread media attention and a contract from Random House to write a book about race relations.
The book,Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance(1995), turned out to be mostly a personal memoir, focusing in particular on his struggle to come to terms with his identity as a black man raised by whites in the absence of his African father.During a summer internship at Chicago’s Sidley and Austin law firm after his first year at Harvard, Obama met Michelle Robinson, a South Side native and Princeton University and Harvard Law School graduate who supervised his work at the firm.
He wooed her ardently (as memorialized in another 2016 movie,Southside with You), and after a four-year courtship they married in 1992.
The Obamas settled in Chicago's racially integrated, middle-class Hyde Park neighborhood, where their first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998 and their second daughter, Natasha (called Sasha), was born in 2001.After directing Illinois Project Vote, a voter registration drive aimed at increasing black turnout in the 1992 election, Obama accepted positions as an attorney with the civil rights law firm of Miner, Barnhill and Galland and as a lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School.
He launched his first campaign for political office in 1996 after his district’s state senator, Alice Palmer, decided to run for Congress.
With Palmer’s support, Obama announced his candidacy to replace her in the Illinois legislature.
When Palmer's congressional campaign faltered, she decided to run for reelection instead.
But Obama refused to withdraw from the race, successfully challenged the validity of Palmer’s voter petitions, and was easily elected after her name was kept off the ballot.Obama’s time in the legislature initially was frustrating.
Republicans controlled the state senate, and many of his black Democratic colleagues resented the hardball tactics he had employed against Palmer.
But he adapted, developing cordial personal relations with legislators of both parties and cultivating Senate Democratic leader Emil Jones Jr., another African American senator from Chicago, as a mentor.
Obama was able to get campaign finance reform and crime legislation enacted even when his party was in the minority, and after 2002, when the Democrats won control of the Senate, he became a leading legislator on a wide range of issues, passing nearly 300 bills aimed at helping children, old people, labor unions, and the poor.Obama’s one serious misstep during his early political career (he later called it “an ill-considered race” in which he got “spanked” by the voters) was a 2000 Democratic primary challenge to US Representative Bobby Rush.
Rush was a former Illinois Black Panther leader who subsequently entered mainstream politics as a Chicago alderman and was elected to Congress from the South Side’s first congressional district in 1992.
Obama was not nearly as well known as the popular Rush, and the combination of his unusual upbringing and his association with predominantly white elite universities such as Columbia, Harvard, and Chicago aroused doubts about his authenticity as a black man among the district’s overwhelmingly African American voters.
Obama suffered what he labeled “a drubbing,” losing to Rush by a 30-percentage point margin.
Rush remained in the House; he was reelected to his thirteenth consecutive term in 2016.Returning to the state senate, Obama began eyeing a 2004 race for the US Senate seat held by Peter Fitzgerald, an unpopular first-term Republican who decided not to run for reelection.
In October 2002, as Congress was considering a resolution authorizing President George W. Bush to launch a war to depose the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, Obama spoke at an antiwar rally in Chicago.
I don't oppose all wars,” he declared.
What I am opposed to is a dumb war.
What I am opposed to is a rash war.” By speaking out against Bush’s war policies, Obama set himself apart from the other leading candidates for the Democratic Senate nomination, as well as from most Senate Democrats with presidential ambitions, including Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, John Kerry of Massachusetts, and John Edwards of North Carolina.
Obama’s initially unpopular antiwar stance eventually worked to his political advantage as the war became increasingly unpopular with the passage of time.Advised by political consultant David Axelrod, who had a strong record of helping black candidates succeed in majority-white constituencies, Obama assembled a coalition of African Americans and white liberals to win the Democratic Senate primary with 53 percent of the vote, more than all five of his opponents combined.
He then moved toward the political center to wage his general election campaign against Republican nominee Jack Ryan, an attractive candidate who, after making hundreds of millions of dollars as an investor, had left the business world to teach in an inner-city Chicago school.
But Ryan was forced to drop out of the race when scandalous details about his divorce were made public, and Obama coasted to an easy victory against Ryan’s replacement on the ballot, black conservative Republican Alan Keyes.
Obama won by the largest margin in the history of Senate elections in Illinois, 70 percent to 27 percent.In addition to his election, the other highlight of 2004 for Obama was his wildly successful keynote address at the Democratic National Convention.
There’s not a liberal America and a conservative America,” he declared.
There’s a United States of America.
There’s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America.
There’s a United States of America.” Obama encapsulated his speech’s themes of optimism and unity with the phrase, “the audacity of hope,” which he borrowed from Reverend Jeremiah Wright.
Wright was the pastor of Chicago’s Trinity United Church of Christ, a large and influential black congregation where Obama was baptized when he became a Christian in 1988.
Obama also used the phrase as the title of his second book,The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream(2006), which became a national bestseller in the wake of his newfound national popularity.
Describing his religious conversion, Obama wrote, “I felt God’s spirit beckoning me.
I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth.”Consulting Editor: Michael NelsonProfessor of Political ScienceRhodes CollegeBarack Obama's educationPunahou School, HawaiiOccidental College, Los AngelesColumbia University, New York CityHarvard Law School, BostonMore ResourcesBarack Obama Presidency PageBarack Obama EssaysLife in BriefLife Before the Presidency (Current Essay)Campaigns & ElectionsDomestic AffairsForeign AffairsFamily LifeImpact and LegacyUniversity of VirginiaMiller CenterMain navigationThe PresidencyIssues & PolicyExpertsEventsDonateUVA Democracy BiennialFooterAboutContact UsMiller Center Governing CouncilMiller Center FoundationPrivacy PolicyNotice of Non-Discrimination and Equal OpportunityDownload millercenter.org DataHelp inform the discussionSupport the Miller CenterFacebookTwitterYouTubeSubscribe© Copyright 2023.

Over this decade, employment in jobs requiring education beyond a high school diploma will grow more rapidly than employment in jobs that do not; of the 30 fastest growing occupations, more than half require postsecondary education.
With the average earnings of college graduates at a level that is twice as high as that of workers with only a high school diploma, higher education is now the clearest pathway into the middle class.In higher education, the U.S. has been outpaced internationally.
In 1990, the U.S. ranked first in the world in four-year degree attainment among 25-34 year olds; today, the U.S. ranks 12th.
We also suffer from a college attainment gap, as high school graduates from the wealthiest families in our nation are almost certain to continue on to higher education, while just over half of our high school graduates in the poorest quarter of families attend college.
And while more than half of college students graduate within six years, the completion rate for low-income students is around 25 percent.Acknowledging these factors early in his Administration, President Obama challenged every American to commit to at least one year of higher education or post-secondary training.
The President has also set a new goal for the country: that by 2020, America would once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.To achieve this bold goal for college completion, ensure that America’s students and workers receive the education and training needed for the jobs of today and tomorrow, and provide greater security for the middle class, President Obama and his Administration are working to make college more accessible, affordable, and attainable for all American families.Helping Middle Class Families Afford CollegeAmerica is home to the best colleges and universities in the world — and increasing college attainment has never been more important to our economic competitiveness — yet tuition and fees have skyrocketed over the past decade, making it more difficult for American families to invest in a higher education for their future.
Today’s college students borrow and rack up more debt than ever before.
In 2010, graduates who took out loans left college owing an average of more than $26,000.
Student loan debt has now surpassed credit card debt for the first time ever.Our nation’s commitment to placing a good education within reach of all who are willing to work for it helped build a strong American middle class over the past several generations.
In keeping this promise alive, President Obama has expanded federal support to help more students afford college, while calling for a shared responsibility in tackling rising college costs.
President Obama’s efforts of reform in higher education funding have produced the largest investment in student aid since the G.I.
Bill, while resulting in a more efficient, reliable, and effective system for students to help them afford college and manage debt:Learn MoreDoubling Investments in Pell GrantsThe President has raised the maximum Pell Grant award to $5,730 for the 2014-15 award year — a nearly $1,000 increase since 2008.
Under the President’s leadership, the number of Pell Grant recipients has expanded by 50 percent over that same time, providing college access to millions of additional low-income and middle-class students across the country.
The Obama Administration’s landmark investment in the Pell Grant was enacted in theHealth Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which ended student loan subsidies for private financial institutions and banks and shifted over $60 billion in savings back to students.Helping Students Manage Student Loan DebtThe Administration’s “Pay as You Earn” plan expandsincome-based repaymentto enable 1.6 million students to take advantage of a new option to cap repayment of student loans at 10 percent of monthly income — an option that student borrowers can begin to use at the end of this year.
These changes will reduce the burden of student loans in a fiscally responsible way.
Additionally, millions of borrowers are now eligible to consolidate Direct Loans and FFEL Loans and save up to half a percentage point on their interest rate.For more information:Everything you need to know about income-based repaymentExpanding Education Tax CreditsPresident Obama established the American Opportunity Tax Credit in 2009 to assist families with the costs of college, providing up to $10,000 for four years of college tuition for families earning up to $180,000.
11.5 million families are expected to now benefit from the American Opportunity Tax Credit.Keeping Student Loan Interest Rates LowIn his 2012 State of the Union address, the President called on Congress to keep interest rates low for the 7.4 million borrowers who take out subsidized Federal student loans for this school year.
With President Obama’s leadership,rates on new subsidized Stafford loans remained at 3.4 percent— instead of doubling to 6.8 percent — this past summer.
This bold action saved students an average of $1,000 on the life of their loans, and President Obama has committed to keeping interest rates low for student loans moving forward.In August,President Obama signed a billthat takes an important step in fulfilling our nation's obligations to students.
The bipartisan legislation cuts rates on all new loans this year and save a typical undergraduate student $1,500 over the life of those loans.Learn more:Fact Sheet on Bipartisan Student Loan DealStrengthening Community CollegesThe President has placed a strong emphasis on making America’s community colleges stronger, ensuring that they are gateways to economic prosperity and educational opportunities for millions of Americans each year.
Each year, over 1,100 community colleges provide students and workers with critical skills.
To help reach the President’s college attainment goal, the Obama Administration has called for a new partnership with states to ensure that the first two years of community college are free for responsible students, whether they are completing the first half of a bachelor’s degree or earning skills to go directly into the workforce.In 2010, the President convened the first White House Summit on Community Colleges to focus on the important role these institutions play in our effort to increase the number of college graduates and prepare those graduates to lead the 21st century workforce.
The President has demonstrated his commitment to deepening and expanding that work:Learn MoreAmerica's College PromiseNearly a century ago, a movement that made high school widely available helped lead to rapid growth in the education and skills training of Americans, driving decades of economic growth and prosperity.
Now, President Obama has called for the first two years of community college to be free for responsible students, helping students earn the first half of a bachelor’s degree and earn skills needed in the workforce at no cost.The America’s College Promise proposal would create a new partnership with states to help them waive tuition in high-quality programs for responsible students, while promoting key reforms to help more students complete at least two years of college.
If all states participate, an estimated 9 million students could benefit.
A full-time community college student could save an average of $3,800 in tuition per year.Technical Training for Middle Class JobsIn January 2015, the President proposed the American Technical Training Fund to award programs that have strong employer partnerships and include work-based learning opportunities, provide accelerated training, and are scheduled to accommodate part-time work.
This discretionary budget proposal would fund 100 centers to help high-potential, low-wage workers gain the skills to work into growing fields with significant numbers of middle-class jobs that local employers are trying to fill, such as energy, IT, and advanced manufacturing.Job-Driven Training GrantsThrough the Trade Adjustment Community College and Career Training program more than 1,000 institutions have received $2 billion in federal funding to design education and training programs, working closely with employers and industry that prepare workers for jobs in-demand in their regional economies, such as health care, information technology and energy.
These programs have shown early success -- through the end of FY2013, among the nearly 164,000 individuals who had enrolled in these programs 88 percent either completed a program or continued the program into a second year.Center for the Analysis of Postsecondary ResearchIn August 2014, the Department of Education launched a new Institute for Education Sciences-funded Center for the Analysis of Postsecondary Readiness (CAPR) that is working to strengthen the research, evaluation, and support of college readiness efforts across the nation.
CAPR is documenting current practices in developmental English and math education to identify innovative instructional practices that improve student success.Keeping Costs DownThe President is calling on Congress to advance new reforms to give more hard working students a fair shot at pursuing higher education, because education is not a luxury: it is an economic imperative that every hard working and responsible student should be able to afford.
President Obama has emphasized that the federal government, states, colleges, and universities all have a role to play in making higher education more affordable, byreining in college costs, providing value for American families, and preparing students with a solid education to succeed in their careers.In his State of the Union address, President Obama emphasized this shared responsibility of states and higher education institutions — working with the federal government — to promote access, affordability and attainment in higher education by reining in college costs, providing value for American families, and preparing students with a high quality education to succeed in their careers.
It is not enough to increase federal student aid alone — state policymakers and individual colleges and universities bear a shared responsibility to take action against rising college tuition and costs.Providing greater pathways for students to enter into and succeed in higher education is in the interest of all Americans, and is critical to developing a highly educated, highly skilled economy and workforce that will attract business and lead to lower unemployment.
The Administration has taken several steps and advanced several proposals to put higher education greater within reach for more Americans:Learn MoreReforming student aid to promote affordability and valueTo keep tuition from spiraling too high and drive greater value, the President has proposed reforms to federal campus-based aid programs to shift aid away from colleges that fail to keep net tuition down, and toward those colleges and universities that do their fair share to keep tuition affordable, provide good value, and serve needy students well.
These changes in federal aid to campuses will leverage $10 billion annually to help keep tuition down.Creating a Race to the Top for college affordability and completionThe President has proposed incentives for states to maintain their commitments to higher education through a new $1 billion investment.
The Race to the Top: College Affordability and Completion challenge aims to increase the number of college graduates and contain the cost of tuition by rewarding states that are willing to systematically change their higher education policies and practices.Kicking off a First in the World competitionThe President is proposing an investment of $55 million in a new First in the World competition, to support public and private colleges and non-profit organizations as they work to develop and test the next breakthrough strategy that will boost higher education attainment and student outcome, while leading to reduced costs.Improving Transparency and AccountabilityPresident Obama has consistently strived to lead the most open, efficient and accountable government in history.
Over the last two years, new initiatives have increased public participation in government, opened up new information to Americans on a variety of topics, and improved citizens' everyday lives.
In the vein of transparency and accountability, the President tasked his Administration with giving students and families new tools and relevant information that will help them make sound financial decisions in pursuing their higher education goals.Learn MoreCreating a Financial Aid Shopping SheetThe Department of Education and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have launched the “Know Before You Owe” campaign to create a model financial aid disclosure form — theFinancial Aid Shopping Sheet— to help students better understand the type and amount of aid they qualify for and easily compare aid packages offered by different colleges and universities.
The Financial Aid Shopping Sheet is an individualized standard financial aid award letter that will help students and families understand the costs of college before making the final decision on where to enroll.
The Shopping Sheet is being voluntarily adopted by colleges and universities across the country for the 2013-14 academic year to provide students and families with critical information about their financial decision to attend college in a clear, concise, and standardized format that facilitates easy comparisons across institutions.Launching the College ScorecardAs part of the President's commitment to help students, parents, and their advisers make better college choices, the Department of Education has launched its new College Scorecard to support students and families as they search for and select a college suitable to their academic and career goals.
Thenew College Scorecardis designed with direct input from students, parents, counselors, and others to ensure they have access to  user-friendly, easy-to-understand information on college opportunity, cost, and value.
This tool is built from the most comprehensive and reliable data on all higher education institutions, which for the first time include students' earnings, graduates' debt, and borrowers' repayment rates.
These data are open to the public, making it possible for anyone - student, school, policymaker or researcher - to learn about college performance.
Better information will help students choose where they are likely to learn, graduate, and find jobs.
Better information will help colleges understand how well they are serving their students.
Better information can unite students, parents, advisors, policymakers, and institutions on goals to lower costs and help more students graduate.You can learn more here.Protecting Our Veterans, Military Spouses, and their FamiliesPresident Obama’sExecutive Order Establishing Principles of Excellence for Educational Institutions Serving Service Members, Veterans, Spouses, and Other Family Membersprovides new protections for our nation’s military, veterans, and their families to help ensure they have the information they need to succeed in higher education.
The Principles of Excellence — which will apply to a variety of military and veteran education benefits, including the GI Bill, Tuition Assistance Program, and Military Spouse Career Advancement Account Program (MyCAA) — cracks down on improper online recruiting practices, improve support service, provide better data on educational institutions, and strengthen enforcement of student protections.
The President believes we must do all we can administratively to protect veterans from these deceptive practices by improving the quality of information and services that these schools must provide, and these steps will help ensure that Federal military and veteran education dollars are well spent.View the Icon CreditsRelated VideosOctober 17, 2016 8:51 PMPresident Obama Delivers Remarks on EducationSeptember 08, 2016 4:18 PMFirst Lady Michelle Obama Honors the 2016 Class of the National Student Poets ProgramWHITEHOUSE.GOV IN YOUR INBOXSign up for education updates

As a caretaker, she also spent time playing with Obama and bringing him to and from school, which she continued to do for about two years.
25]In 1970, Soetoro took a new job at higher pay inUnion Oil Company's government relations office.
4][22][26][27][28][29]From January 1970 to August 1972, Obama's mother taught English and was a department head and a director of the Institute of Management Education and Development.
24]Obama attended the Indonesian-language government-runBesuki School, one-and-half miles east in the exclusiveMenteng administrative village, for part of 3rd grade and for 4th grade.
By this time, he had picked up on some Indonesian in addition to his native English.
22]He also joined theCub Scouts.
30]In the summer of 1970, Obama returned to Hawaii for an extended visit with his maternal grandparents,StanleyandMadelyn Dunham.
His mother had also arranged an interview for possible admission to thePunahou Schoolin Honolulu, one of the top private schools in the city.
31]On August 15, 1970, Dunham and Soetoro celebrated the birth of their daughter,Maya Kassandra Soetoro.
32]Return to Hawaii[edit]In mid-1971, Obama moved back to Hawaii to live with his grandparents and attendPunahou Schoolstarting in fifth grade.
33][34]In December 1971, Obama was visited for a month by his father, Barack Obama Sr., from Kenya.
It was the last time Obama would see his father.
This was followed by his mother visiting her son and parents in Honolulu from late 1971 to January 1972.In 1972, Dunham returned to Hawaii, bringing along the young Maya, Obama's half-sister.
Dunham started graduate study in anthropology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
From sixth grade through eighth grade at Punahou, Obama lived with his mother and Maya.
35][36]Obama's mother completed her coursework at the University of Hawaii for an M.A.
in anthropology in December 1974.
37]After three years in Hawaii, she and Maya returned to Jakarta in August 1975,[38]where Dunham completed her contract with the Institute of Management Education and Development and started anthropological fieldwork.
39]Obama chose to stay with his grandparents in Honolulu to continue his studies at Punahou School for his high school years.
His knowledge about his African father, who returned once for a brief visit in 1971, came mainly through family stories and photographs.
41]Of his early childhood, Obama writes: "That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind.
5]The book describes his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of hismultiracialheritage.
42]He wrote that he usedalcohol,marijuana, andcocaineduring his teenage years to "push questions of who I was out of my mind".
43]Obama was also a member of the "choom gang", a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.
44][45]Obama has said that it was a serious mistake.
At the Saddleback Civil Presidential Forum, Barack Obama identified his high-school drug use as his greatest moral failure.
46]Obama has stated he has not used any illegal drugs since he was a teenager.
47]Some of his fellow students attending Punahou School later told theHonolulu Star-Bulletinthat Obama was mature for his age as a high school student and that he sometimes attended parties and other events in order to associate withAfrican Americancollege students and military service people.
Reflecting later on his formative years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: "The opportunity that Hawaii offered—to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect—became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.

49]On February 18, 1981, he made his first public speech, calling for Occidental'sdivestmentfrom South Africa.
49]In the summer of 1981, Obama traveled to Jakarta to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of Occidental College friends inHyderabad (India)andKarachi (Pakistan)for three weeks.
49]He then transferred toColumbia UniversityinNew York City, where he majored inpolitical sciencewith a speciality ininternational relations[50][51]and inEnglish literature.
52]Obama lived off campus in a modest rented apartment at 142 West 109th Street.
53][54]He graduated with aB.A.from Columbia in 1983, then worked atBusiness International CorporationandNew York Public Interest Research Group.
55][56]Early career in Chicago[edit]After four years living in New York, Obama moved to Chicago to work as acommunity organizer.
He worked for three years from June 1985 to May 1988 as director of theDeveloping Communities Project(DCP), a church-based community organization originally comprising eightCatholicparishes in Greater Roseland (Roseland,West Pullman, andRiverdale) on Chicago's farSouth Side.
55][57][58]During his three years as the DCP's director, its staff grew from 1 to 13 and its annual budget grew from $70,000 to $400,000, with accomplishments including helping set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization inAltgeld Gardens.
59]Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for theGamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.
60]In the summer of 1988, he traveled for the first time to Europe for three weeks then to Kenya for five weeks where he met many ofhis paternal relativesfor the first time.
61]Law School[edit]Langdell Hall, home of theHarvard Law SchoollibraryObama enteredHarvard Law Schoolin late 1988.
In an interview withEbonyin 1990, he stated that he saw a degree in law as a vehicle to facilitate better community organization and activism: "The idea was not only to get people to learn how to hope and dream about different possibilities, but to know how the tax structure affects what kind of housing gets built where.
62]At the end of his first year he was selected as an editor of theHarvard Law Reviewbased on his grades and a writing competition.
63]In February 1990, his second year at Harvard, he was elected president of the law review, a full-time volunteer position functioning as editor-in-chief and supervising the law review's staff of 80 editors.
64]Obama's election as the first black president of the law review was widely reported and followed by several long, detailed profiles.
64]He got himself elected by convincing a crucial swing bloc of conservatives that he would protect their interests if they supported him.
Building up that trust was done with the same kind of long listening sessions he had used in the poor neighborhoods of South Side, Chicago.Richard Epstein, who later taught at the University of Chicago Law School when Obama later taught there, said Obama was elected editor "because people on the other side believed he would give them a fair shake.
58][65]While in law school he worked as an associate at the law firmSidley & Austinin 1989, where he met his future wife,Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, and whereNewton N. Minowwas a managing partner.
Minow later would introduce Obama to some of Chicago's top business leaders.
58]In the summer of 1990 he worked atHopkins & Sutter.
66]Also during his law school years, Obama spent eight days in Los Angeles taking a national training course on Alinsky methods of organizing.
58]He graduated with aJ.D.magna cum laudefrom Harvard in 1991 and returned to Chicago.
63]Settling down in Chicago[edit]The publicity from his election as the first African American president of theHarvard Law Reviewled to a contract and advance to write a book about race relations.
67]In an effort to recruit him to their faculty, theUniversity of Chicago Law Schoolprovided Obama with a fellowship and an office to work on his book.
67]He originally planned to finish the book in one year, but it took much longer as the book evolved into a personal memoir.
In order to work without interruptions, Obama and his wife, Michelle, traveled toBaliwhere he wrote for several months.
The manuscript was finally published asDreams from My Fatherin mid-1995.
67]He married Michelle in 1992[68]and settled down with her inHyde Park, a liberal, integrated, middle-class Chicago neighborhood with a history of electing reform-minded politicians independent of the Daley political machine.
69]The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998; their second, Natasha (known as Sasha), in 2001.
70]One effect of the marriage was to bring Obama closer to other politically influential Chicagoans.
One of Michelle's best friends wasJesse Jackson's daughter,Santita Jackson, later the godmother of the Obamas' first child.
Michelle herself had worked as an aide to MayorRichard M. Daley.
Marty Nesbitt, a young, successful black businessman (who played basketball with Michelle's brother,Craig Robinson), became Obama's best friend and introduced him to other African-American business people.
Before the marriage, according to Craig, Obama talked about his political ambitions, even saying that he might run for president someday.
58]Project Vote[edit]Obama directed IllinoisProject Votefrom April to October 1992, a voter registration drive, officially nonpartisan, that helpedCarol Moseley Braunbecome the first black woman ever elected to the Senate.
58]He headed up a staff of 10 and 700 volunteers that achieved its goal of 400,000 registered African Americans in the state, leadingCrain's Chicago Businessto name Obama to its 1993 list of "40 under Forty" powers to be.
71][72][73]Although fundraising was not required for the position when Obama was recruited for the job, he started an active campaign to raise money for the project.
According to Sandy Newman, who founded Project Vote, Obama "raised more money than any of our state directors had ever done.
He did a great job of enlisting a broad spectrum of organizations and people, including many who did not get along well with one another.
73]The fundraising brought Obama into contact with the wealthy, liberal elite of Chicago, some of whom became supporters in his future political career.
Through one of them he metDavid Axelrod, who later headed Obama's campaign for president.
58]The fundraising committee was chaired by John Schmidt, a former chief of staff to MayorRichard M. Daley, and John W. Rogers Jr., a young black money manager and founder of Ariel Capital Management.
73]Obama also met much of the city's black political leadership, although he didn't always get along with the older politicians, with friction sometimes developing over Obama's reluctance to spend money and his insistence on results.
58]"He really did it, and he let other people take all the credit", Schmidt later said.
The people standing up at the press conferences wereJesse JacksonandBobby Rushand I don't know who else.
Barack was off to the side and only the people who were close to it knew he had done all the work.
73]1992–1996[edit]Obama taughtconstitutional lawat theUniversity of Chicago Law Schoolfor twelve years, as a Lecturer for four years (1992–1996), and as a Senior Lecturer for eight years (1996–2004).
74]During this time he taught courses in due process and equal protection, voting rights, and racism and law.
He published no legal scholarship, and turned down tenured positions, but served eight years in the Illinois Senate during his twelve years at the university.
75]In 1993 Obama joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 12-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, thenof counselfrom 1996 to 2004, with his law license becoming inactive in 2007.
55][76]The firm was well known among influential Chicago liberals and leaders of the black community, and the firm's Judson H. Miner, who met with Obama to recruit him before Obama's 1991 graduation from law school, had been counsel to former Chicago MayorHarold Washington, although the law firm often clashed with the administration of MayorRichard M. Daley.
The 29-year-old law student made it clear in his initial interview with Miner that he was more interested in joining the firm to learn about Chicago politics than to practice law.
69]During the four years Obama worked as a full-time lawyer at the firm, he was involved in 30 cases and accrued 3,723 billable hours.
77]Obama was listed as counsel on four cases before theUnited States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
Two of these cases involvedACORNsuing GovernorJim Edgarunder the newMotor Voter Act,[78][79]one involved a voter suing Mayor Daley under theVoting Rights Act,[80]and one involved, in the only case Obama orally argued, awhistleblowingstockbroker suing his former employer.
81]All of these appeals were resolved in favor of Obama's clients, with all the opinions authored by Obama's University of Chicago colleague Chief JudgeRichard Posner.
82]Obama was a founding member of the board of directors ofPublic Alliesin 1992, resigning before his wife, Michelle, became the founding executive director of Public Allies Chicago in early 1993.
55][83]He served on the board of directors of theWoods Fund of Chicago, which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund Obama's DCP, from 1993 to 2002, and served on the board of directors of TheJoyce Foundationfrom 1994 to 2002.
55]Membership on the Joyce and Wood foundation boards, which gave out tens of millions of dollars to various local organizations while Obama was a member, helped Obama get to know and be known by influential liberal groups and cultivate a network of community activists that later supported his political career.
69]Obama served on the board of directors of theChicago Annenberg Challengefrom 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.
55]He also served on the board of directors of theChicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, theCenter for Neighborhood Technology, and the Lugenia Burns Hope Center.
55]In 1995, Obama also announced hiscandidacy for a seat in the Illinois state Senateand attendedLouis Farrakhan'sMillion Man MarchinWashington, DC.

There’s no book on his list more like his evening briefing books. And he’s going to have to sacrifice something. The books total nearly 2,400 pages. At an average speed of one page per minute, the president needs to spend at least four hours a day reading.

While there, he talked to a college student about the importance of education — one of the ideas Obama comes back to often.Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty ImagesNPR is examining what the American dream means to our culture, our economy and our politics.
OnMorning Edition,we'll explore what Republicans think of the American dream.
In this installment, the view from President Obama.The American dream — the idea that in this country anyone can rise from humble beginnings and succeed — is deeply woven into our national psyche.
It's a promise that draws immigrants to our shores.
And it's a staple on the campaign trail.On a campaign-style bus tour last fall, rolling through cotton fields and tobacco farms, President Obama stopped for a cheeseburger and sweet tea in the town of Reidsville, N.C. Shaking hands with a crowd outside the restaurant, Obama paused to offer some fatherly advice to college student Desmond McCowan.
Basically, he told me, be sure I graduated.
Stay in school and be sure I graduated," McCowan said.
It's one thing when your parents tell you, but when the president tells you ...
I'm touched.
I'm touched right now.
Study hard," said the president, whose own mother used to wake him up early to do just that.
The idea that hard work and education pays off is one that Obama often conveys, in words and through his own biography.More In This SeriesAmerican Dreams: Then And NowWe Want To Know: What Is Your American Dream?American Dreams: Then And NowAmerican Dream Faces Harsh New RealityAmerican Dreams: Then And NowOn The Economic Ladder, Rungs Move Further ApartA Living ExampleFrom the moment he burst on the national scene at the 2004 Democratic convention, Obama has served as a living example of the American dream — proof that in this country anyone can succeed, even a skinny black kid with a funny name.
I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story.
That I owe a debt to all of those who came before me," he said.
And that in no other country on Earth is my story even possible.
Obama was quick to add that his story is not one of solo success.
Alongside our famous individualism," he said, "there's another ingredient in the American saga — a belief that we're all connected as one people.
He made that point again this year in a speech at the University of Michigan.
Everybody here is only here because somebody somewhere down the road decided, we're going to think not just about ourselves but about the future.
We've got responsibilities — yes to ourselves, but also to each other.
The Role Of GovernmentThis idea of the American dream as a collective enterprise is what sets Democrats apart from Republicans.
If you look at three basic values that underpin the American dream," says John Kenneth White, a political scientist and editor ofThe American Dream in the 21st Century,"they really are freedom, individual rights — which are closely tied to that — and equality of opportunity.
Republicans typically stress freedom, White says, and they tend to see government as a likely impediment.Democrats like Obama focus on opportunity, and they see a vital role for government.
Somebody who has a great idea in selling a great product or service, we want them to get rich.
That's great.
But we also want to make sure that we as a society are investing in that young kid who comes from a poor family who has incredible talent and might be able to get rich as well," Obama has said.
And that means we've got to build good schools.
And we've got to make sure that that child can go to college.
Obama argues that by training workers, building highways and creating a safety net that enables risk-taking, government helps the free market work.
Opportunity To Everybody'Letreace Grisby, who attended an Obama rally in Virginia this month, likes the idea of the American dream as a cooperative effort.
I don't believe anyone is self-made.
God put us here.
Why not teach, especially these young people, how they can make a better life for themselves?"
she says.
Especially if they were not born in the 1 percent.
Obama seems mindful that his own story could have turned out differently, and he's been determined to hold doors open for others.
He says doing so is good for the country.
I think the history of the United States, the reason we became an economic superpower is because, not always perfectly, not always consistently, but better than any other country on Earth, we were able to give opportunity to everybody," he said.
That's what the American dream was all about.
Obama says preserving that dream requires a balancing act between self-interest and community.
Success is not an entitlement in his book.
But neither is it a reward for individual effort alone.FacebookFlipboardEmailSpecial SeriesAmerican Dreams: Then And NowThis NPR special series explores the state of the American Dream today.Read & ListenHomeNewsCultureMusicPodcasts & ShowsConnectNewslettersFacebookInstagramPressContact & HelpAbout NPROverviewDiversityAccessibilityEthicsFinancesPublic EditorCorrectionsGet InvolvedSupport Public RadioSponsor NPRNPR CareersNPR ShopNPR EventsNPR ExtraTerms of UsePrivacyYour Privacy ChoicesText OnlySponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

A country which endows every man, woman and child with unalienable rights to “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”These are words which we repeat so often, that their depth and relevance today can easily be missed.Any nation which pledges to honor its citizen’s right to “life” should enact and protect laws which ensure high quality and affordable access to the doctors, treatment, and preventative care we need to live full and healthy lives.Any country committed to defending “liberty” should protect our fundamental right as Americans; the right to vote.
Our liberty is dependent upon free and inclusive elections, and our ability to peacefully hold our leaders accountable, while directing the course of our country.
Dr. King was the first to tell us that the “arc of the moral universe is long, but that it bends toward justice.” President Obama went further today, to remind us all that "the arc of the moral universe may bend toward justice, but it doesn't bend on its own.
The right to “pursue happiness” is most secure when we put the education of all of our children, the growth of our economy, the health of our businesses, the creation of jobs, and the stability of our markets ahead of self-interest, and political posturing.
Every American deserves to feel the pride of a hard-earned paycheck, and the opportunity to achieve their dreams, regardless of who they are, or the zip code of their birth.As we reflect on the tremendous progress made over the past half-century, we honor those brave leaders who paved the way, and upon whose shoulders we all stand, by recognizing our responsibility to undertake the immense job still at hand.
This is a time to reaffirm our commitment to the ideals on which America was founded, and to help ensure this country continues to “rise up,” as Dr. King declared 50 years ago, and “live out the true meaning of its creed.”As President Obama traced the steps of giants today, let us also remember the extraordinary things accomplished by the countless ordinary people, who President Obama often calls America’s “quiet heroes.” They are our parents and grandparents; our coworkers, classmates, and neighbors.
They are the men and women in this country who have rolled up their sleeves, and laced up their work boots every day over the past five decades to move this country forward.
Some who marched – others who simply took the early shift, year after year, so they would be home in time to cook dinner for their families before heading to a second job.
Let us remember the many who have faced down violence, despair, and incredible odds, just to give their children a chance at a better life, and our country the chance to live up to its full potential.Today we salute the heroes who inspired us 50 years ago, and we honor the millions more whose blood, sweat, and divine strength have served to define our nation.
We honor them with our reverence, and our willingness to sacrifice for the greater good, and march on.
We honor them with our urgent action to deliver all Americans the rights and opportunities they deserve.
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.
We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.
Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.

Lewis, a civil rights icon and fierce advocate of voting rights for African Americans, died on July 17 at the age of 80.Alyssa Pointer/Pool / Getty Images"I was proud that John Lewis was a friend of mine," former President Barack Obama said on Thursday, delivering an emotional eulogy for the civil rights leader who was an inspiration for America's first Black president.Lewis was a mentor and a hero to him, Obama said in a 40-minute speech.
Speaking from the former pulpit of Dr. Martin Luther Kingat Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Obama praised the late Congress member's commitment to protest and advocacy that drove him onto the Edmund Pettus Bridge and into decades of public service.
He believed that in all of us, there exists the capacity for great courage," Obama said, "that in all of us there is a longing to do what's right, that in all of us there is a willingness to love all people, and to extend to them their God-given rights to dignity and respect.
The two first met when Obama was in law school.
From there, they had encounters at landmark events in Obama's life, from his arrival in the U.S. Senate to his presidential inauguration.
I told him, I'm here because of you," Obama said of talking to Lewis as a congressional colleague.
He was a good and kind and gentle man," Obama said, "and he believed in us, even when we don't believe in ourselves.
YouTubeBelow, the full transcript of Obama's eulogy for Lewis:Remarks of President Barack ObamaEulogy for John LewisEbenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, GeorgiaJuly 30, 2020As DeliveredJames wrote to the believers, "Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.
Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing.
It is a great honor to be back in Ebenezer Baptist Church, in the pulpit of its greatest pastor, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to pay my respects to perhaps his finest disciple – an American whose faith was tested again and again to produce a man of pure joy and unbreakable perseverance – John Robert Lewis.To those who have spoken to Presidents Bush and Clinton, Madam Speaker, Reverend Warnock, Reverend King, John's family, friends, his beloved staff, Mayor Bottoms – I've come here today because I, like so many Americans, owe a great debt to John Lewis and his forceful vision of freedom.Now, this country is a constant work in progress.
We were born with instructions: to form a more perfect union.
Explicit in those words is the idea that we are imperfect; that what gives each new generation purpose is to take up the unfinished work of the last and carry it further than anyone might have thought possible.John Lewis – the first of the Freedom Riders, head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, youngest speaker at the March on Washington, leader of the march from Selma to Montgomery, Member of Congress representing the people of this state and this district for 33 years, mentor to young people, including me at the time, until his final day on this Earth – he not only embraced that responsibility, but he made it his life's work.Which isn't bad for a boy from Troy.
John was born into modest means – that means he was poor – in the heart of the Jim Crow South to parents who picked somebody else's cotton.
Apparently, he didn't take to farm work – on days when he was supposed to help his brothers and sisters with their labor, he'd hide under the porch and make a break for the school bus when it showed up.
His mother, Willie Mae Lewis, nurtured that curiosity in this shy, serious child.
Once you learn something," she told her son, "once you get something inside your head, no one can take it away from you.
As a boy, John listened through the door after bedtime as his father's friends complained about the Klan.
One Sunday as a teenager, he heard Dr. King preach on the radio.
As a college student in Tennessee, he signed up for Jim Lawson's workshops on the tactic of nonviolent civil disobedience.
John Lewis was getting something inside his head, an idea he couldn't shake that took hold of him – that nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience were the means to change laws, but also change hearts, and change minds, and change nations, and change the world.So he helped organize the Nashville campaign in 1960.
He and other young men and women sat at a segregated lunch counter, well-dressed, straight-backed, refusing to let a milkshake poured on their heads, or a cigarette extinguished on their backs, or a foot aimed at their ribs, refused to let that dent their dignity and their sense of purpose.
And after a few months, the Nashville campaign achieved the first successful desegregation of public facilities in any major city in the South.John got a taste of jail for the first, second, third ... well, several times.
But he also got a taste of victory.
And it consumed him with righteous purpose.
And he took the battle deeper into the South.That same year, just weeks after the Supreme Court ruled that segregation of interstate bus facilities was unconstitutional, John and Bernard Lafayette bought two tickets, climbed aboard a Greyhound, sat up front, and refused to move.
This was months before the first official Freedom Rides.
He was doing a test.
The trip was unsanctioned.
Few knew what they were up to.
And at every stop, through the night, apparently the angry driver stormed out of the bus and into the bus station.
And John and Bernard had no idea what he might come back with or who he might come back with.
Nobody was there to protect them.
There were no camera crews to record events.
You know, sometimes, we read about this and kind of take it for granted.
Or at least we act as if it was inevitable.
Imagine the courage of two people Malia's age, younger than my oldest daughter, on their own, to challenge an entire infrastructure of oppression.John was only twenty years old.
But he pushed all twenty of those years to the center of the table, betting everything, all of it, that his example could challenge centuries of convention, and generations of brutal violence, and countless daily indignities suffered by African Americans.Like John the Baptist preparing the way, like those Old Testament prophets speaking truth to kings, John Lewis did not hesitate – he kept on getting on board buses and sitting at lunch counters, got his mugshot taken again and again, marched again and again on a mission to change America.Spoke to a quarter million people at the March on Washington when he was just 23.Helped organize the Freedom Summer in Mississippi when he was just 24.At the ripe old age of 25, John was asked to lead the march from Selma to Montgomery.
He was warned that Governor Wallace had ordered troopers to use violence.
But he and Hosea Williams and others led them across that bridge anyway.
And we've all seen the film and the footage and the photographs, and President Clinton mentioned the trench coat, the knapsack, the book to read, the apple to eat, the toothbrush – apparently jails weren't big on such creature comforts.
And you look at those pictures and John looks so young and he's small in stature.
Looking every bit that shy, serious child that his mother had raised and yet, he is full of purpose.
God's put perserverence in him.And we know what happened to the marchers that day.
Their bones were cracked by billy clubs, their eyes and lungs choked with tear gas.
As they knelt to pray, which made their heads even easier targets, and John was struck in the skull.
And he thought he was going to die, surrounded by the sight of young Americans gagging, and bleeding, and trampled, victims in their own country of state-sponsored violence.And the thing is, I imagine initially that day, the troopers thought that they had won the battle.
You can imagine the conversations they had afterwards.
You can imagine them saying, "yeah, we showed them."
They figured they'd turned the protesters back over the bridge; that they'd kept, that they'd preserved a system that denied the basic humanity of their fellow citizens.
Except this time, there were some cameras there.
This time, the world saw what happened, bore witness to Black Americans who were asking for nothing more than to be treated like other Americans.
Who were not asking for special treatment, just the equal treatment promised to them a century before, and almost another century before that.When John woke up, and checked himself out of the hospital, he would make sure the world saw a movement that was, in the words of Scripture, "hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed."
They returned to Brown Chapel, a battered prophet, bandages around his head, and he said more marchers will come now.
And the people came.
And the troopers parted.
And the marchers reached Montgomery.
And their words reached the White House – and Lyndon Johnson, son of the South, said "We shall overcome," and the Voting Rights Act was signed into law.The life of John Lewis was, in so many ways, exceptional.
It vindicated the faith in our founding, redeemed that faith; that most American of ideas; that idea that any of us ordinary people without rank or wealth or title or fame can somehow point out the imperfections of this nation, and come together, and challenge the status quo, and decide that it is in our power to remake this country that we love until it more closely aligns with our highest ideals.
What a radical ideal.
What a revolutionary notion.
This idea that any of us, ordinary people, a young kid from Troy can stand up to the powers and principalities and say no this isn't right, this isn't true, this isn't just.
We can do better.
On the battlefield of justice, Americans like John, Americans like the Reverends Lowery and C.T.
Vivian, two other patriots that we lost this year, liberated all of us that many Americans came to take for granted.America was built by people like them.
America was built by John Lewises.
He as much as anyone in our history brought this country a little bit closer to our highest ideals.
And someday, when we do finish that long journey toward freedom; when we do form a more perfect union – whether it's years from now, or decades, or even if it takes another two centuries – John Lewis will be a founding father of that fuller, fairer, better America.And yet, as exceptional as John was, here's the thing: John never believed that what he did was more than any citizen of this country can do.
I mentioned in the statement the day John passed, the thing about John was just how gentle and humble he was.
And despite this storied, remarkable career, he treated everyone with kindness and respect because it was innate to him – this idea that any of us can do what he did if we are willing to persevere.He believed that in all of us, there exists the capacity for great courage, that in all of us there is a longing to do what's right, that in all of us there is a willingness to love all people, and to extend to them their God-given rights to dignity and respect.
So many of us lose that sense.
It's taught out of us.
We start feeling as if, in fact, that we can't afford to extend kindness or decency to other people.
That we're better off if we are above other people and looking down on them, and so often that's encouraged in our culture.
But John always saw the best in us.
And he never gave up, and never stopped speaking out because he saw the best in us.
He believed in us even when we didn't believe in ourselves.
As a Congressman, he didn't rest; he kept getting himself arrested.
As an old man, he didn't sit out any fight; he sat in, all night long, on the floor of the United States Capitol.
I know his staff was stressed.But the testing of his faith produced perseverance.
He knew that the march is not yet over, that the race is not yet won, that we have not yet reached that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character.
He knew from his own life that progress is fragile; that we have to be vigilant against the darker currents of this country's history, of our own history, with their whirlpools of violence and hatred and despair that can always rise again.Bull Connor may be gone.
But today we witness with our own eyes police officers kneeling on the necks of Black Americans.
George Wallace may be gone.
But we can witness our federal government sending agents to use tear gas and batons against peaceful demonstrators.
We may no longer have to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar in order to cast a ballot.
But even as we sit here, there are those in power are doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting – by closing polling locations, and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws, and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the postal service in the runup to an election that is going to be dependent on mailed-in ballots so people don't get sick.Now, I know this is a celebration of John's life.
There are some who might say we shouldn't dwell on such things.
But that's why I'm talking about it.
John Lewis devoted his time on this Earth fighting the very attacks on democracy and what's best in America that we are seeing circulate right now.He knew that every single one of us has a God-given power.
And that the fate of this democracy depends on how we use it; that democracy isn't automatic, it has to be nurtured, it has to be tended to, we have to work at it, it's hard.
And so he knew it depends on whether we summon a measure, just a measure, of John's moral courage to question what's right and what's wrong and call things as they are.
He said that as long as he had breath in his body, he would do everything he could to preserve this democracy.
That as long as we have breath in our bodies, we have to continue his cause.
If we want our children to grow up in a democracy – not just with elections, but a true democracy, a representative democracy, a big-hearted, tolerant, vibrant, inclusive America of perpetual self-creation – then we are going to have to be more like John.
We don't have to do all the things he had to do because he did them for us.
But we have got to do something.
As the Lord instructed Paul, "Do not be afraid, go on speaking; do not be silent, for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many in this city who are my people."
Just everybody's just got to come out and vote.
We've got all those people in the city but we can't do nothing.Like John, we have got to keep getting into that good trouble.
He knew that nonviolent protest is patriotic; a way to raise public awareness, put a spotlight on injustice, and make the powers that be uncomfortable.Like John, we don't have to choose between protest and politics, it is not an either-or situation, it is a both-and situation.
We have to engage in protests where that is effective but we also have to translate our passion and our causes into laws and institutional practices.
That's why John ran for Congress thirty-four years ago.Like John, we have got to fight even harder for the most powerful tool we have, which is the right to vote.
The Voting Rights Act is one of the crowning achievements of our democracy.
It's why John crossed that bridge.
It's why he spilled his blood.
And by the way, it was the result of Democratic and Republican efforts.
President Bush, who spoke here earlier, and his father, both signed its renewal when they were in office.
President Clinton didn't have to because it was the law when he arrived so instead he made a law that made it easier for people to register to vote.But once the Supreme Court weakened the Voting Rights Act, some state legislatures unleashed a flood of laws designed specifically to make voting harder, especially, by the way, state legislatures where there is a lot of minority turnout and population growth.
That's not necessarily a mystery or an accident.
It was an attack on what John fought for.
It was an attack on our democratic freedoms.
And we should treat it as such.If politicians want to honor John, and I'm so grateful for the legacy of work of all the Congressional leaders who are here, but there's a better way than a statement calling him a hero.
You want to honor John?
Let's honor him by revitalizing the law that he was willing to die for.
And by the way, naming it the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, that is a fine tribute.
But John wouldn't want us to stop there, trying to get back to where we already were.
Once we pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, we should keep marching to make it even better.By making sure every American is automatically registered to vote, including former inmates who've earned their second chance.By adding polling places, and expanding early voting, and making Election Day a national holiday, so if you are someone who is working in a factory, or you are a single mom who has got to go to her job and doesn't get time off, you can still cast your ballot.By guaranteeing that every American citizen has equal representation in our government, including the American citizens who live in Washington, D.C. and in Puerto Rico.
They are Americans.By ending some of the partisan gerrymandering– so that all voters have the power to choose their politicians, not the other way around.And if all this takes eliminating the filibuster – another Jim Crow relic – in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that's what we should do.And yet, even if we do all this – even if every bogus voter suppression law was struck off the books today – we have got to be honest with ourselves that too many of us choose not to exercise the franchise; that too many of our citizens believe their vote won't make a difference, or they buy into the cynicism that, by the way, is the central strategy of voter suppression, to make you discouraged, to stop believing in your own power.So we are also going to have to remember what John said: "If you don't do everything you can to change things, then they will remain the same.
You only pass this way once.
You have to give it all you have."
As long as young people are protesting in the streets, hoping real change takes hold, I'm hopeful but we cannot casually abandon them at the ballot box.
Not when few elections have been as urgent, on so many levels, as this one.
We cannot treat voting as an errand to run if we have some time.
We have to treat it as the most important action we can take on behalf of democracy.Like John, we have to give it all we have.I was proud that John Lewis was a friend of mine.
I met him when I was in law school.
He came to speak and I went up and I said, "Mr. Lewis, you are one of my heroes.
What inspired me more than anything as a young man was to see what you and Reverend Lawson and Bob Moses and Diane Nash and others did."
And he got that kind of – aw shucks, thank you very much.The next time I saw him, I had been elected to the United States Senate.
And I told him, "John, I am here because of you."
On Inauguration Day in 2008, 2009, he was one of the first people that I greeted and hugged on that stand.
I told him, "This is your day too.
He was a good and kind and gentle man.
And he believed in us – even when we don't believe in ourselves.
It's fitting that the last time John and I shared a public forum was on Zoom.
I am pretty sure that neither he nor I set up the Zoom call because we didn't know how to work it.
It was a virtual town hall with a gathering of young activists who had been helping to lead this summer's demonstrations in the wake of George Floyd's death.
And afterwards, I spoke to John privately, and he could not have been prouder to see this new generation of activists standing up for freedom and equality; a new generation that was intent on voting and protecting the right to vote; in some cases, a new generation running for political office.I told him, all those young people, John – of every race and every religion, from every background and gender and sexual orientation – John, those are your children.
They learned from your example, even if they didn't always know it.
They had understood, through him, what American citizenship requires, even if they had only heard about his courage through the history books.
By the thousands, faceless, anonymous, relentless young people, black and white...have taken our whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in the formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence."Dr.
King said that in the 1960s.
And it came true again this summer.We see it outside our windows, in big cities and rural towns, in men and women, young and old, straight Americans and LGBTQ Americans, Blacks who long for equal treatment and whites who can no longer accept freedom for themselves while witnessing the subjugation of their fellow Americans.
We see it in everybody doing the hard work of overcoming complacency, of overcoming our own fears and our own prejudices, our own hatreds.
You see it in people trying to be better, truer versions of ourselves.And that's what John Lewis teaches us.
That's where real courage comes from.
Not from turning on each other, but by turning towards one another.
Not by sowing hatred and division, but by spreading love and truth.
Not by avoiding our responsibilities to create a better America and a better world, but by embracing those responsibilities with with joy and perseverance and discovering that in our beloved community, we do not walk alone.What a gift John Lewis was.
We are all so lucky to have had him walk with us for a while, and show us the way.God bless you all.
God bless America.

And like Lincoln, Obama didn't win every election he ever contested — only the most important one, in 2008, when he became the first African-American President of the United States.He made his own story the foundation of his campaign — raised in Hawaii by a single-mother from the midwest, a father from Kenya, and several years spent in Indonesia — a story that could only happen in America.
He was inaugurated the 44th President of the United States —for the first time— on January 20, 2009, before record numbers of people, both present the Washington Mall as well as on TV worldwide.
notfakenewsThe world was full of hope, then.
Change was in the air.
Nine months later, Barack Obama made history again, this time as the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.Obama's eight years in office were replete with historic accomplishments: legalizing gay marriage, establishing an affordable healthcare system, and creating programs to fight climate change, to name a few.
But his greatest and perhaps most easily forgotten accomplishment was preventing a second Great Depression.He entered the Oval Office just as the US economy was being taken down by the collapse of the global banking system.
He came into office at the eve of one of the most economically and socially unstable moments in American history, and he managed to stave off the worst of it, while spreading the message of hope and change to millions of people.
Today, the strength of the US economy ishislegacy.Obama left the presidency at noon on January 20, 2017, handing over the reins to a man who is his opposite in every conceivable way.
The former US President still is a symbol of hope for people everywhere.
He gave Americans a future to believe in at a time of crisis.
History will remember him kindly.Happy Birthday Mr. President!Many thanks to Harper Lower and all the other individuals who nominated Barack Hussein Obama to the #HistoryHero BLAST.
To day, he is the most frequently figure in this Time Traveler Tours campaign.“I see Americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe that we are stronger together: black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American; young, old; gay, straight; men, women, folks with disabilities, all pledging allegiance under the same proud flag to this big, bold country that we love.

This bipartisan measure
reauthorizes the 50-year-old Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), the nation’s national education law and longstanding commitment to equal opportunity for all
students.The new law builds on key areas of progress in recent years, made possible by the efforts of educators, communities, parents, and students across the country.For example, today, high school graduation rates are at all-time highs.
Dropout rates are at historic lows.
And more students are going to college than ever before.
These achievements provide a firm foundation for further work to expand educational opportunity and improve student outcomes under ESSA.The previous version of the law, the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, was enacted in 2002.
NCLB represented a significant step forward for our nation’s children in
many respects, particularly as it shined a light on where students were making progress and where they needed additional support, regardless of race, income, zip code,
disability, home language, or background.
The law was scheduled for revision in 2007, and, over time, NCLB’s prescriptive requirements became increasingly unworkable
for schools and educators.
Recognizing this fact, in 2010, the Obama administration joined a call from educators and families to create a better law that focused on the
clear goal of fully preparing all students for success in college and careers.Congress has now responded to that call.The Every Student Succeeds Act reflects many of the priorities of this administration.ESSA HighlightsPresident Obama signs the Every Student Succeeds Act into law on December 10, 2015.ESSA includes provisions that will help to ensure success for students and schools.
Below are just a few.
The law:Advances equity by upholding critical protections for America's disadvantaged and high-need students.Requires—for the first time—that all students in America be taught to high academic standards that will prepare them to succeed in college and careers.Ensures that vital information is provided to educators, families, students, and communities through annual statewide assessments that measure students'
progress toward those high standards.Helps to support and grow local innovations—including evidence-based and place-based interventions developed by local leaders and educators—consistent with
ourInvesting in InnovationandPromise NeighborhoodsSustains and expands this administration's historic investments in increasing access to high-qualitypreschool.Maintains an expectation that there will be accountability and action to effect positive change in our lowest-performing schools, where groups of students
are not making progress, and where graduation rates are low over extended periods of time.History of ESEAThe Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was signed into law in 1965 by President Lyndon Baines Johnson, who believed that "full educational opportunity"
should be "our first national goal."
From its inception, ESEA was a civil rights law.ESEA offered new grants to districts serving low-income students, federal grants for textbooks and library books, funding for special education centers, and
scholarships for low-income college students.
Additionally, the law provided federal grants to state educational agencies to improve the quality of elementary and
secondary education.NCLB and AccountabilityNCLB put in place measures that exposed achievement gaps among traditionally underserved students and their peers and spurred an important national dialogue on
education improvement.
This focus on accountability has been critical in ensuring a quality education for all children, yet also revealed challenges in the effective
implementation of this goal.Parents, educators, and elected officials across the country recognized that a strong, updated law was necessary to expand opportunity to all students; support
schools, teachers, and principals; and to strengthen our education system and economy.In 2012, the Obama administration began granting flexibility to states regarding specific requirements of NCLB in exchange for rigorous and comprehensive state-
developed plans designed to close achievement gaps, increase equity, improve the quality of instruction, and increase outcomes for all students.What's Next?Over the next few weeks, the U.S. Department of Education will work with states and districts to begin implementing the new law.

ESTPRESIDENT OBAMA:  Greetings, massive!
Laughter and applause.)
Wah gwaan, Jamaica?
Applause.)
Can everybody please give Aubrey a big round of applause for the great introduction?
I want to thank the University of the West Indies for hosting us.
Big up, You-Wee!
Thank you.
I’ve been making myself at home here.
Laughter.
It is great to be in beautiful Jamaica -- not only because I’m proud to be the first President of the United States to visit in more than 30 years, but because I just like the vibe here.
I was born on an island, and it was warm, and so I feel right at home.And I’m grateful for the warm Jamaican hospitality that I received this morning, including from Prime Minister Simpson-Miller.
I also had the chance to meet with leaders from across the Caribbean, where we focused on issues of shared prosperity and shared security.
And tomorrow, I’ll meet with leaders from across the hemisphere at the Summit of the Americas in Panama.But before my trip became all business, I wanted to come here and hear from young people like you.
Because it is your generation who will shape the future of our countries and our region and this planet that we share long after those of us who are currently in public service are gone from the stage.
So I’m going to only speak for a few minutes at the top, because I’d rather spend time taking questions from you, and also because after we have a chance for our town hall, I get a chance to say hi to Usain Bolt and Shelly Ann Fraser-Pryce.
When you have the fastest people on the planet, you’ve got to say hi to them, right?
Because that’s fast.
Laughter.)
There are a lot of people out there, and they’re the fastest.Now, we are not just nations, we’re also neighbors.
Tens of millions of Americans are bound to the Caribbean and the Americas through ties of commerce, but also ties of kin.
More than one million Americans trace their ancestry to Jamaica.
More than one million Americans visit Jamaica each year.
So we’re committed to you and this region.
And as I’ve said before, in our foreign policy there are no senior or junior partners in the Americas; there are just partners.And that’s one reason why the United States has started a new chapter in our relations with the people of Cuba.
We will continue to have some differences with the Cuban government, but we don’t want to be imprisoned by the past.
When something doesn’t work for 50 years, you don’t just keep on doing it; you try something new.
And we are as committed as ever to supporting human rights and political freedom in Cuba and around the world.
But I believe that engagement is a more powerful force than isolation, and the changes we are making can help improve the lives of the Cuban people.
And I also believe that this new beginning will be good for the United States and the entire hemisphere.My point is, I believe we can move past some of the old debates that so often define the region, and move forward in a way that benefits your generation with new thinking -- an energetic, impatient, dynamic and diverse generation that you represent, both in the United States and across this hemisphere.
More than 100 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean are between the ages of 15 and 24.
Most of the region is under 35.And what gives me so much hope about your generation is that you’re more interested in the hard work of waging peace than resorting to the quick impulses of conflict.
You’re more interested in the hard work of building prosperity through entrepreneurship, not cronyism or corruption.
You’re more eager for progress that comes not by holding down any segment of society, but by holding up the rights of every human being, regardless of what we look like, or how we pray, or who we love.You care less about the world as it has been, and more about the world as it should be and can be.
And unlike any other time in our history, the technology at your disposal means that you don’t have to wait for the change that you’re looking for; you have the freedom to create it in your own in powerful and disruptive ways.
Many of you already have, whether by starting your own enterprises or by helping others start theirs.And I’m going to just single out two remarkable young leaders who are here today because I think they’re an example of what is possible, even in the most difficult of circumstances.So Angeline Jackson is here today.
Where is Angeline?
There she is, right there.
Applause.
Several years ago, when Angeline was 19, she and a friend were kidnapped, held at gunpoint and sexually assaulted.
And as a woman, and as a lesbian, justice and society were not always on her side.
But instead of remaining silent, she chose to speak out and started her own organization to advocate for women like her, and get them treatment and get them justice, and push back against stereotypes, and give them some sense of their own power.And she became a global activist.
But more than anything, she cares about her Jamaica, and making it a place where everybody, no matter their color, or their class, or their sexual orientation, can live in equality and opportunity.
That’s the power of one person, what they can do.
Jerome Cowans grew up in a tough part of Kingston.
Where’s Jerome?
When Jerome was 12, he saw a friend gunned down.
And when he looked at the shooters, he said, “I realized that wasn’t a life I wanted to live.
They had expensive machinery, but they had nothing else.”  So at the ripe old age of 13, he founded a youth group to help others like him stay on the right path.
And he started small, with only six people, but they had one big thing in common and they believed that change was possible.And like Angeline, he was threatened for his work, but he kept at it.
And he said, “Things won’t get any better if no one does anything.”  And today, the LEAD Youth Club he started has six chapters, including one in Colombia.
His work has taken him to five continents.
Last year, he became the first Jamaican to receive the Nelson Mandela Innovation Award.
He’s just 25 years old.
So individuals like those two young people -- the young people here today -- you remind me of something that Bob Marley once said.
You know I went to his house yesterday.
I thought, I'm only five minutes from his house, I got to go check it out.
And one of the displays has to do when he was shot right before a concert he was supposed to give, trying to bring the political factions in Jamaica together.
And he was treated for his wounds and he went ahead with the program, went ahead with the show.
And somebody asked, well, why would you do that?
He said, “The people who are trying to make this world worse are not taking the day off.
Why should I?”  Why should I?
So none of us can afford to take the day off.
And I want you to have every chance, every tool you need to make this world better.
So today I’m announcing nearly $70 million in U.S. investments in education, training, and employment programs for our young people throughout Latin America and the Caribbean.
And these investments will help young people in unemployed and impoverished and marginalized communities, and give them a chance to gain the skills they need to compete and succeed in the 21st century economy.And that’s not all.
As President, some of the initiatives I’m most proud of are ones that increase my country’s engagement with the next generation of leaders like Angeline and Jerome and all of you -- leaders in government and civil society, and entrepreneurship and the private sector.
Four years ago, I launched an initiative called “100,000 Strong in the Americas.”  And the goal was to have 100,000 U.S. students studying in this region, and 100,000 of this region’s students studying in the United States by the end of this decade.
And we are on track to meet that goal.So today, to build on that progress, I’m proud to launch the Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative right here in Kingston.
Let me say this.
This is not your traditional exchange.
We’re going to seek out the most innovative young entrepreneurs and civil society leaders in the Caribbean, Latin America, and we're going to give them a chance to earn a substantial continuum of the training and the resources and the connections, the networks and the capital that you need to make a difference.So this year, we’ll bring two dozen entrepreneurs and civil society leaders from Latin America and the Caribbean -- including young Cuban leaders -- to the United States.
Then next year, we’ll increase this fellowship to 250 young leaders.
And we’ll help you to expand your commercial and social ventures; we'll embed you in an American business and incubators.
We’ll give U.S. participants the chance to continue their collaboration with you in your home countries.So the idea is that you’ll get a chance to implement your ideas but now have linkages that give you access to capital and research and all the things you need to mobilize and implement the kinds of things that you're doing.And this isn't charity for us.
This is an investment in your future, because that means it's an investment in our future -- a future where climate researchers in the Amazon can collaborate with scientists in Alaska.
An idea in Barbados suddenly can be developed in an incubator in Boston.
Anti-gang activities in Honduras can be connected to similar activities in Houston, Texas.
It’s a future where any kid from Kingston can choose a path that opens his or her horizons beyond their neighborhood to the wider world.
And that impulse to make the world better, to push back on those who try to make it worse, that’s something that your generation has to hold on to.
And you have to remember, it’s never easy; there are no days off.
But if there’s one thing that I know from my own life, it’s that with hard work and with hope, change is always within our reach.The Jamaican-American poet Claude McKay, who was a central figure of the Harlem renaissance, once wrote something along those lines:  “We must strive on to gain the height although it may not be in sight.”  As long as we’ve got young strivers like you -- and I hope to see you in Washington as part of this Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative -- I’m confident that a brighter future will always be in sight.So thank you very much.
With that, let’s take some questions.
All right, since we’re getting to work I’m going to take my jacket off and get comfortable.
All right.
There are no rules to this except that there are people with microphones in the audience, so wait for them to come when I call on you.
We’re going to go boy, girl, boy, girl so everybody gets a chance, so it’s fair.
Before your question, please introduce yourself and tell us where you are from, okay?
And try to keep your question or comment relatively short so we can get more questions or comments in, okay?
We’ll start with this young lady right here in the white blouse.
It’s a little tight here.Q    Thank you.
Yani Campbell (ph), a lecturer at the University of the West Indies.
Thank you so much for your talk, very interesting.
And I wondered as well, on the Cuban issue, now that your policy has actually changed towards Cuba, I wondered about your views on how it is that we should approach -- CARICOM should approach its relationship with Cuba in terms of deepening that relationship.
Should they now perhaps move to join in CARICOM?
Thank you.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, first of all, I think CARICOM can make its own decisions and we’ll respect it.
Cuba will be participating in the Summit of the Americas, and I think -- it is my strong belief that if we engage, that that offers the greatest prospect for escaping some of the constraints of the past.I think the Cuban people are extraordinary and have huge potential.
And what’s encouraging is, is that the overwhelming majority of Cubans are interested in ending the Cold War -- the last vestige of the Cold War -- and moving forward.
It’s going to take some time for the United States to fully implement some of the things that have already been agreed to, and it’s going to take a little bit longer before you actually have complete normal relations between the United States and Cuba.What I would say to Caribbean countries is, absolutely, you should continue to engage in Cuba in the ways that you’ve already doing -- you’ve already done in the past.
I do think that it is important for all of us to be able to speak honestly where we see concerns about issues of human rights and political freedom.
And I’m not saying anything publicly that I haven’t said directly to Raul Castro.
There are still constraints on the ability of the Cuban people to express themselves, or to organize political parties, or to start a business.
And sometimes, the same things we expect for ourselves and our country, somehow we think other people don’t want.But I believe that each country -- I believe each country has its own unique cultures, its own unique traditions.
I don’t expect every country to pursue the same policies or have the same political practices as the United States.
And I am certainly aware of the flaws that exist in our own country that we have to fix.
But I do believe there are certain principles that are universal.
I think that all people want basic dignity and want basic freedom, and want to be able to worship as they please without being discriminated against, or they should be able to speak their mind about an important issue pertaining to their community without being arrested.
And so wherever we see that, we try to speak out.But what we also try to do is engage and recognize that even with countries that we have differences, there’s also going to be commonality and overlap.
And the United States and Cuba should both have an interest in dealing with climate change, for example, because when the oceans start lapping upon Miami or on Havana, nobody is going to distinguish, well, where do they stand on this or that ideological issue.
And so we have to find where there are areas of cooperation, but I will continue to try to be consistent in speaking out on behalf of the issues that are important to all people, not just some.All right, it’s a gentleman’s turn.
This gentleman right here.
He looks very serious; he’s got glasses.
Looking sharp.
Plus, he’s got a copy of my book.
So he’s clearly a wise man.Q    Thank you very much.
My name is Chef Brian Lumley -- I’m a young Jamaican chef here.
And I own a restaurant -- 689 by Brian Lumley.
Just saying.My question to you -- I’m going to stay a little bit off the politics for a bit.
And I’ve witnessed your journey a lot, and the question is kind of two-part.
If you go back and give yourself one piece of advice before the start of you 2008 term, what would it be?
And the second part is if you can sign this book when you’re finished.
Thank you very much.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  I’ll sign the book.
So the question was, for those couldn’t hear:  If I were to go back and give myself advice before I started in 2008, what would the advice be?I suppose I could have started dying my hair earlier -- (laughter) -- so then people wouldn’t say, man, he’s getting old.
You’re going like this -- at least I got hair, man.
I’m teasing you.
I’m messing with you.I think that -- keep in mind that when I came into office we were going through the worst global financial crisis since the 1930s, and so we had to make a series of decisions very quickly, many of which were unpopular.
Overall, I think we got it right.
I think we did the right thing.
And because, I think, we took these steps, not only were we able to avoid the kind of Great Depression that we saw in the 1930s, not only was America able to bounce back and start growing more rapidly than most of our peers, drive down unemployment faster, create more jobs faster, but that also had an impact on the global economy and it had an impact on the Caribbean economy, that we were able to bounce back quicker than we might have if we hadn't taken those steps.But it was, I think, costly politically.
And what I would have probably advised was that I might have needed to warn the American people and paint a picture for them that was more accurate about the fact that it would take some time to dig ourselves out of a very big hole.
Because FDR, when he came into office, the Great Depression had already been going on for two, three years, and so people understood how serious it was.
With us, we came in just as people were really starting to feel the impacts.
And trying to paint a picture that we'll make it but it's going to take some time, and here are the steps that we need to take -- I think I would have advised myself to do a better job spending more time not just getting the policy right, but also describing it in ways that people understood, that gave them confidence in their own future.
I think that would probably be the most important advice that I would have given myself.
All right, it's a young lady’s turn.
That young lady right there.
Yes, you.
You, yes.
Oh, well, I'll call on both of you.
I'll call on you later.
Go ahead.Q    Okay, so we're here and we’re looking at you, and we're all very honored to be here and very taken about by your leadership qualities.
And seeing that you are the President of the United States of America and you’re so influential, I want to know how you handle the mental strain that comes with being in charge of so much.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  What’s your name?Q    Kimberly -- from the University of the West Indies.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Fantastic.
How do I handle stress?
You know, I'll be honest with you.
One of the things that happens as you get older is you start appreciating both your strengths and your weaknesses.
Hopefully you gain a little wisdom about what you're good at and what you're not.
And Michelle can give you a long list of things I'm not good at.
But one thing that I've always had, which has served me well, is a pretty good temperament.
And I attribute that partly from growing up on an island with trade winds and beaches, and it makes you calm.
But I try not to get too high when things are going well so that I don't get too low when things are going badly, and try to keep a long view of how the process of social change takes place, and how the trajectory of your own life is going to proceed.We get caught up in the day-to-day so much, and it’s interesting now when I’m talking to my daughters and “somebody said something at school,” or there’s -- “well, I didn’t do quite as well on that test as I wanted.”  And you want them to take it seriously, but you also want to say to them, you know what, this, too, shall pass; I promise you three months from now, much less 30 years from now, you will not remember.And so I think that trying to keep your eye on the prize of where it is that you want to go and not be discouraged or overly impressed with yourself on a day-to-day basis I think is very important.
And then you have to get some exercise in the morning.
I don’t run as fast as these folks, but I get a little exercise, which does help in terms of stress relief.All right.
It’s a gentleman’s turn.
Let’s see, somebody from this side.
This young man right here in the sharp-looking checkered shirt.Q    Good afternoon again, Mr. President.
Especially as it relates to human rights and social change -- I’m Jomain McKenzie and I’m a focal point with the Global Fund Board.
As it relates to human rights and social change, how do you make the decision to allow societies to go through the natural evolutionary process of having change occur on their own versus having governments exert policies to make these same political social changes?PRESIDENT OBAMA:  That’s a really interesting question.
It’s an interesting question and it’s one that I have to struggle with all the time.Every society, as I said, is at a different phase in development, in their own history; they have different cultural traditions.
And so the way I think about it is, is that the United States has certain core values and principles that we believe deeply in.
And we don’t necessarily expect that every country will formulate how to secure those ideals and those principles.
We don’t expect it to be done exactly as we do any more than we expect every -- obviously, our democracy is not the same as a Jamaican democracy or a British democracy or Australian democracy.
But we believe in democracy.
We think that if people have the ability to speak out about their own lives, some sense of agency, then that society will be stronger.
And that doesn’t mean that we won’t work with a country that doesn’t precisely abide by those principles, but we will still speak out.There are times where a country is clearly engaging in activities that are so egregious that it’s not culturally specific; it typically has to do with a government wanting to exert control over people and oppress them.
And in those instances, I think it is entirely appropriate for us to speak out forcibly and, in some cases, to not do business with them.Look at a country like North Korea.
I mean, obviously, Korean culture is different than American culture.
On the other hand, you look at what’s happening in South Korea and you look at what’s happening in North Korea and those are two entirely different societies.
And I can tell you which one you’d rather live in.And if you have a situation in which people are being murdered simply because they didn’t agree with the government on something or didn’t want their economic fate to be entirely determined by the whims of some government bureaucrat, and suddenly they’re sent to a labor camp -- that’s something where we as an international community have to speak out on.And then there are some issues that may be culturally specific, but you know what, I think they’re wrong.
I won’t -- we’re not going to try to force that country to change, but I may try to shame that country.
There are nations where slavery still exists.
And that may be part of the ancient culture in that society, but slavery is wrong.
And I’m not going to give them the excuse that, well, this is who we are.In Africa -- and I can speak I think fairly as somebody who is the son of an African father -- there are practices like female genital mutilation that may be part of the tradition there, but it’s wrong.
And I’m going to say so.
And it will be U.S. policy to say that it’s wrong.So the tools we use to try to bring about change around the world may vary.
And as I said earlier, we’re not always perfectly consistent.
There are times where we’ve got allies who are not observing all the human rights we would like, and there are times where there are countries that are adversaries of ours where they do some things quite well.
And you can’t expect us, or any country, to be perfectly consistent in every circumstance.
But what I’ve tried to do is be fairly consistent in terms of what we believe, what we stand for, and then we use different tools depending on what we think will bring about the most change.
In some cases, it will just be a diplomatic statement; in some cases, it may be serious enough that we will organize -- try to organize the United Nations or other multilateral forums to speak out against certain practices.
In some cases, it may be so egregious that we need to sanction them, and we will try to organize the international community in that way.And then finally, in the ultimate circumstance, where the violations of our values are so severe that they start spilling over and -- in the instance of, for example, genocide -- we may be say to ourselves, in concert with the international community, we need to intervene because this government is so brutal and so unacceptable that we need to protect people.
But we do that in the context of an international conversation so that we’re not simply making these decisions -- or we’re not so arrogant that we’re not paying attention to what the rest of the world community is saying.This young lady who I originally had called on and got skipped over.
No, no, this one right here.
Yes.
Right here.
I’m sorry, I love you, too, though.
Q    Good afternoon, Mr. President.
My name is Katrina King-Smith.
I’m from the Turks and Caicos Islands.
My question is two-part, as well.
Firstly, in countries such as the Turks and Caicos Islands where the population is small and our main sources of revenue are tourism and foreign direct investment, I was wondering if you can suggest two ways that the government may better generate and regulate sustainable revenue, especially with regulations currently being put in place to close off-shore financial centers.And secondly, I was wondering if after your term has ended, would you mind coming to the Turks and Caicos to vacation?
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  On the second question, absolutely.
I’ll do some island-hopping once I’m out of office.
And you guys can show me all the good places to go.
On this issue of off-shore financial centers, we respect each country to set up its own financial regulations.
And we recognize that for small countries, that providing services -- including financial services -- may be an important source of revenue.The one thing that we have to make sure of is that these financial centers are not either used for illicit money laundering or tax avoidance by large U.S. corporations that set up cut-outs or front organizations, but as a practical matter are operating in the United States, employing folks in the United States, essentially headquartered in the United States and yet, somehow, their mailing address is such-and-such island where they have to pay no taxes.Those are the kinds of egregious concerns that we’re trying to deal with.
I think we try to take it on a case-by-case basis.
And in my CARICOM meeting that I just had, this issue was brought up.
There were a number of leaders who expressed concern that maybe they were being unfairly labeled as areas of high financial risk.
And what I committed to them is we will examine their complaints and go through in very concrete ways where our concerns are and how our governments can work together.More broadly, I think that the -- if you look at some of the most successful countries in the world, they’re actually pretty small countries -- like Singapore, for example -- that on paper look like they have no assets, and yet, if you go to Singapore, it has one of the highest standards of living in the world.
What is it that Singapore did that might be replicable?Well, one of the most important things they did was they made an enormous investment in their people.
And if you’ve got a highly skilled, highly educated workforce, if you’ve set up rules of law and governance that are transparent and non-corrupt, then you can attract actually a lot of service industries to supplement the tourist industry, because people would want to locate in your country.
You could envision people wanting to operate and have offices there where you’ve got a trained workforce.
And these days, so many businesses are operating over the Internet that if you’ve got a really skilled workforce that provides value added, you will attract companies and you’ll attract businesses.What deters people from investing in most countries is conflict, corruption, and a lack of skills or infrastructure.
And those countries that are able to address those problems have rule of law and eliminate corruption.
Make sure that you are investing in the education of your people and it’s a continuous education; it doesn’t just stop at the lower grades, but you give people constant opportunities to upgrade their skills.
You have a decent infrastructure -- you’re going to be able to succeed.
That’s the recipe, the formula for a 21st-century economy.All right.
Uh oh, they’re starting to holler at me.
Let’s see, I haven’t gone back here in a while.
This gentleman in the blue shirt right here.Q    Thanks so much, Mr. President.
We know that there’s been an increasing military assertiveness of China, especially in the South China Sea.
And it seems that the U.S. has responded to that by pledging to increase its military presence because it recognizes the danger that that military increase of China poses to its friends and allies there.
Now, China’s growing power isn’t just military, it’s economic.
On this side of the world, China has used this soft power, this economic power especially to woo Caribbean governments.My questions are, how does the U.S. view China’s influence in its own backyard, especially since you’ve just talked about the Cold War and alliances?
And secondly, what plan does the U.S. have, if any, to contribute more to economic life in the Caribbean to ward off China in terms of foreign direct investment?
Thank you very much, Mr. President.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  What’s your name?Q    Oh, sorry.
My name is Newton Harris from the University of Technology-Jamaica.
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Fantastic.
Well, first of all, let me say that it is U.S. official policy and it is my strong belief that we should welcome China’s peaceful rise.
What China has done in the last 20, 30 years is remarkable.
More people have been lifted out of poverty in a shorter period of time than perhaps any time in human history.
And that’s good for the world.
I mean, we should be more fearful of a poorer, collapsing China than a China that is participating in the world marketplace and trading and is getting along with its neighbors and part of the international order, because there are a really large number of Chinese people and we want them to be doing well.So our policy is not to fear China’s peaceful rise.
Where we get concerned with China is where it is not necessarily abiding by international norms and rules, and is using its size and muscle to force countries into subordinate positions.
And that's the concern we have around maritime issues.
We think this can be solved diplomatically, but just because the Philippines or Vietnam are not as large as China doesn’t mean that they can just be elbowed aside.And, by the way, we don't have a particular view on the territorial disputes, the maritime disputes.
Our attitude is simply, let’s use the mechanisms that we have in place internationally to resolve them.Now, with respect to Chinese investment in the Caribbean or in the Americas, in the Western Hemisphere, my response is the same one that I gave when I was asked this question in Africa, which is, if China is making investments that are building up infrastructure, or improving education, or helping the people, then we welcome that.
We think that's great.
The only thing is you got to make sure you look at what strings may be attached.
If the investments are made and it's solely to build a road to a mine to extract raw materials that are going to then be immediately going to a port and shipped to China, and if Chinese workers are shipped in to build the road -- (applause) -- and if you don't know exactly what the deal was with the government that led to China getting the contract -- (applause) -- in those situations, it may not be, in fact, serving the long-term interests of the country.Now, I would say -- by the way, I'd say the same thing about the United States.
So if we come in with an aid package to your country, and we say we got this great deal, we're going to give you $100 million for such and such, but if when you evaluate the actual benefits, it's U.S. companies that are disproportionately benefitting from it, and it's creating a situation where over the long term the United States is making a whole lot of profits but is not leaving behind a sustainable industrial base or ways in which that country can develop, then you have to evaluate that and try to get a better deal.So what I'm saying is not unique to China.
I think that's how all countries should be operating.
Your government should be transparent; it should be clear about what you're getting.
There should be an accounting of how the money flows.
There should be a sense that over the long term, Jamaican businesses or somebody from Belize is getting a job, or -- right?
I mean, there should be some sense of how is this benefitting us over the long term.
And that's I think the only criteria that we're going to lay out.Now, last thing I'll say -- because you asked -- you kind of posed, is there like a bidding war going on here for affections.
The Chinese are giving us flowers and chocolates -- (laughter) -- what are you doing for us lately?
And so what I would say is this.
The United States, I think historically, has been an enormous provider of development aid.
Not always, by the way, has it followed the rule I just laid out in terms of whether or not the local recipients are benefitting, but I think we've gotten a lot better at that.And if you look at institutions like the World Bank or other multilateral institutions, we remain the largest contributors by far.
So sometimes when you get money from a multilateral institution -- you look at who’s doing what; if you look at what happens in terms of when Haiti gets decimated, who’s raising the money -- we tend to look pretty good.
It turns out we're doing more than our fair share.
And we will continue to do that.We do have some fiscal constraints.
And sometimes, I think -- when I travel to the Americas, to the region, people ask, why don't we have sort of the kinds of Alliance for Progress programs with huge sums of money.
Well, part of it is, is that right after World War II, the United States was so large relative to the rest of the world.
Japan was decimated; Europe was decimated.
Huge chunks of the world were behind the Iron Curtain.
And so it was natural that we gave fivefold or tenfold more than anybody else could do.
Well, things have evened out, in case you haven't noticed.We're still, by far, the most powerful nation on Earth and we still do more than everybody else, but we do expect others to step up and do their fair share.
But I can guarantee you this:  We will always do our fair share.
And nowhere is that truer than in the Caribbean and in the Americas, because you are our neighbors and some of our closest friends.
Let’s see.
It's a young lady’s turn.
This young lady right here.
Right here.Q    Welcome, Mr. President.
I lived a block away from you in Chicago when I went to the University of Chicago.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Is that right?Q    And my college sweetheart, Sam Kass, was your private chef until very recently.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Oh, wow!
Well, you're just putting Sam’s business all out there.
What’s your name?Q    Lisandra Rickards.
I work for the Branson Centre of Entrepreneurship.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Cassandra?Q    Lisandra.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Lisandra.
Well, I'll tease Sam about this one.
Q    Please do.
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Everybody knows about you now.
Go ahead.Q    My question is around immigration.
We've heard a lot about your immigration policy for undocumented immigrants who are currently living in the U.S.
But what about hopeful families that are seeking a legal pathway for immigration into the U.S. but are finding seven- to ten-year delays before they even can get to apply?
I'd love to hear you talk some more about your policy regarding shortening that timeline and making it less onerous on the applicants.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Good.
That's a great question.
The United States is a nation of immigrants.
And this region has contributed to the remarkable progress that the United States has made over the last two centuries.
And my goal during the course of my presidency has been to make sure we continue to be a nation of immigrants as well as a nation of laws, and that we're attracting talent from all around the world.Part of what makes us special is you walk in Brooklyn and there are folks from everywhere.
But they’re all striving, they’re all talented, they’re all trying to make their dreams come true.
And that is what gives us the energy and the strength to be able to accomplish everything we've accomplished.So we need to fix what is, right now, a broken immigration system.
Part of it is dealing with those who are undocumented but who have been living there a long time, are part of the community, providing them with a pathway in which they have to earn a legal status, but recognizing that they’re there and we're not going to be separating out families.
That's not who we are.
That's not true to our values.
And ultimately, it's not good for our economy.But you are absolutely right that part of the reason that some people take the illegal route is because we make the legal route so difficult.
And so we're trying to identify ways to streamline that process.Now, I have to be honest.
A lot of people want to come to America.
So unless we just had no borders, there’s always going to be a wait.
There’s always going to be background checks.
There’s always going to be some prioritization in terms of who’s admitted and who’s not.
But I do think that there are practices we have -- for example, where someone has a relation in the United States, is clearly qualified to become at some point a legal resident and maybe in the future a citizen, but in order to do it they have to first leave the country, wait, and now they’re separated from their families.
I mean, there have to be ways in which we can make the system clearer and less burdensome.Some of those changes we wanted to make were in the legislation that was proposed and passed the United States Senate.
I think there is still the opportunity to get that done before my presidency is over, but it does require the Republican Party I think to engage with me in a more serious effort, and to put aside the politics.Thank you very much for the question.
All right, this side has been neglected right here.
I'm going to go with this guy with the beard, man, because he looks a little bit like -- (applause) -- he looks a little bit like Marshawn Lynch.
Q    Greetings, Mr. President.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  How are you?Q    More life and blessings on you and your family.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  What’s your name?Q    My name is Miguel Williams, but you can call -- I am Steppa.
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Steppa.Q    Yeah, man, that is quite sufficient.
My question has to do and surrounds U.S. policy as it regards the legalization, the decriminalization of marijuana.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  How did I anticipate this question?
Q    Yeah, man.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  How did I guess this question?Q    Yes.
And, Mr. President, it really comes under (inaudible).
We face economic challenges with the IMF, et cetera.
And and we find realistically that the hemp industry, the marijuana industry provides a highly feasible alternative to rise above poverty.
So I am wanting to over stand and to understand how U.S. is envisioning and how you would you see Jamaica pushing forward on a decriminalization, legalization emphasis on the hemp industry.
PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Okay.
Well.
Let me -- I do want to separate out what are serious issues in the United States and then how that relates to our foreign policy and our interactions with the region.
There is the issue of legalization of marijuana, and then there is the issue of decriminalizing or dealing with the incarceration and, in some cases, devastation of communities as a consequence of nonviolent drug offenses.I am a very strong believer that the path that we have taken in the United States in the so-called “War on Drugs” has been so heavy in emphasizing incarceration that it has been counterproductive.
You have young people who did not engage in violence who get very long penalties, get placed in prison, and then are rendered economically unemployable, are almost pushed into, then, the underground economy, learn crime more effectively in prison, families are devastated.So it’s been very unproductive.
And what we’re trying to do is to reform our criminal justice system.
And the good news is there has actually been some interest on the part of unlikely allies like the evangelical community or some otherwise very conservative Republicans, because it’s very expensive to incarcerate people, and a recognition that this may not be the best approach.
So that’s one issue.There’s then the second issue of legalizing marijuana, whether it’s medical marijuana or recreational use.
There are two states in the United States that have embarked on an experiment to decriminalize or legalize marijuana -- Colorado and Washington State.
And we will see how that experiment works its way through the process.Right now, that is not federal policy, and I do not foresee anytime soon Congress changing the law at a national basis.
But I do think that if there are states that show that they are not suddenly a magnet for additional crime, that they have a strong enough public health infrastructure to push against the potential of increased addiction, then it’s conceivable that that will spur on a national debate.
But that is going to be some time off.And then the third issue is what will U.S. international policy be.
And we had some discussion with the CARICOM countries about this.
I know on paper a lot of folks think, you know what, if we just legalize marijuana, then it’ll reduce the money flowing into the transnational drug trade, there are more revenues and jobs created.I have to tell you that it’s not a silver bullet, because, first of all, if you are legalizing marijuana, then how do you deal with other drugs, and where do you draw the line?
Second of all, as is true in the global economy generally, if you have a bunch of small medium-sized marijuana businesses scattered across the Caribbean and this is suddenly legal, if you think that big multi-national companies are not going to suddenly come in and market and try to control and profit from the trade -- that’s I think a very real scenario.And so I think we have to have a conversation about this, but our current policy continues to be that in the United States, we need to decrease demand.
We need to focus on a public health approach to decreasing demand.
We have to stop the flow of guns and cash into the Caribbean and Central America and Latin America.
And at the same time, I think the Caribbean, Latin America have to -- Central America -- have to cooperate with us to try to shrink the power of the transnational drug organizations that are vicious and hugely destructive.And if we combine a public health perspective, a focus on not simply throwing every low-level person with possession into prison by trying to get them treatment, if we combine that with economic development and alternative opportunities for youth, then I think we can strike the right balance.
It may not comport with your -- completely with your vision for the future, but I think that we could certainly have a smarter approach to it than we currently do.Got time for one more question.
One more question.
Let’s see -- this is always hard.
It’s always hard to be that last -- it’s a lady’s turn, so all the guys just have to put down their hands.
It’s too late for you.
Let’s see.
You know what, I’m just going to go with this young lady right here.
She’s just right in front.
Go ahead, yes, you.
Hold on a second, wait for the mic.
Q    Afternoon, Mr. President.
I’m Alana Williams (ph), I’m from the South Side of Chicago.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Wait, you’re from Chicago?Q    Yes!PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, what are you doing here?
This is supposed to be for Caribbean young ladies.Q    Actually, I attend Olivet Nazarene University and I’m studying abroad, so I’m here.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  I see, okay.
Well, you’re cheating a little bit.
I’ll have to call on somebody else after you.
But I’m going to go ahead and let you ask a question real quick.
Because I’ll see you in Chicago.
Q    Most definitely.
My question is really more so about home.
I love my city, but the violence is terrible, specifically amongst young black men.
And I know we’re talking a lot about police brutality, but I’ve lost a lot of friends from people who look just like me.
And that’s the problem.
And so I would like to know what you believe is the true source of the violence, and what is one solution to an extreme problem.
Thank you.PRESIDENT OBAMA:  Well, look, I know you asked it about Chicago but I know there are neighborhoods right here in Jamaica that have the same problems, and in every place all across the Caribbean; certainly in Central America.I don’t think there is just one single factor.
Obviously, a contributor is one that we just talked about, which is the drug trade.
If you have an illicit trade that generates huge amounts of money and is not regulated above board, that is going to attract ultimately people trying to carve out turf, trying to control markets, and violence ensues.
So that’s point number one.Point number two is the easy accessibility of weapons.
And we were talking earlier about different traditions; the United States has a tradition of gun ownership that is deep; dates back to the pioneer past.
And I think it is a mistake that we do not do a better job of putting in place common-sense gun-safety regulations that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals, but unfortunately a majority of Congress does not agree with me.
Even after six-year-olds were gunned down viciously in their classroom, we could not get action done.
But what we are doing is cooperating with the region as we are cooperating with local jurisdictions to try to stem at least the flow of guns using the administrative tools that I have.
So that’s number two.Number three is providing alternative paths for young people.
If a young person is reading by the age -- by the third grade and at grade level, if they are enjoying school, if they see a path for success, then they are less likely to get involved in criminal activity and that will reduce gun violence, and that will reduce crime, and that will reduce death.
Which means investing in things like early childhood education and improving our schools -- those things are absolutely vital.
But there is a fourth element to this, and that is our own responsibility.
And particularly, as I speak to young people here today, we always talk about what can we do about the violence as if it’s like just separate and apart.
But we have control in our communities of our immediate friends, our immediate family.
We influence our peers.
And I do think that the power that all of you have as young leaders to be able to not make excuses for violence -- because there are a whole bunch of folks who have really tough backgrounds and come from terrible circumstances, and are really poor, but they don’t go around shooting somebody.
They don’t beat somebody over the head because of sneakers or because they looked at them the wrong way.And so there is an element of us retaking our communities and being willing to speak out against violence in our midst.
That doesn’t ignore all the social factors.
But Dr. King used to say it’s not an either/or situation, it’s a both/and situation.Government has to act.
We have to have effective policing, which means policing that is actually protecting as opposed to some of the things that we’ve been seeing of late in the United States, and I’m sure is true in other countries.
And I say that saying that police have an extraordinarily difficult job, and the overwhelming majority do a great job under severe circumstances.
But there’s got to be trust built between the communities, and I had to put a task force together that put together some excellent reports in the wake of Ferguson around how we can do that.But ultimately, what happens in the home, what happens in the school -- some of you are parents already; some of you will be parents -- what we teach our children in terms of values, valuing themselves, valuing others, that’s important, too.
So there’s no single solution.
But all of us have to do better.
Obama’s father, Barack Sr., a Kenyan economist, met his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, when both were students in Hawaii, where Barack was born on August 4, 1961.
They later divorced, and Barack’s mother married a man from Indonesia, where he spent his early childhood.
Before fifth grade, he returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents and attend Punahou School on scholarship.In his memoirDreams from My Father(1995), Obama describes the complexities of discovering his identity in adolescence.
After two years at Occidental College in Los Angeles, he transferred to Columbia University, where he studied political science and international relations.
Following graduation in 1983, Obama worked in New York City, then became a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago, coordinating with churches to improve housing conditions and set up job-training programs in a community hit hard by steel mill closures.
In 1988, he went to Harvard Law School, where he attracted national attention as the first African American president of theHarvard Law Review.
Returning to Chicago, he joined a small law firm specializing in civil rights.In 1992, Obama married Michelle Robinson, a lawyer who had also excelled at Harvard Law.
Their daughters, Malia and Sasha, were born in 1998 and 2001, respectively.
Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, and then to the U.S. Senate in 2004.
At the Democratic National Convention that summer, he delivered a much acclaimed keynote address.
Some pundits instantly pronounced him a future president, but most did not expect it to happen for some time.
Nevertheless, in 2008 he was elected over Arizona Senator John McCain by 365 to 173 electoral votes.As an incoming president, Obama faced many challenges—an economic collapse, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the continuing menace of terrorism.
Inaugurated before an estimated crowd of 1.8 million people, Obama proposed unprecedented federal spending to revive the economy and also hoped to renew America’s stature in the world.
During his first term he signed three signature bills: an omnibus bill to stimulate the economy, legislation making health care more accessible and affordable, and legislation reforming the nation’s financial institutions.
Obama also pressed for a fair pay act for women, financial reform legislation, and efforts for consumer protection.
In 2009, Obama became the fourth president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.In 2012, he was reelected over former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney by 332 to 206 electoral votes.
The Middle East remained a key foreign policy challenge.
Obama had overseen the killing of Osama bin Laden, but a new self-proclaimed Islamic State arose during a civil war in Syria and began inciting terrorist attacks.
Obama sought to manage a hostile Iran with a treaty that hindered its development of nuclear weapons.
The Obama administration also adopted a climate change agreement signed by 195 nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming.In the last year of his second term, Obama spoke at two events that clearly moved him—the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery, and the dedication of the National Museum of African American History and Culture.
Our union is not yet perfect, but we are getting closer,” he said in Selma.
And that’s why we celebrate,” he told those attending the museum opening in Washington, “mindful that our work is not yet done.”Learn more about Barack Obama’s spouse,Michelle Obama.President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama pose with their daughters, Malia and SashaStay ConnectedSign UpEmail Address*RequiredZIP CodePlease leave blank.We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.ShareShare this page on FacebookShare this page on Twitterhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/barack-obama/?utm_source=linkHomeThe AdministrationExecutive OfficesPrioritiesThe RecordBriefing RoomThe White HouseDisclosuresGet InvolvedEspañolContact UsPrivacy PolicyCopyright PolicyAccessibility StatementInstagramOpens in a new windowFacebookOpens in a new windowTwitterOpens in a new windowYouTubeOpens in a new windowThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave NWWashington, DC 20500WH.govScroll to TopScroll to TopTop

He talked about the lasting influence of Ms.
Hefty, his fifth-grade teacher, and asked readers to share their own education stories.This morning, the President sent the following message to the White House email list, highlighting the importance of having good teachers on the road to higher education and a brighter future.
Hefty, his fifth-grade teacher, and asked readers to share their own education stories.Add your voice to the conversation here, and tell us what made your education possible -- whether it was a teacher who inspired you, a book that changed you, or a college that shaped you.
And if you didn't get the President's email,sign up for email updates here.
I credit my education to Ms. Mabel Hefty just as much as I would any institution of higher learning.When I entered Ms.
All we need now is the Queen to jump on board and he'll sail onto the set.The 40-year-old star plays cop John Luther in TV drama 'Luther' and has found an unlikely fan in the US leader, who admitted he is addicted to the show because he can relate to the character.Idris said: 'The Obamas invited me to the White House and I had fun, a good time.
David Cameron and his wife [Samantha] were there - he is a 'Luther' fan and so is Barack Obama.
When I saw the president I said, 'Mr.
President, I hear I am not your favourite character in 'The Wire' ', and he said, 'Well, yeah, but Luther - that's me.'
What makes Elba even more affable is the fact that he doesn't even consider himself a star.
Despite starring as the lead role in Pacific Rim, he's been quoted commenting on the fact that there's no big names in the movie:'You pay £15 to see this movie and essentially there is not a star in it.
I'm not [a star].
This is a worldwide market - when this opens in Japan they are not going to say, 'Oh, Idris Elba!

He is already called one of the greatest presidents in history.
Charismatic, charming and the first Black president of the United States.
As we mourn Obama leaving office in just a few weeks, here are our picks for who should play the key roles in Barack Obama: The Movie.
Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images)2 / 12Will Smith or Chiwetel Ejiofor as President Barack Obama  - Playing Barack Obama is a coveted part for Black actors everywhere (and Fred Armisen), but we'd put odds on either Will Smith or Talk to Me actor Chiwetel Ejiofor.
Smith could nail Obama's charm and good humor, while Ejiofor has the gravitas to play the leader of the free world.
But considering Smith has the president on speed dial, we'd give him the advantage on this one.
Photos from left: Larry Busacca/Getty Images, Stuart Wilson/Getty Images)3 / 12Regina King as Michelle Obama  - There's more to Michelle Obama than just toned arms and a killer smile.
Regina Hall is our pick to play one of history's most popular first ladies, known for her grace, wit and no-nonsense attitude.
King's roles as lawyers on Ally McBeal and Law & Order should help in her portrayal of whip-smart Michelle.
Photos from left: Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images, Kevin Winter/NBCUniversal/Getty Images)4 / 12Keke Palmer as Malia Obama  - The Obamas have done a great job of keeping Sasha and Malia out of the spotlight, so much so that audiences took a collective gasp after seeing Malia, all grown up and looking gorgeous, at the Democratic convention.
We suggest one of our favorite wholesome young actresses, True Jackson, VP star Keke Palmer, to play teenager Malia.
Photos from left: John Ricard / BET, Alex Wong/Getty Images)5 / 12Zoe Soul as Sasha Obama  - Sweet, luminous and funny, Sasha Obama is the kind of little sister nobody would mind having around.
We recommend Reed Between the Lines star Zoe Soul to portray the 11-year-old.
It's all in the smile...and the hair!
Photos from left: John Ricard / BET, Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)ADVERTISEMENT6 / 12Derek Luke as Barack Obama Sr.   - To play the man who looms large in the president's imagination and is the subject of his best-selling book requires an actor of considerable chops.
We nominate Derek Luke for the part of the Kenya-born missionary and intellectual, whose history with Islam gave President Obama his middle name and a right-wing headache.
Photos from lwft: Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images, Public Domain)7 / 12Kate Winslet as Ann Dunham  - President Obama has called his late mother the "dominant figure of my formative years," whose values provided the foundation of his political beliefs.
Dunham, who worked on a Ph.D. at the University of Hawaii, could only be portrayed by an actress with the smarts and gravitas of Oscar-winner Winslet.
Photos from left: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images, REUTERS/Obama For America /Landov)8 / 12Meryl Streep as Hillary Clinton  - Hillary Clinton went from Obama's worst foe to one of his closest confidantes and a star member of his cabinet.
The feisty secretary of state would best be portrayed by Meryl Streep, no stranger to transforming into historical figures on the big screen.
Photos from left: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for AFI, Peter Macdiarmid - WPA Pool/Getty Images)9 / 12Jeff Bridges as Bill Clinton  - For the role of President Obama's irrepressibly charming, bad-boy-with-a-grin ally, we nominate Jeff Bridges.
The actor has plenty of good ol' boy charm and enough gray hair to accurately portray the former Democratic president.
Photos from left: John Shearer/Getty Images, Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)10 / 12Liam Neeson as Joe Biden  - Vice presidents don't usually enter the pop culture zeitgeist, but Joe Biden is not your average VP.
The gaffe-prone politician is a celebrity in his own right, so who better to play him than Liam Neeson, who has surprised more than one talk show host with his bawdy sense of humor.
Photos from left: Jemal Countess/Getty Images, Alex Wong/Getty Images)ADVERTISEMENT11 / 12Josh Brolin as Mitt Romney  - Mitt Romney is defined by his wealth, influential family and rugged good looks.
To play Obama's worthy opponent in the 2012 presidential election, who could be better than Josh Brolin, who himself has come from privilege?
The actor had a famous father and has already portrayed a Republican president on the big screen.
Photos from left: Stuart Wilson/Getty Images, Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)12 / 12Spike Lee, Director  - You know politically-opinionated Spike Lee is dying to get his hands on this project.
And who better to craft the story of this century's most significant political and historic figure than the man who has dedicated his career to making statements about Black culture, influence and progress on film?
We can count on Lee to give the story a balanced approach.

Matt Dinerstein/APhide captiontoggle captionMatt Dinerstein/APThis image released by Roadside Attractions shows Tika Sumpter (L) and Parker Sawyers in a scene from "Southside With You.
Matt Dinerstein/APA new romantic comedy hit more than 800 theaters on Friday, the kind of film that Hollywood scarcely makes nowadays.
It's about two interesting people at the start of their adult lives circling each other trying to figure things out.
Oh, and chances are you might know the people at the center of the story — Barack and Michelle Obama.The film is calledSouthsideWith Youand it stars Parker Sawyers as Barack Obama and Tika Sumpter as Michelle Robinson.
It's loosely based on the couple's first date in Chicago in the summer of 1989 when they were just young associates at the same law firm.Directed by Richard Tanne and executive produced by Grammy Award-winning singer John Legend,Southside With Youis already getting rave reviews for its smart and nuanced take on life, on love and its dead-on performances.NPR's Michel Martin spoke recently with the film's stars Sawyers and Sumpter.
The latter also helped produce the movie.RoadsideFlixYouTubeInterview highlights contain some extended Web-only content.Interview highlightsOn what about the film's director and screenplay writer Richard Tanne's idea hooked TikaTika:It was the perspective that really intrigued me.
I like that Michelle Robinson and Barack Obama were 25 and 28 at the time.
And I just thought, "Wow, this would be really interesting to see the origin of."
... Once he wrote the script, I just thought this was so smart, it was funny, it was everything that a romantic could be and more.On what made this film a passion project for TikaTika:One, it was a really big lead role for me, I've never played the lead.
I've had the girlfriend role, I've had the wife role.
I've had those kind of sidekick roles, but it was just so nice, especially being a black woman in Hollywood, having a romantic lead that was very charming, very sweet, very smart.
It was about these two amazing characters, even if you took the Obamas out of it.
It was just about these intelligent people unfolding before each other.On what was it that attracted Parker to the roleParker:I jumped at the chance to play such a three-dimensional character with an entire history behind him and a future ahead of him.
Also, I needed a break and I was looking forward to a lead role or a strong supporting role in a major film to give me that break.
And this came along and I was over the moon to win the role.On if he'd heard in the past that he resembles President Obama and about his process in portraying the younger BarackParker:Yes, I'd heard that, probably for five years and then more when I got into acting.
If I put on a suit and I'm clean-shaven, we do resemble each other.
... As the older Barack Obama, everything is considered, he joins words with the croak in his throat.
... As the younger Barack Obama, I would just loosen it up a bit.
... On set, I started off with a strong impersonation and every morning I would recite some of the words that President Obama said in his voice and then when I got to set I would drop it all and try to play the truth of the scene.On how Tika was able to channel Michelle RobinsonTika:I read a lot of books.
I read her thesis, which I'm still trying to understand — the intelligence is at an all-time high.
I read her brother's bookGame of Character, which really helped me to see how she grew up and who she was during that time.
... She has such a distinctive voice that I got a dialect coach, we wanted to make sure that I was on top of that as well.
That and just looking at some videos of some of her mannerisms to put in the character as the young Michelle.
But I got to create who I thought she was during that time from personal accounts of other people because there aren't any videos of her at 25.
...
Her voice for me was the most challenging part because she's very hard on her words, she means every single thing.On if it was scary taking on the role of Michelle RobinsonTika:At first, I guess it is, if you put on the heaviness of the Obamas and who they are now, but not for Michelle Robinson back then, for me.
Because she's a girl from the south side of Chicago trying to make it like everybody else, super smart, but still dealing with issues that we still deal with today.
I think that's what makes her accessible to millions of women around the world, her very humble beginnings.On why Parker thinks President Obama is such a polarizing figureParker:There's the black factor, I think that has something to do with it.
And also, he motivates and inspires a group of people, even abroad.
... And he's very successful in motivating people to get out — to get out to the polls, and the petitions.
And he's opened up the White House and a lot of people don't like that.On what they hope the film will doParker:I hope it's refreshing for audiences and at the end of the summer and we've been inundated with CGI film and all of the action movies so I think this is a nice respite from that.
The themes are family, forgiveness, working for something you believe in, ambition.
And it highlights the humble beginnings of the Obamas and so I think people can take from it a reflection of their lives as well.Tika:I totally agree with Parker.
I think if he is polarizing or the family is polarizing in any way, people who are Republicans have walked in and walked out different.
They didn't want to walk in there and when they walked out they said, "It's just a love story" with many different themes.
I hope it just makes people smile.
And I hope they feel refreshed and I hope they feel some sort of connection.
I think whatever political stand you take, it's not a political film.
It's the origins of this amazing couple and I think anybody who has ever fallen in love can understand.On Tika and other African-American actors taking on the role of producing filmsTika:I think a lot of the times roles aren't created for them and with them in mind and people are tired of feeling dismissed or ignored.
I think people are just taking it into their own hands and saying, "This is what I want to do," and having the power to actually make it work and the passion to make it work and stories that really matter to them.
I think it's a trend that's not going to go away and I think that more and more actors are going to try to create their own lanes.tika sumpterparker SawyersSouthside WIth YouBarack ObamaFacebookFlipboardEmailRead & ListenHomeNewsCultureMusicPodcasts & ShowsConnectNewslettersFacebookInstagramPressContact & HelpAbout NPROverviewDiversityAccessibilityEthicsFinancesPublic EditorCorrectionsGet InvolvedSupport Public RadioSponsor NPRNPR CareersNPR ShopNPR EventsNPR ExtraTerms of UsePrivacyYour Privacy ChoicesText OnlySponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor

Many of those characters were based on real-life individuals.One actor from the show, Michael Kostroff, who portrayed sleazy gang lawyer Maury Levy, volunteered during Obama’s 2008 campaign.
Following meeting the future president in Las Vegas, Kostroff told theLas Vegas SunthatThe Wirewas Obama’s favorite show.
He further said that Obama also shared his favorite character.
It wasn’t Levy, the attorney, rather Omar Little, a Robin-Hood-like character who would steal from drug dealers and share with the poor.“That’s not an endorsement,” Obama said.
He’s not my favorite person, but he’s a fascinating character.” Omar wasportrayed by Michael K. Williams.
Some of Omar’s traits include a facial scar, an openly gay lifestyle, never using curse words, and often seen in a trench coat.His backstory reads that Omar was an orphan raised by his grandmother.
He took to the streets and was involved in a robbery at the age of nine, according toFandom.
Omar committed five murders during the life of the show.He was killed offbefore the show’s end in the final season.Some of Obama’s other favorite showsBruce@Springsteenand I close out our podcast, Renegades: Born in the USA, back where it all began: with a conversation about the story of America and how to restore faith in its promise.

Getty/HBO(CBS News) Fans of "The Wire" all have their favorite characters from HBO series - and so does President Obama.The president shared his pick this weekduring an interviewwith Grantland's Bill Simmons.Simmons asked, "Settle an office debate.
Best 'Wire' character of all time?
It's got to be Omar, right?"
the president responded.
I mean, that guy is unbelievable, right?
Omar Little, played on the Baltimore-set series by Michael K. Williams, is a shotgun-toting gay man who makes his living holding up drug dealers.
What a combination," Mr. Obama said of the character.
And that was one of the best shows of all time.

Ina meeting withThe Wirecreator David Simon, the President unveiled the answer to the question that has dogged him since his inauguration (and no earlier, because we didn’t care prior to that): Who is his favorite character onThe Wire?
Omar is, by the way, my favorite character on my favorite show,” Obama said, echoing the opinion of all right-thinking people everywhere.WatchCedric The Entertainer on directing the 100th episode of "The Neighborhood," Steve Harvey, and MoreCCShareSubtitlesOffEnglishShare this VideoFacebookTwitterEmailRedditLinkview videoCedric The Entertainer on directing the 100th episode ofThe Neighborhood, Steve Harvey, and MoreR.I.P.
Logan RoyYesterdayKyra Sedgwick onThe Closer,Brooklyn Nine-Nine, andSpace OddityYesterdayThe sit-down between the two men was actually part of an effort on behalf of the White House to promote the reform of mandatory minimum sentencing laws, something Simon hasadvocated for years.
The President pointed to growing consensus that such laws are ineffective, a statement to which Simon, who produced a TV series that spent five seasons making that exact point, deserves some kind of award for not rolling his eyes and saying, “A-no-a-duh.”AdvertisementObama said that he’s a “huge fan” of the show, and the two men discussed the ways in which the series demonstrated the problems with racist sentencing laws and the destabilizing effect on the labor force of so many unnecessary felony convictions.
The character of Omar in particular came up as an example, as Simon said the real-life inspiration for the character, Donnie Andrews, is a testament to everything wrong with these laws:He wasn’t caught.
He actually went in on conscience because it finally got to him.
He came out 17 years later, and all he wanted to do was give back to West Baltimore.
He had taken so much, and he just wanted to address himself from the disaster.
And on paper—that man was an extraordinary man, one of the most extraordinary men I have met in my life—but on paper, he was a convicted felon and a convicted murderer.Nearly 80% offRobot Vacuum and Mop Combo - Down from $700 to $146 Today3-in-1 mopping robot vacuumThis self-cleaning robot vacuum and mop can handle hardwood and carpets alike and even pair with Google Assistant or Alexa.Buy for$146at AmazonAdvertisementAdvertisementHopefully this will be the beginning of a sequence of interviews Obama conducts with show creators in relation to how their TV series can speak to the need for policy change.

Obama makes an appearance inTelegraph Avenue, the latest novel by Michael Chabon, who won the Pulitzer Prize forThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.The book takes place in Oakland, Calif., in the now-distant summer of 2004.
Obama, still an Illinois state senator, but a national figure thanks to his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention, has been dispatched to California to speak at $1,000-a-head fundraiser for John Kerry.
There, he bonds with Gwen Starks, one of the few black women in the crowd, over a pick-up band’s cover of Stevie Wonder’s “Higher Ground.”The fictional Obama infers (or says he infers) that the woman’s husband is playing bass, and that someone close to him has died recently.“I gathered that, something about a man named Jones.”“Yeah, yes, he was supposed to be here, he played the organ.
It’s Cochise Jones.”“Cochise Jones, okay.”Perhaps the name registered, a shallow footprint tracked in the sand of the senator’s memory.
But the print might as easily have been left byElginor Philly Joe.LocalIndiana28 mins agoIndustrial Fire Prompts Evacuation Order in Indiana CityMichigan46 mins agoMichigan Man Pleads No Contest to Shooting 84-Year-Old Anti-Abortion Campaigner“He was supposed to be here, to play.
It just happened, he passed this afternoon.”“I am so sorry to hear that.”"He was like a father to my husband.”Somehow, easily, the band morphed into a cover of Bad Medicine’s “Trespasser.”“Thank you for telling me that,” Obama said.
You know, I could hear it in his playing.
Something grieving.
But I didn’t know what it was.”All politicians have tricks for bonding with voters, but this passage gives the inner-directed Obama more credit for emotional intelligence than he deserves – but not more than a Berkeley litterateur like Chabon would like to imagine he possesses.
It’s also hard to imagine an ambitious politician pausing for three pages of soulful talk when there’s money to be raised.
All fictional characters are reflections of their authors.
And Obama, more than most politicians, is a reflection of his followers’ hopes.
The fictional Obama will always be better, kinder, smarter and more empathetic than the real thing.Obama is a big Stevie Wonder fan, though.
In fact, he and Michelle talked about their love of Stevie’s music on their first date.
So Chabon got that right.Trending StoriesYour $2 Bill Could Actually Be Worth a Whole Lot More.

Photo by Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images.TweetShareShareCommentTweetShareShareCommentIf not for Stevie, there might have been no Barack and Michelle.
I think it’s fair to say that had I not been a Stevie Wonder fan, Michelle might not have dated me,” Barack Obama said in 2009 while presenting Wonder with the Library of Congress’ Gershwin Prize.
We might not have married.
The fact that we agreed on Stevie was part of the essence of our courtship.” In the movieSouthside With You, a semifictional account of their first date, Barack and Michelle engage in a playful but unyielding debate about Wonder’s best album.
At least we can agree that Stevie is the best,” Michelle says.
At least we can start from there.” When they married in 1992, Wonder’s “You and I” wastheir wedding song.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementBarack Obama was born in 1961, the year an 11-year-old Stevie Wonder auditioned for Berry Gordy at Motown Records; 11 years later, he recalled during the Gershwin ceremony, Wonder’sTalking Bookwas the first LP Barack Obama bought with his own money, and he played it until he wore out the vinyl.
That 1972 album was alsothe first Michelle Obama ever owned, she toldHarper’s Bazaarin 2010, a gift from her grandfather, Purnell “Southside” Shields, a jazz aficionado who would blast music from speakers in every room of his house.
That’s where he and I would sit and listen to Stevie’s music together,” she said at the Gershwin ceremony.
Songs about life, love, romance, heartache, despair.
He would let me listen to these songs over and over and over and over again.”AdvertisementAdvertisementWonder’s songs, Michelle said during akeynote address at South by Southwest in March, “talked about unity and love and peace.
His songs are impacting and push you to think about how you could affect the world.
Stevie all the way.” But Barack’s relationship with Wonder, or at least willingness to share the love of his music, was more fraught.
Wonder, he toldRolling Stonea few months before he was elected president, was his “musical hero.” “When I was at that point where you start getting involved in music, Stevie had that run with Music of My Mind, Talking Book, Fulfillingness’ First Finale, and Innervisions, and then Songs in the Key of Life.
Those are as brilliant a set of five albums as we’ve ever seen.”AdvertisementAdvertisementWonder began as an innocuous child star, a virtuosic tween playing standards and what the title of his first album called “jazz soul”—music designed to be palatable to a white audience.
But by the time ofthat storied five-album run, Wonder’s work had become more political, less eager to please: “My Cherie Amour” and “I Was Made to Love Her” gave way to “Living for the City” and “Village Ghetto Land.” There were still joyous, uplifting songs like “You Are the Sunshine of My Life” and “Don’t You Worry ’bout a Thing,” and perhaps it was Wonder’s ability to explore the world’s injustices without letting them overwhelm him that appealed to the young Barack as he wrestled with his own identity.
I was trying to raise myself to be a black man in America,” he wrote in his memoir,Dreams From My Father:AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementNo one around me seemed to know exactly what that meant.
Where did I fit in?
The feeling that something wasn’t quite right stayed with me, a warning that sounded whenever a white girl mentioned in the middle of a conversationhow much she liked Stevie Wonder, or when a woman in the supermarket asked me if I played basketball; or when the school principal told me I was cool.
 There was a trick there somewhere, although what the trick was, who was doing the tricking, and who was being tricked eluded my conscious grasp.As the Obamas entered public life, Wonder came along with them.
He appeared at rallies during the 2008 campaign, evensetting Barack’s name to music, and went one better in 2012, writing a brand-new song called “Keep Moving Forward” for Obama’s re-election run.
Sample lyric: “Here we are, it’s a brand new day/ Four years ago the skies were a darker gray.”) He was at the Democratic National Convention in 2008, playing a still-unrecorded song called “Fear Can’t Put Dreams to Sleep” the night Barack Obama became the first person of color to be a major U.S. party’s presidential nominee, and he played at the inaugural ball after he became the nation’s first black president.
On the night Obama was elected, Wonder stood up in the middle of the famed Beverly Hills restaurant Mr. Chow—in the presence of Taylor Swift, no less—and delivered animpromptu speech.AdvertisementAdvertisementAll along, there was “Signed, Sealed, Delivered I’m Yours.” From Obama’s early rallies to hisspeechat the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Michelle’sCarpool Karaoketo what could be thelast major speechof her tenure as first lady, Wonder’s irrepressible anthem has served as their collective theme song and a rallying cry for their supporters.
We can’t wait till it’s signed, sealed and delivered,” 57-year-old Judy Shumaker told a reporter at an Obama rally in 2008.
We like Stevie Wonder because he’s an inspiration, just like this man.
Nothing kept them down.” Her husband, 61-year-old Bob Shumaker, agreed.
That music was one of the first things that brought the races together.
Parents just went nuts when we listened to [black] music in the 1950s,” he said.
In the ’60s, everything changed.”AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementOf course, as the simmering anger of Wonder’s 1970s albums attests, the 1960s did not “change everything,” and while Wonder hasn’t stopped playing his feel-good hits, they’re not all he plays: You can buy a ticket to see him playSongs in the Key of Lifelive, but you’ll get a ringing endorsement of Black Lives Matter with your oldies act.
Barack Obama has walked a similar line: You can have the endlessly ingratiating cool dad, but the man who gives searing speeches on systemic racism comes along with him.Stevie Wonder has performed for the Obamas, in public and in private, many times.
According toPolitico, he has performed for them more often than any other artist.
He was a guest at Barack’s 55thbirthday party and Michelle’s 50th; John Legend performedWonder’s version of “Happy Birthday”at the latter.
In 2014, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor.
It was the least they could give him in return.TweetShareShareCommentMusicWonder WeekAdvertisementAdvertisementAboutAbout UsWork With UsContactPitch GuidelinesSend Us TipsCorrectionsCommentingReprintsSubscriptionsSubscribeSign InAccountSubscription FAQsPodcast FAQsNewslettersCustomer SupportAdvertisingSite AdvertisingPodcast AdvertisingAdChoicesCookie PreferencesThe Slate Group logoSlate is published by The Slate

A virtualone-man band, Wonder's use ofsynthesizersand otherelectronic musical instrumentsduring the 1970s reshaped the conventions ofR&B.
He also helped drive such genres into thealbum era, crafting hisLPsas cohesive and consistent, in addition to socially conscious statements with complex compositions.Blindsince shortly after his birth, Wonder was achild prodigywho signed withMotown'sTamlalabel at the age of 11, where he was given the professional nameLittle Stevie Wonder.Wonder's single "Fingertips" was a No.
1 hit on theBillboardHot 100in 1963, at the age of 13, making him theyoungest artist everto top the chart.
Wonder's critical success was at its peak in the 1970s.
His "classic period" began in 1972 with the releases ofMusic of My MindandTalking Book, the latter featuring "Superstition", which is one of the most distinctive and famous examples of the sound of theHohner Clavinetkeyboard.
His worksInnervisions(1973),Fulfillingness' First Finale(1974) andSongs in the Key of Life(1976) all won theGrammy Award for Album of the Year, making him the tied-record holder for the mostAlbum of the Year wins, with three.
He is also the only artist to have won the award with three consecutive album releases.
Wonder began his "commercial period" in the 1980s; he achieved his biggest hits and highest level of fame, had increased album sales, charity participation, high-profile collaborations (includingPaul McCartneyandMichael Jackson), political impact, and television appearances.
Wonder has continued to remain active in music and political causes.Wonder is one of thebest-selling music artists of all time, with sales of over 100 million records worldwide.
He has won 25Grammy Awards(the most by a solo artist) and oneAcademy Award(Best Original Song, for the 1984 filmThe Woman in Red).
Wonder has been inducted into theRhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame,Rock and Roll Hall of FameandSongwriters Hall of Fame.
He is also noted for his work as an activist for political causes, including his 1980 campaign to makeMartin Luther King Jr.'s birthday afederal holidayin the U.S.
In 2009, he was named aUnited Nations Messenger of Peace, and in 2014, he was honored with thePresidential Medal of Freedom.Early lifeWonder was born Stevland Hardaway Judkins inSaginaw, Michigan, on May 13, 1950, the third of five children born toLula Mae Hardaway,[7]and the second of Hardaway's two children with Calvin Judkins.
8]He was born six weeks premature which, along with the oxygen-rich atmosphere in the hospital incubator, resulted inretinopathy of prematurity, a condition in which the growth of the eyes is aborted and causes theretinasto detach, so he became blind.
9][10]When Wonder was four, his mother divorced his father and moved with her three children toDetroit, Michigan, where Wonder sang as a child in a choir at the Whitestone Baptist Church.
11]She later rekindled her relationship with her first child's father (whose surname was also coincidentally Hardaway)[8]and changed her own name back to Lula Hardaway, going on to have two more children.When Stevie was signed by Motown in 1961, his surname was legally changed to Morris, which (according to Lula Mae Hardaway's authorized biography) was an old family name.
Berry Gordy was responsible for creating the stage name of "Little Stevie Wonder".
12]He began playing instruments at an early age, including piano, harmonica, and drums.
He formed a singing partnership with a friend; calling themselves Stevie and John, they played on street corners and occasionally at parties and dances.
13]As a child, Wonder attended Fitzgerald Elementary School in Detroit.
14]After his first album was released,The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie(1962), he enrolled inMichigan School for the BlindinLansing, Michigan.
15][16]Career1961–1969: Singles as a youthWonder rehearsing for a performance on Dutch television in 1967In 1961, at the age of 11, Wonder sang his own composition, "Lonely Boy", toRonnie Whiteofthe Miracles;[17][18]White then took Wonder and his mother to an audition atMotown, where CEOBerry Gordysigned Wonder to Motown's Tamla label.
7]Before signing, producerClarence Paulgave him the nameLittle Stevie Wonder.
9]Because of Wonder's age, the label drew up a rolling five-year contract in which royalties would be held in trust until Wonder was 21.
He and his mother would be paid a weekly stipend to cover their expenses: Wonder received $2.50 (equivalent to $22.67 in 2021) per week, and a private tutor was provided when Wonder was on tour.
18]Wonder was put in the care of producer and songwriter Clarence Paul, and for a year they worked together on two albums.Tribute to Uncle Raywas recorded first, when Wonder was still 11 years old.
Mainly covers ofRay Charles's songs, the album included a Wonder and Paul composition, "Sunset".The Jazz Soul of Little Steviewas recorded next, an instrumental album consisting mainly of Paul's compositions, two of which, "Wondering" and "Session Number 112", were co-written with Wonder.
19]Feeling Wonder was now ready, a song, "Mother Thank You", was recorded for release as a single, but then pulled and replaced by the Berry Gordy song "I Call It Pretty Music, But the Old People Call It the Blues" as his début single;[20]released summer 1962,[21]it almost broke into theBillboard100, spending one week of August at 101.
22]Two follow-up singles, "Little Water Boy" and "Contract on Love",  both had no success, and the two albums, released in reverse order of recording—The Jazz Soul of Little Steviein September 1962 andTribute to Uncle Rayin October 1962—also met with little success.
19][23]Most of these songs hit the charts in a big way before Stevie turned twenty-one [in 1971].
Because he's grown up fast, the love lyrics are less teen-specific than a lot of earlySmokey, say, but the music is purepuberty.
Stevie's rockers are always one step ahead of themselves—their gawky groove is so disorienting it makes you pay attention, like a voice that's perpetually changing.
The ballads conceivecoming of agemore conventionally, and less felicitously.

2inChristgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies(1981)[24]At the end of 1962, when Wonder was 12 years old, he joined theMotortown Revue, touring the "Chitlin' Circuit" of theatres across America that accepted black artists.
At theRegal Theater, Chicago, his 20-minute performance was recorded and released in May 1963 as the albumRecorded Live: The 12 Year Old Genius.
19]A single, "Fingertips", from the album was also released in May, and became a major hit.
25]The song, featuring a confident and enthusiastic Wonder returning for a spontaneous encore that catches out the replacement bass player, who is heard to call out "What key?
What key?
25][26]was a No.
1 hit on theBillboardHot 100when Wonder was aged 13, making him the youngest artist ever to top the chart.
27]The single was simultaneously No.
1 on the R&B chart, the first time that had occurred.
28]His next few recordings, however, were not successful; his voice was changing as he got older, and some Motown executives were considering cancelling his recording contract.
28]During 1964, Wonder appeared in two films as himself,Muscle Beach PartyandBikini Beach, but these were not successful either.
29]Sylvia Moypersuaded label owner Berry Gordy to give Wonder another chance.
28]Dropping the "Little" from his name, Moy and Wonder worked together to create the hit "Uptight (Everything's Alright)",[28]and Wonder went on to have a number of other hits during the mid-1960s, including "With a Child's Heart", and "Blowin' in the Wind",[26]aBob Dylansong, co-sung by his mentor, producer Clarence Paul.
30]He also began to work in the Motown songwriting department, composing songs both for himself and his label mates, including "The Tears of a Clown", a No.
1 hit forSmokey Robinson and the Miracles(it was first released in 1967, mostly unnoticed as the last track of theirMake It HappenLP, but eventually became a major success when re-released as a single in 1970, which prompted Robinson to reconsider his intention of leaving the group).
31]In 1968, he recorded an album of instrumental soul/jazz tracks, mostly harmonica solos, under the titleEivets Rednow, which is "Stevie Wonder" spelled backward.
32]The album failed to get much attention, and its only single, a cover of Burt Bacharach's and Hal David's "Alfie", only reached number 66 on the U.S.
Pop charts and number 11 on the US Adult Contemporary charts.
Nonetheless, he managed to score several hits between 1968 and 1970 such as "I Was Made to Love Her",[30]"For Once in My Life" and "Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours".
A number of Wonder's early hits, including "My Cherie Amour", "I Was Made to Love Her", and "Uptight (Everything's Alright)", were co-written withHenry Cosby.
The hit single "Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours" was his first-ever self-produced song.
33]In 1969, Wonder participated in theSanremo Music Festivalwith the song "Se tu ragazza mia", in conjunction withGabriella Ferri.
Between 1967 and 1970, he recorded four 45 rpm singles[34][35][36][37]and an Italian LP.

Wright and Wonder worked together on the next album,Where I'm Coming From(1971), Wonder writing the music, and Wright helping with the lyrics.
40]Around this time, Wonder became interested in utilizing synthesizers after hearing albums byelectronicgroupTonto's Expanding Head Band.
41]Wonder and Wright wanted to "touch on the social problems of the world", and for the lyrics "to mean something".
40]The album was released at around the same time asMarvin Gaye'sWhat's Going On.
As both albums had similar ambitions and themes, they have been compared; in a contemporaneous review byVince AlettiinRolling Stone, Gaye's was seen as successful, while Wonder's was seen as failing due to "self-indulgent and cluttered" production, "undistinguished" and "pretentious" lyrics, and an overall lack of unity and flow.
42]Also in 1970, Wonder co-wrote, and played numerous instruments on the hit "It's a Shame" for fellow Motown actthe Spinners.
His contribution was meant to be a showcase of his talent and thus a weapon in his ongoing negotiations with Gordy about creative autonomy.
43]Reaching his 21st birthday on May 13, 1971, Wonder allowed his Motown contract to expire.
44]During this period, he independently recorded two albums and signed a new contract withMotown Records.
The 120-page contract was a precedent at Motown and gave Wonder a much higherroyaltyrate.
45]He returned to Motown in March 1972 withMusic of My Mind.
Unlike most previous albums on Motown, which usually consisted of a collection of singles,B-sidesand covers,Music of My Mindwas a full-length artistic statement with songs flowing together thematically.
45]Wonder's lyrics dealt with social, political, and mystical themes as well as standard romantic ones, while musically he began exploring overdubbing and recording most of the instrumental parts himself.
45]Music of My Mindmarked the beginning of a long collaboration withTonto's Expanding Head Band(Robert MargouleffandMalcolm Cecil),[46][47]and with lyricistYvonne Wright.
48]Released in late 1972, Wonder's albumTalking Bookfeatured the No.
1 hit "Superstition",[49]which is one of the most distinctive and famous examples of the sound of the HohnerClavinetkeyboard.
50]Talking Bookalso featured "You Are the Sunshine of My Life", which also peaked at No.
1.
During the same time as the album's release, Wonder began touring with theRolling Stonesto alleviate the negative effects from pigeonholing as a result of being an R&B artist in America.
17]Wonder's touring with the Stones was also a factor behind the success of both "Superstition" and "You Are the Sunshine of My Life".
45][51]Between them, the two songs won threeGrammy Awards.
52]On an episode of the children's television showSesame Streetthat aired in April 1973,[53]Wonder and his band performed "Superstition", as well as an original called "Sesame Street Song", which demonstrated his abilities with television.Wonder performing in 1973, during the early years of his "classic period"Innervisions, released in 1973, featured "Higher Ground" (No.
4 on the pop charts) as well as the trenchant "Living for the City" (No.
8).
49]Both songs reached No.
1 on the R&B charts.
Popular ballads such as "Golden Lady" and "All in Love Is Fair" were also present, in a mixture of moods that nevertheless held together as a unified whole.
54]Innervisionsgenerated three more Grammy Awards, includingAlbum of the Year.
52]The album is ranked No.
34 onRolling Stone's500 Greatest Albums of All Time.
55]Wonder had become the most influential and acclaimed black musician of the early 1970s.
45]On August 6, 1973, Wonder was injured in a serious automobile accident while on tour inNorth Carolina, when a car in which he was riding hit the back of a truck.
45][56]This left him in a coma for four days and resulted in a partial loss of his sense of smell and a temporary loss of sense of taste.
57]Despite orders from his doctor to refrain from performing, Wonder performed at a homecoming benefit forShaw Universityin Raleigh in November 1973.
58]Shaw was facing financial difficulties, so Wonder, who was a member of the university's board of trustees, rallied other acts such asExuma,LaBelle, andthe Chambers Brothersto join the concert, which raised over $10,000 for the school's scholarship fund.
59]Wonder embarked on a European tour in early 1974, performing at theMidemconvention inCannes, at theRainbow Theatrein London, and on the German television showMusikladen.
60]On his return from Europe, he played a sold-out concert atMadison Square Gardenin March 1974, highlighting both up-tempo material and long, building improvisations on mid-tempo songs such as "Living for the City".
45]The albumFulfillingness' First Finaleappeared in July 1974 and set two hits high on the pop charts: the No.
1 "You Haven't Done Nothin'" and the Top Ten "Boogie on Reggae Woman".
The Album of the Year was again one of three Grammys won.

66]In 1976, whenPaul Simonwon the Album of the Year Grammy for hisStill Crazy After All These Years, he wryly noted, "I'd like to thank Stevie Wonder, who didn't make an album this year.
67][68]The double album-with-extra-EP,Songs in the Key of Life, was released in September 1976.
Sprawling in style and sometimes lyrically difficult to fathom, the album was hard for some listeners to assimilate, yet is regarded by many as Wonder's crowning achievement and one of the most recognizable and accomplished albums in pop music history.
45][49][69]The album became the first by an American artist to debut straight at No.

114]His "classic period", which culminated in 1976, was marked by his funky keyboard style, personal control of production, and use of integrated series of songs to makeconcept albums.

For me, it's the best album ever made, and I'm always left in awe after I listen to it.
When people in decades and centuries to come talk about the history of music, they will talk aboutLouis Armstrong,Duke Ellington,Ray Charlesand Stevie Wonder [...] he [Wonder] evolved into an amazing songwriter and a genuine musical force of nature.

 U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle honored Stevie Wonder with an award and a White House concert on Wednesday, crediting the Motown legend’s music for helping to bring them together.U.S.
President Barack Obama awards musician Stevie Wonder the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize at the White House in Washington February 25, 2009.
REUTERS/Jim YoungThe multi-Grammy winning soul singer was presented the Library of Congress’ second annual Gershwin Prize for Popular Song at the White House event in recognition of his music’s effect on culture and its ability to unite people.He was named the prize’s recipient in September, 2008.“We honor a man whose music and lyrics I fell in love with when I was a litte girl,” Michelle Obama said.
The first album I ever bought was Stevie Wonder’s ‘Talking Book.’”“Years later when I discovered what Stevie meant when he sang about love, Barack and I chose the song ‘You and I’ as our wedding song,” she added.The president also noted Wonder’s influence on his own life, praising his music’s universal appeal.“I think it’s fair to say that had I not been a Stevie Wonder fan, Michelle might not have dated me,” Obama said.“And I’m not alone,” he added.
Millions of people around the world have found similar comfort and joy in Stevie’s music and its unique capacity to find hope in struggle and humanity in our common hardships.”Guests and performers at the concert included soul singer India Arie, country artist Martina McBride, hip hop artist will.i.am and gospel duo Mary Mary, which Obama said reflected Wonder’s own cross-genre music style.“He’s created a style that is at once uniquely American, uniquely his own and yet somehow universal,” the president said.DREAM COME TRUEWonder, who was born in Saginaw, Michigan, became blind shortly after birth but learned to play the harmonica, piano and drums by age 9.At the age of 12, after moving to Detroit, he was given a recording contract by Motown Records, going on to deliver 32 No.
1 R&B and pop singles, garner 25 Grammy Awards and sell more than 100 million records.Wonder, whose hits include “Superstition,” “I Just Called to Say I Love You” and “My Cherie Amour,” embarked on a concert tour last year that he said he hoped would spread a message of unity among all religions and races.The singer, who is a staunch Obama supporter, has been politically active over the years, advocating in 1983 for Martin Luther King Day to become a national U.S. holiday.At the concert, Wonder said Obama’s election made him believe that his children could “live that dream that Dr. King talked about so long ago.”The chart-topping singer also spoke of a possibility for world peace, if people could set aside hatred for love.“I’m looking forward to you doing that so in my lifetime I can write some more songs about love, about unity,” Wonder said.
And through those songs of passion, maybe I’ll be a part of creating some more of those babies,” he joked.The Gershwin Prize was set up to commemorate George and Ira Gershwin, the American songwriting team whose manuscript collections reside in the Library of Congress.It honours musicians for a lifetime of contributions to the field of popular music that helped bring diverse listeners together and fostered mutual understanding.The 2007 prize was awarded to Paul Simon.To read more about our entertainment news, visit our blog "Fan Fare" online atblogs.reuters.com/fanfareOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

PresidentsPets in ChiefYou won't believe some of the animals that presidents and their families have kept as furry friends.ByRose DavidsonWhen a cat jumped onto the stage while Jill Biden was giving a speech, the first lady fell in love with the fur ball.After the event,President Joe Bidenand his wife adopted the tabby and named it Willow after the first lady’s hometown of Willow Grove,Pennsylvania.
Now the feline lives in style at the White House alongside a German shepherd puppy named Commander.Willow, the Bidens' green-eyed tabby, explores the White House.Photograph by Erin Scott / The White House via APPlease be respectful of copyright.

But the first presidential kitties belonged toAbraham Lincoln—he even fed them off gold White House forks.HOWL TO THE CHIEFFormerPresident Barack Obama's daughters lobbied hard to get a pet.
It worked!
The president and first lady accepted a puppy as a gift from one of their friends, Senator Edward Kennedy.
The dog was a Portuguese water dog that they named Bo.
Then in 2013, the Obamas brought home a second Portuguese water dog, Sunny.Bo, the Obamas' dog, sits in the grass at the White House.Photograph by White House Photo, AlamyPlease be respectful of copyright.

Father and son lived in the White House—and so did their dogs.Millie was an English springer spaniel that was the first President Bush's family pet.
She gave birth to Spotty, who moved into the White House with the seocond President Bush!

The wife of John Quincy Adams, the sixth president, hadsilkworms.
Herbert Hoover, the 31st president, had anopossum.
And Calvin Coolidge, the 30th president, had araccoonnamed Rebecca that walked on a leash!Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president, was famous for his many pets.
His six kids hadsnakes,dogs, cats, a badger,birds, guinea pigs, and more.
When Roosevelt's son Archie got the measles, his brother Quentin thought a visit from the familyponymight cheer him up.
So Quentin put the animal on the White House elevator and brought him to Archie's upstairs room.First Lady Grace Coolidge holds the family's pet raccoon, Rebecca, at a White House event.Photograph by Herbert French, PhotoQuest, Getty ImagesPlease be respectful of copyright.

2]PresidentBarack Obamaand his family were given the malePortuguese Water Dogas a gift after months of speculation about thebreedand identity of their future pet.
2][8]The final choice was made in part because elder daughterMalia's allergies dictated a need for ahypoallergenicbreed.
Bo was occasionally called "First Dog".
1][2][3]In August 2013, Bo was joined bySunny, a female dog of the same breed.
9]Bo was named by sisters Malia and Sasha after their cousins' cat, First LadyMichelle Obama's father, and as a reference to the R&B musicianBo Diddley.
Bo's name was also Barack Obama's initials.Breed background[edit]Main article:Portuguese Water DogThe Portuguese Water Dog is originally from the Algarve region of Portugal.
Only 48 Portuguese Water Dogs were entered for Britain'sCruftscompetition in the year 2009[10]and the author ofThe New Complete Portuguese Water Dog, Kitty Braund, believes there are about 50,000 in North America.
11]Due to its fleecy coat of minimally shedding hair,[12]the Portuguese Water Dog is considered ahypoallergenic dog breed.
13]Breeding and original owners[edit]The Obamas with BoBred by Martha and Art Stern of Amigo Portuguese Water Dogs in Boyd, Texas,[7]Bo was a son of Watson—of the Rader family in Pittsburgh's Ambridge suburb—and Penny, belonging to Art and Martha Stern.
One of Bo's nine litter mates was SenatorTed Kennedy's dog named Cappy (Amigo's Captain Courageous); the litter was named "Hope and Change", in honor of Obama'svictory.
14][15]Bo's original buyer is unknown, but eventually they returned him to the Stern family; purchasing Bo required signing a contract to return him to his breeder if things did not work out.
Bo enrolled with Kennedy'sobedience trainerDawn Sylvia-Stasiewiczin Hume, Virginia on January 5, 2009.
16]Selection of the dog[edit]At his first press conference asPresident-elect, Obama was questioned by reporters as to which breed the family was looking to acquire; he replied, "We have two criteria that have to be reconciled.
One is that Malia is allergic, so it has to be hypoallergenic.
There are a number of breeds that are hypoallergenic.
On the other hand, our preference would be to get a shelter dog, but, obviously, a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me.
So—so whether we're going to be able to balance those two things, I think, is a pressing issue on the Obama household.
17]George Stephanopoulosasked Obama on television in early January what kind of dog they would get, and when, saying that he was passing on a question from Obama's daughters who were sitting in the control room.
Obama said "They seem to have narrowed it down to alabradoodleor aPortuguese water hound... medium-sized dog, and so, we're now going to start looking atsheltersto see when one of those dogs might come up.
18]Much was made by the public and press about the family's search for a dog.
On April 12, 2009, it was announced that the Obamas would soon accept a six-month-old Portuguese Water Dog puppy as a gift from Senator Kennedy.
The dog was reported to have visited the family some weeks earlier[19]in a secret meeting to gauge compatibility and purportedly referred to by staffers as "The Meeting".
However, the gift was not accepted until the dog officially arrived and moved in at theWhite Houseon Tuesday, April 14, 2009.
20]Immediately after he arrived, the family staged aphoto opwith Bo on the property'sSouth Lawn.
21]At the conference, Obama was asked if he would allow Bo inside theOval Office, to which he responded: "of course.
21]He also gave a nod to PresidentHarry Truman's quote "If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.
21]The White House website was later updated to include official pictures and biographical details of Bo.
2]Biographical details[edit]Bo wearing aleiupon his White House arrivalListed by the name "Amigo's New Hope" withAmerican Kennel Club's breed registry[22]and given the name "Charlie" by his original owners,[23]the puppy received his name from President Obama's two daughters,Malia and Sasha, in part after their cousins' cat andMichelle Obama'sfather's nickname Diddley; the dog is a namesake of singerBo Diddley.
24][25]In June 2009, the White House released a baseball card for Bo with his new official portrait on one side and tongue-in-cheek statistics on the other; information included the facts that Bo's favorite food is tomatoes and that he does not yet know how to swim.
The card was available by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the White House.
26][27][28]According to financial disclosure forms released by President Obama in 2010, Bo was purchased for $1,600 (equivalent to $1,990 in 2021).
29]As of August 2012, Bo was on a diet, though no other details were released (it was announced by the President during the Kids' State Dinner, where children from the states and territories who had won a contest to design healthy, appealing meals had lunch at the White House).
30]Bo's heritage[edit]The Obamas walking with BoThe Obamas had voiced a strong desire to adopt ashelter dog, but made no firm commitments.
31]In Summer 2008,Best Friends Animal Society, an animal welfare organization, gathered 50,000 signatures on a petition asking the family to adopt a shelter animal.
32]Bo was a gift through a breeder, not a shelter dog.
Dog expertCésar Millánstated Bo could be considered part of a larger group known as "rescue dogs".
He was unsuccessful in his first home when plans for him to provide companionship to an older female dog went awry; apparently his attempts tosuckleirritated her.
20][33]The Obamas pledged a donation to the DC Humane Society in a show of support for shelter dogs.
34]TheHumane Society of the United Statesreleased a statement thanking the Obamas "for taking in a second-chance dog," but discouraged employing breeders.
35]Reactions in the media[edit]Bo and Obama running through the east wing of theWhite HouseBo in March 2010The Washington Post's Manuel Roig-Franzia, granted exclusive access to Bo for his debut in print, described the puppy: "Bo's a handsome little guy.
Well suited for formal occasions at theWhite House, he's got tuxedo-black fur, with a white chest, white paws and a rakish white goatee.
36]People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals(PETA) described the family's choice to accept the gift of a puppy from a family friend as "disquieting" and publicly urged Obama to have Bo neutered, despite the dog having been neutered before the Obamas received him.
37][38]In anticipation of increased interest in the breed, the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America issued a statement requesting that members of the public considering obtaining the dogs "ensure that this breed fits their lifestyle", advising that the dogs' needs preclude their being left alone for long periods or boarded in kennels.
39]Immediately upon Bo joining the First Family, four children's books and aplush toydepicting him were slated for publication or manufacture.
40][41][42]On July 17, 2009,Ben Greenman, writing inThe New York Timesas Bo, reflected on his first hundred days in office.
43]In the final episode of theHistory Channel'sLife After People, aired March 16, 2010, the producers imagined what life would be like for Bo after the disappearance of humanity.
44]This program speculated that he would leave the White House, and live off seafood from the Chesapeake Bay.
45]Bo was also shown onDogs 101, as part of segment about the breed.
46][47]Bo appeared in the comic bookLockjaw and the Pet Avengersand on the television showsLate Night with Seth MeyersandEllen.
On Meyers' show, Bo was the subject of a "Barney Cam" parody in which he is shown to be shamelessly manipulating White House staffers and guests (such as by finding and planting classified information in the bag of a speechwriter who refused to give him treats).
48]Bo acquired the nickname "Bobama".
49][50][51]Kidnapping plot[edit]On January 8, 2016, a man named Scott Stockert fromDickinson, North Dakotawas arrested for allegedly trying to kidnap Bo afterUnited States Secret ServiceAgents discovered a12 gaugepump actionshotgun and abolt action.22 caliberrifle on the back of his pickup truck.
52]Death[edit]On May 8, 2021, the Obama family confirmed that Bo had died ofcancerinWashington, D.C.at the age of 12.

ByGrant RindnerPublished: Nov 16, 2020Save ArticleInstagram/@barackobamaFormer president Barack Obama has written extensively about his parents and family, and continues to tell their story inhis new memoirA Promised Land.His father, Barack Obama Sr., was a successful Kenyan economist, while his mother Ann Dunham was an accomplished  American anthropologist.Here's what we know about the pair, including how they met while studying at the University of Hawaii in 1960.
I am the son of a Black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas," former president Barack Obamafamously saidin a 2008 campaign speech in Philadelphia.
Obama wasn't the first president (nor the last) to have a parent born outside of the United States, but his status as the first bi-racial president and anunconventional childhood—which began in Honolulu, Hawaii, and included time in Seattle, and Indonesia—made his upbringing the subject of much attention.A Promised LandA Promised Land$24 at AmazonPer NPR, which excerptedA Singular Woman: The Untold Story of Barack Obama's Motherby Janny Scott, his mom, Stanley Ann Dunham (who went by Ann) and dad, Barack Obama Sr. met in 1960, and had their son in 1961.
Though the two were not together for long, their lives remained intertwined as each went on to successful careers in the worlds of academia and international development.As far back as a 2006 interview with Oprah, Obama spoke openly about his diverse family, joking about how different they looked from one another—andhis wife, Michelle Obama's, reaction to his diverse crew.More From Oprah Dailyplay iconThe triangle icon that indicates to play"Michelle will tell you that when we get together for Christmas or Thanksgiving, it's like a little mini-United Nations," he said.
I've got relatives who look like Bernie Mac, and I've got relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher.
We've got it all.
The lives (and travels) of Obama's parents have been central to his public life, dating back to the racist and unfounded"birtherism" movementthat alleged, without evidence, that Barack Obama was not a U.S. citizen and ineligible to serve as president.To better understand the history of our 44th president before reading his new memoirA Promised Land,we put together some key facts on the lives of Ann Dunham and Barack Obama Sr., the timeline of their relationship, and their role in President Obama's early life.Ann Dunham and Barack Obama Sr. met as students at the University of Hawaii.In 1960, Ann Dunham—who would go on to study anthropology—and Barack Obama Sr., a prodigious math student, were both attending the University of Hawaii and met in a Russian class.
Another NPR piece, this one citing Sally Jacobs'The Other Barack: The Bold and Reckless Life of President Obama's Father,notes that the two became enamored with each other fast, even though at the time, it was somewhat unclear whether Obama Sr. had technically divorced his first wife, Kezia Aoko.Per Scott, Dunham became pregnant in 1961, and she married Obama Sr. that year.
Their marriage was exceptional for happening "at a time when nearly two dozen states still had laws against interracial marriage.
After their baby was born, Dunham decided to go to Seattle with baby Barack to be around family, while Obama Sr. remained at school.Dunham's life has been mischaracterized, but she had a significant impact on the future president.View full post on InstagramAs Scott wrote inA Singular Woman,"The president's mother has served as any of a number of useful oversimplifications."
She explains that Dunham, who died long before her son became a national political star, has had many different identities projected upon her, from being portrayed as a "shy, small-town girl" or a "naive idealist" in Obama'sDreams from My Fatherto being perceived as a struggling single mother.In actuality though, according to Scott, she was not only an important, inspirational figure in her son's life, but also a teacher and a forward-thinking worker who helped with local development and "consulted on microfinance projects" in Indonesia.
He credits her with impressing upon him the importance upon one's duty to others — perhaps that the best thing that one can do is to give opportunities for others," Scott told NPR's Terry Gross.
And her work in many ways foreshadows his.
There was a period in 1979 where she was working in what her boss described to me as 'community development in Java.'
That's five years before he becomes a community development person in Chicago.
Per the Stanley Ann Dunham Scholarship Fund's website, Dunham finished school in 1967, and then got married to another international student at the University of Hawaii, Indonesian Lolo Soetro.
The family then moved together to Jakarta, where she started working on what would eventually be an anthropology master's degree.Related StoriesBarack Obama Reacts to Joe & Kamala's WinBarack Obama's Half Sisters and BrothersBarack on How Being President Affected MarriageAt the time, President Obama was just six years old, attending school in Jakarta and learning English while his mother worked.
She also had another child with her second husband, Maya Soetoro-Ng,one of what he would later learn were several of his siblings.After a few years, the young Barack ended up back in Hawaii to live with Dunham's parents while she continued working in Indonesia.
She remained in her son's life, but as Scott wrote, their geographic separation likely took a toll on her emotionally.During her career, Dunham made a major impact on the field of international development.Dunham's work has been praised extensively, and is now considered ahead of its time by many in the industry.
According totheIndependent,she spent three decades working in Indonesia for organizations like the Ford Foundation, the Asian Development Bank, and the U.S. Agency for International Development.
She specifically worked in microfinance, something that Indonesia still pioneers today, while also being an activist and supporter of citizen groups "opposed to the military dictatorship.
TheStanley Ann Dunham Scholarship Fundnoted that she also spent time in Pakistan doing microcredit loans for low-income women and craftspeople.
Towards the end of her life, she lived in New York and was an employee of Women's World Banking, which focuses primarily on offering assistance to women.In 2009,Obama spokeabout his mother's professional impact at the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting.
She was an anthropologist who dedicated her life to understanding and improving the lives of the rural poor, from Indonesia to Pakistan," he said.
She championed the cause of women's welfare and helped pioneer the micro-loans that have helped lift millions from poverty.
President Obama was even once given a book of his mother's work while on a visit to the Philippines,perTheWall Street Journal.Dunham died in 1995.According to the Stanley Ann Dunham Fund's biography, she passed away of ovarian cancer in 1995 at age 52 in Hawaii.President Obama has continued to speak about his mother and her extended family, who helped to raise him as a child, throughout his career.
He recently shared a photo of himself and his mother with a tribute to her on Instagram.View full post on Instagram"As I recount in my book,A Promised Land, my mother, Ann Dunham, was strong, smart, and marched to her own beat.
For her, the world offered endless opportunities for moral instruction," Obama wrote.
My sister Maya and I got early lessons about the struggle for civil rights, the impact of poverty on people around the world, and the importance of respecting other cultures and considering other points of view.
My mother believed that power came not from putting people down but rather through lifting them up,"Barack Obama Sr. was married several times, which became a source of legal drama after he passed.Peter Macdiarmid//Getty ImagesAs Sally Jacobs wrote inThe Other Barack, there was some ambiguity over whether Obama Sr. had ever divorced his wife Aoko, especially given that in the Luo culture they shared, ending a marriage was a complicated process.In 1964, Dunham filed for a divorce of her own, and the couple split up, with Obama Sr. moving back to Kenya.
He eventually returned to the States and married again.After he died from injuries sustained in his third serious car crash, his ex-wives and children went to the courts to figure out who were his true legal heirs.
Per Jacobs' book, there was "colorful legal drama, which went on for years, pitted the first wife against the fourth, the eldest son against the youngest, and generally divided the family into two warring camps.
Ultimately, a judge ruled that Aoko and Obama Sr. had legally divorced prior to his moving to the United States.It's been speculated that racism drove Obama Sr. to leave America, leading to him working as a Senior Economist for the Kenyan government.In a Politico piecethat draws from the immigration file on Barack Obama Sr. obtained byThe Arizona Independent,there is evidence of his encounters with American immigration officials who were part of the INS.
The writer posits that racism may have contributed to him leaving the country.Immigration officials were keeping close watch on Obama Sr. following his marriage to Dunham, and they even communicated with Harvard, where he was then studying, about pressing him on "his marital problems."
The Politico piece said that then, "Harvard gets back to the INS and reports that while the student has passed all his exams, the university is 'going to try to cook something up to ease him out.
Eventually, school officials told Obama that they ran out of money to cover his scholarship, which would lead to the end of his student visa.Elsewhere in the file, a woman who was likely the mother of his Obama Sr.'s third wife, Ruth Nidesand, called in and complained about her daughter agreeing to marry him.Eventually, he received his Doctorate in Economics, and,according toThe Barack H. Obama Foundation'swebsite, worked "with the Kenya Government as a Senior Economist in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning."
He also held jobs with Shell and the Central Bank of Kenya, per Jacobs.Obama Sr. died in 1982.As Jacobs wrote, Obama Sr. went back to Hawaii and spent a short amount of time with his son Barack before returning to Kenya.
He then suffered a pair of grisly car accidents, the first of which crippled him, and the later in 1982, which led to his death.At the time of his death, he was 46, and had eight children.President Obama was always curious about the specifics of his father's life, as were his many siblings and half-siblings.Joe Wrinn/Harvard University//Getty ImagesSpeaking toThe New York Times,President Obama opened up about the effect of barely knowing his dad, who the paper says he met "just once at 10 or 11.
I spent a lot of time trying to figure out, in the absence of an immediate role model, what it meant to be a man — or in my case, a Black man or a man of mixed race in this society," he said.President Obama has been candid about the impact that not being raised by his father has had in many facets of his life, including penning the bookDreams from My Fatherin 1995.
The memoir tells the story of the younger Barack's childhood.
and the questions he wondered about in relation to his father.
And, according to Jacobs, President Obama is one of four children of Obama Sr. to have written books that "are at least in part a rumination of the Old Man and his impact on their lives."
He's also open reflected that his upbringing led him to put a lot of thought and effort into how he's would raise his own daughters, and how he would behave as a husband.Both Barack Obama Sr. and Stanley Ann Dunham lived fascinating lives, and their impact on the world runs even deeper than simply being the parents of President Obama.For ways to live your best life plus all things Oprah,sign up for ournewsletter!Grant RindnerGrant Rindner is a culture and music journalist in New York.

244][245]In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged theSupreme Courtto rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases ofHollingsworth v. Perry(regardingsame-sex marriage)[246]andUnited States v. Windsor(regarding theDefense of Marriage Act).
247]Economic policyMain article:Economic policy of the Barack Obama administrationOn February 17, 2009, Obama signed theAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787billion (equivalent to $994 billion in 2021)economic stimuluspackage aimed at helping the economy recover from thedeepening worldwide recession.

258]On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisanBudget Control Act of 2011.
The legislation enforced limits on discretionary spending until 2021, established a procedure to increase the debt limit, created a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and established automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee did not achieve such savings.

governmentdefaulton its obligations.
260]The unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0 percent and averaging 10.0 percent in the fourth quarter.

268]U.S.unemployment rateand monthly changes in net employment during Obama's tenure as president[269][270]Job growth during the presidency of Obama compared to other presidents, as measured as a cumulative percentage change from month after inauguration to end of his termTheCongressional Budget Office(CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.
271][272]The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1million,[272][273][274]while conceding that "it is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.
271]Although an April 2010, survey of members of theNational Association for Business Economicsshowed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73 percent of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.
275]The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other originalNATOmembers by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end ofWorld War II.

Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review bySecretary of the InteriorKen Salazarand concurrent Congressional hearings.
He then announced a six-month moratorium on newdeepwater drillingpermits and leases, pending regulatory review.
282]As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.
283]Prior to the oil spill, on March 31, 2010, Obama ended a ban on oil and gas drilling along the majority of theEast Coast of the United Statesand along the coast ofnorthern Alaskain an effort to win support for an energy and climate bill and to reduce foreign imports of oil and gas.
284]In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he "would reject theKeystone XL pipelineif it increased carbon pollution [or] greenhouse emissions.
285][286]On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline.
287]It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.

292][293][294]Health care reformMain article:Healthcare reform in the United StatesObama called forCongressto pass legislation reforminghealth care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.
295]He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs.
His proposal was to spend $900billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as thepublic option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care.
It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage forpre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage.
The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.
296][297]Maximum Out-of-Pocket Premium as Percentage of Family Income andfederal poverty level, underPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, starting in 2014 (Source:CRS)[298]On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.
295]After public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivereda speech to a joint session of Congresson September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.
299]In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.
300]On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.
301][302]On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39.
303]On March 21, 2010, thePatient Protection and Affordable Care Act(ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212.
Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.
304]The ACA includeshealth-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expandingMedicaideligibility for people making up to 133 percentof thefederal poverty level(FPL) starting in 2014,[305]subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400 percentof the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum "out-of-pocket" payment for annual premiums will be from 2 percent to 9.5 percent of income,[306]providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishinghealth insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research.
According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.
307]Percentage of Individuals in the United States without Health Insurance, 1963–2015 (Source:JAMA)[308]The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-incomebrackets, taxes onindoor tanning, cuts to theMedicare Advantageprogram in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;[309]there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.
310]In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143billion over the first decade.
311]The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional.
On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote inNational Federation of Independent Business v. Sebeliusthat the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority.
312]InBurwell v. Hobby Lobbythe Court ruled that "closely-held" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under theReligious Freedom Restoration Actfrom regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives.
In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 inKing v. Burwellthat subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans "established by the State", as the statute reads.

Zelizer also notes the Democratic Party lost power and numbers of elected officials during Obama's term, saying that the consensus among historians is that Obama "turned out to be a very effective policymaker but not a tremendously successful party builder."
Zelizer calls this the "defining paradox of Obama's presidency".
478]TheBrookings Institutionnoted that Obama passed "only one major legislative achievement (Obamacare)—and a fragile one at that—the legacy of Obama's presidency mainly rests on its tremendous symbolic importance and the fate of a patchwork of executive actions.

The president last saw his father when he was 10, when Obama Sr. made a brief visit to Hawaii from Kenya, where he moved when the future president was just a toddler.But what was Barack Obama Sr. really like?
Biographer Sally H. Jacobs takes an in-depth look at his life — and his legacy — inThe Other Barack: The Bold and Reckless Life of President Obama's Father.The Childhood Of Barack Obama Sr.Jacobs tellsFresh Air's Dave Davies that the president's father grew up in an extremely strict household.
His father, Onyango, who later changed his name to Hussein, regularly beat his wives and children with a four-pronged whip.
He also forced his children to recite long lists of memorized facts before their meals.The Other BarackBy Sally H. JacobsHardcover, 336 pagesPublicAffairsList Price: $27.99Read An Excerpt"Barack Obama Sr. would have to recite his math tables while standing at the table before he could have any food," Jacobs says.
Math] was a relatively new concept for Onyango ... and he wanted his son to have this skill.
And when Obama Sr. later went to the village school, he was immediately recognized for his strong math abilities.
A principal described him to me as the smartest boy in the school," says Jacobs.
He was particularly good at math, even then.
That would become his trademark and he would go on to become an economist, but even as a boy he excelled with numbers.
In 1959, Obama Sr. went to study at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, in Honolulu, where he stood out for his fastidious dressing habits, his forays into public speaking and his fabulous dancing skills.
A woman who had known him in Hawaii told me of how she ... would go down to some of the famous nightclubs with him and start to dance," says Jacobs.
And everybody would watch because he was so beautiful on the floor — and also because he was a black man.
Blacks were very few in number in Honolulu and he was the first African student at the University of  Hawaii.
Meeting Stanley Ann DunhamA year after Obama Sr. enrolled at the university, he met Stanley Ann Dunham, a 17-year-old from Kansas who was studying Russian.
Both of them were quite taken with each other," says Jacobs.
This relationship picked up speed pretty quickly.
The president describes it in his own memoir[Dreams from My Father]of how drawn they were to each other.
And] in a fairly short time, she becomes pregnant.
Obama Sr. told Dunham that he had divorced Kezia Aoko, his wife in Africa, but that wasn't true.
He also did not reveal that he had had two children with Aoko, who, like Obama Sr., was a member of the Luo ethnic group.If Obama the president had had [Barack Obama Sr.] as a father, I think it's fair to say that he wouldn't be the president.Biographer Sally H. Jacobs"The thing you have to understand about this is that it was deeply rooted in Luo culture," says Jacobs.
Divorce wasn't common.
You could get a divorce but you had to go through a very complex process which involved the couple sitting before a council of elders and then there had to be a return of the dowry.
Later on, Obama Sr. told immigration officials that he thought of himself as divorced in Kenya before he arrived in the United   States.
Jacobs says that Obama Sr.'s immigration files also show that Obama Sr. and Dunham may have considered putting President Obama up for adoption before he was born.
I [made a Freedom of Information Act request for] his immigration file because I wanted to confirm the date he arrived in the United States," she says.
In this record, there was an extraordinary memo in which the foreign student adviser at the University  of Hawaii has ... realized [Obama Sr.] might have two wives.

And he says, 'Don't worry, my wife is pregnant.
But she's making arrangements with the Salvation Army to give the baby up,' " says Jacobs.
Now did that really happen?
It's not clear.
Members of the family on both sides say they've never heard of it ... [But] Obama Sr. had every reason to not want to have that baby in his life at the time.
He was, at the time, up for the renewal of his visa.
The last thing they were going to look kindly on, if they chose to see it this way, was a bigamist with a mixed-race baby.
So Obama Sr. would say that the baby was going to vanish and that baby would be the [future] president of the United States.
The Birth of Barack Obama Jr.Of course, that baby didn't vanish.
Shortly after Dunham gave birth to Barack Obama Jr. on Aug. 4, 1961, in Honolulu, she moved with him to Seattle.
Obama Sr. stayed in Hawaii, leaving a year later to go to Harvard University for a graduate fellowship in economics.
In 1964, Dunham filed for divorce.
That same year, Obama Sr. returned to Kenya, which had just obtained its independence the year before, and got a job in management at Shell.
Obama [Sr.] makes it less than a year," says Jacobs.
He wasn't fired exactly, but he was not asked back.
So he left Shell and gets another potentially terrific job — this one at the Central Bank of Kenya.
Again, he runs into trouble within months.
He shows up late, he drinks on the job, he has to borrow money and he is asked to leave.

Jacobs has been a reporter for more than 30 years, most recently withThe Boston Globe.She specializes in  political reporting and profiles.Angson C. Dhlakam/Obama Sr. returned to the U.S. in 1971 because his life was falling apart.
A third wife was planning to leave him, he had no job and he had suffered massive injuries in a car accident.
He spent a short amount of time with his son Barack Jr. in Hawaii and then returned to Kenya, where a second car crash cost him his legs.
In 1982, Obama Sr. was in a third car accident and died from his injuries.All of Obama Sr.'s children, Jacobs says, have had to come to terms with their complicated relationships with their father.
Five of his children have written soul-searching memoirs about Obama Sr., including the president's 1995 memoir,Dreams from My Father.
If Obama the president had had [Barack Obama Sr.] as a father, I think it's fair to say that he wouldn't be the president," she says.
I think he would have had to wrestle with a neglectful father, an insecure person and someone who probably would have prevented him from following the path he close.
InDreams,you feel Obama Jr. struggling with [questions like] 'Who am I?
What kind of a man am I?
What will I be?'
The person he comes out as is clearly very determined and rooted and a responsible person — everything that Obama Sr. was not.

JacobsThe Other BarackBy Sally H. JacobsHardcover, 336 pagesPublicAffairsList Price: $27.99Read An ExcerptLate on a November evening in 1982, Obama [Sr.] was driving home when he rammed his white pickup truck headlong into the high stump of a eucalyptus tree at the side of the road and died instantly.
He was forty six.Obama's eight children, some of whom had not seen him for years, largely closed the door on the subject of their father.
For better or worse, the Old Man was gone.A quarter-century later another Barack Obama emerged, this one a cerebral U.S.
Senator from Chicago who was angling, quixotically it seemed, for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. presidency.
As that heavily laden name dominated the headlines and the nightly news, it triggered a flood of complex emotions among some of the elder Obama's children.They were struck at how oddly the younger Barack's name was pronounced.
The Old Man had also been called Barack, but his was a working man's name, with the emphasis on the first syllable.
The American pronunciation was heavy on the second syllable, giving the name a more formal, somewhat aristocratic cast.
This particularly amused the elder Barack's three surviving wives—not that they were talking to each other.Reporters scoured the younger Obama's background, and questions invariably arose about his namesake and the Kenyan family he had met on a handful of occasions.
The phenomenon of Obama's candidacy and the worldwide prominence that his name achieved after he became America's first African American president prompted some of the children to begin rethinking their relationship with the Old Man and to grow curious about the elements of his chaotic life.
Somehow they were all bound by that restless, bespectacled onslaught of a man who was their father and now to this gentler but no less intense version of him on the front pages of America's newspapers.The questions led to more questions.
Who was their father?
And who, for that matter, were really his children?
To get to the truth of the man, how could any of them penetrate the skein of lies and half-truths he had woven?
Even the makeup of his immediate family was a confounding jumble.Three years after his death some of his children and wives became embroiled in a legal brawl aimed at establishing exactly who his legitimate heirs were and to which of his "wives" had he actually been married.The colorful legal drama, which went on for years, pitted the first wife against the fourth, the eldest son against the youngest, and generally divided the family into two warring camps.
At the heart of the matter was a claim by Obama's first wife, Grace Kezia Aoko Obama, that she had never divorced her husband and remained married to him at the time of his death.
If that were true, then none of his subsequent three marriages—including the one with the president's mother—would have been legitimate.
A host of family members who took sides on the issue provided conflicting affidavits peppered with name-calling and insults.Even Obama's sixty-seven-year-old mother, frail and heartbroken over her first son's death, weighed in and declared that Grace had long ago divorced her son.3 The Nairobi High Court judge considering the dizzying squabble apparently believed Obama's mother: In 1989 Judge J. F. Shields ruled that not only had Grace divorced her husband but also that two of the four children she claimed he had fathered with her were not his sons at all.4And that was just the first phase of the battle.The name of Barack Hussein Obama II, the second son, crops up only incidentally in the bulging pink case files in Nairobi's High Court.
No one in the case ever challenged the legitimacy of his paternity.
But in July 1997 Barack Hussein Obama of Chicago, Illinois, deftly extracted himself from the matter with a brief letter to the court disavowing any claim he might have on the estate, which was worth about 410,500 Kenyan shillings, or $57,500, at the time his father died.
He wrote the letter six months after he was sworn in to serve his first term in the Illinois Senate representing the 13th district.Nearly a decade earlier, in the summer of 1988, Obama had launched his own effort to uncover the father about whom he had often wondered.At the time, his father had been dead for six years and he had just completed work as a community organizer in Chicago and was preparing to enter Harvard  Law School.
During a five-week visit to Kenya, Obama met many members of his sprawling clan for the first time and listened to their stories of his father's political frustrations and domestic travails.
He also found that many of his relatives had no greater command of his father's essence than he had gleaned from his mother's recollections.
The elder Obama seemed a baffling mystery to many with whom he had lived and worked, including his disparate tribe of children.Although he was a master of the verbal parrying and one-upmanship that are the Luos' stock in trade and was famous for his legendary black velvet baritone, the elder Obama confided in virtually no one, not even those in his wide circle of drinking comrades.
Talk of personal matters, and certainly of children, he considered to be a show of weakness.
He mentioned the son he had fathered while in Hawaii to only a handful of his closest friends and family members, even though he kept a photograph of that little boy, riding a tricycle with a small cap perched jauntily on his head, on his bureau.
Taken a couple of years after he had left his small family in Hawaii, the picture always followed him through his many moves and dislocations.His children may have understood him least of all.
As Auma Obama, President Obama's half-sister, says in Dreams from My Father, "I can't say I really knew him, Barack.
Maybe nobody did .
. . not really.
His life was so scattered.
People only knew scraps and pieces, even his own children."
Some of his children have pored over the letters and papers their father left behind, trying to pull all those inconclusive scraps and pieces together.Four of the five children indisputably fathered by Barack Obama have written books that are at least in part a rumination of the Old Man and his impact on their lives.
Like Dreams from My Father, each of the works is a yearning of sorts, an effort to make some sense of their father's character and complex legacy.Only his firstborn son, Abong'o Malik Obama, a volatile fifty-three-year-old who lives with his three wives near the family's compound in western Kenya, has not written a book about his father—at least not yet.Malik recently made headlines of his own when he took a nineteen-year old schoolgirl as his third wife.
He has also irritated some Obama family members when he built a small mosque on his property that the steady parade of tourists heading to the Obama compound pass daily.
Some Obamas worry that such a glaring symbol of the family's Muslim faith will negatively impact the Obama presidency.
Malik has accused others of trying to profit from his father's life and says that he intends eventually to write the definitive biography of his father himself.Auma Obama, Obama's only daughter and the second of his children born to his first wife, Grace Kezia, has painful recollections of a distant father who rarely spoke to her and often returned home from work drunk and irritable.8 But as she read some of the newspaper accounts of his life, she found she wanted to understand more about the forces that shaped his experience and left him so embittered.
She called Peter Oloo Aringo, a longtime friend of Obama's and then a member of Kenya's Parliament representing the Alego district where he spent his childhood, who recalled that Auma was "very troubled about [her father's] life.
She had spent more time with him than most of the children, but she felt she had not known him at all.
She wanted to know how we had gotten along, how we had been friends, that kind of thing.
But mostly she wanted to understand what had led to his downfall.

The numerological total of the words "Barack Obama" is 8.Thadhani says that the election results were announced on the 4th day of November 2008 making Obama the 44th President of USA.
Moreover, Democrat Obama's campaign harping on 'change' that totals 4 and he successfully changed America's destiny, Thadani reveals.Thadani has also tried to explain the numerological effect on Obama's Republican rival John McCain, whose name also totals 8 according to numerology and who is 71 years old (total 8).Unfortunately, McCain was not supported by his birth number as he is born on the 29th of August 1936 and his destiny number is 2, which does not go well with 4 or 8 according to Thadhani.Since the President's term in office is four years, Thadhani, who believes that destiny shows its hand through numbers, is willing to put his money on a second term for Obama totaling to 8.Thadhani, however, throws a word of caution as the compound number of Obama is 26, which will make him prone to treachery, deception and betrayal from his colleagues and danger from unknown persons as well.... contd.Page :12Single Page FormatTags:mumbaiuspollsALSO READ500 killed in South Sudan after coup attemptPlease read ourterms of usebefore posting commentsTERMS OF USE: The views expressed in comments published onindianexpress.comare those of the comment writer's alone.

Obama's lucky numbers - CNN.comObama's lucky numbersStory HighlightsChallenged by recession, piracy, flu, Obama can take heart from lucky numbers100 days since coming to office, most agree Obama has made impressive start75 percent of Americans believe Obama has presidential qualitiesObama looks set to achieve the 60 Senate seats he needs to pass legislationNext Article in Politics »By  Jonathan MannCNN(CNN)-- Don't call him lucky.
Barack Obama assumed the presidency of the United States just in time to be challenged by a painful recession, African pirates and a disease spread by pigs.
But he can at least take comfort in some lucky numbers.Obama has been self-assured, energetic and ambitious in his first 100 days in office100 --Obama marked a traditional milestone for new chief executives this week: the first 100 days since he took office.
Whether or not you agree with his policies, Obama's been self-assured, energetic and ambitious.
He's spending boldly to help the economy and breaking with Bush administration policy on issues ranging from Guantanamo Bay to global warming.
Whatever else happens, historians will probably credit him with a decisive debut.75-- Obama didn't have an especially easy time convincing Americans he was the right man to be president.
He won with about 53 percent of the vote.
But this week's CNN/Opinion Research Poll found that 63 percent of Americans support him and fully 75 percent say he has the personal qualities a president needs.
Americans don't all agree with him, but a solid number admire him nonetheless.Don't MissSpecial:State of the NationSpecial:First 100 DaysLatest:Political Ticker60-- Despite his support from voters, the Congress has been a problem for Obama.
A governing party needs 60 of the Senate's 100 seats to be sure it can pass the legislation it wants.
The Democrats won 58 and expect to capture a 59th because of one close Senate election that will be decided by the courts.
This week, Republican Arlen Specter switched parties.
The court's ruling remains to be seen, but Obama stands to get his 60.0-- Obama is the undisputed leader of the United States and its Democratic Party.
Who really speaks for the Republicans?
After presidential candidate John McCain lost the election, he lost the right to speak for the party.For the time being, the Republicans have no national figure who commands anywhere near the public support or media attention Obama does.
Right now, President Obama wins any contest of leadership with the Republicans by a 1-0 shutout.Maybe we should call him lucky, after all.E-mail to a friendShare this on:MixxFacebookTwitterDiggdel.icio.usredditMySpaceStumbleUpon|Mixx it|ShareFrom the Blogs:Controversy, commentary, and debateSit tight, we're getting to the good stuffpowered bySphereTop NewsSenators 'troubled' after Rice meetingBergen: Senseless Benghazi obsession

Protected by CopyscapeLet me try to be as objective as I can be when describing Barack Obama's numerology chart.This is difficult not so just due to the fact that he is my choice for president, or because I like him as a human being, but because his is the quintessential politician's chart.
Like him or not, this man was meant to be in politics.Three numbers are considered particularly favorable for politicians: the 1, the 2, and the 9.The1represents leadership, courage, drive, ambition and persistence, as well as a tendency to be stubborn and, at times, confrontational.
The2is tact, diplomacy, and an uncanny ability to maintain or restore harmony and peace.
On the downside, the 2 can be overly sensitive and given to mood swings.
The 9 is all about global awareness, compassion, duty, and self sacrifice, but the9can also be aloof and distant, if not a little arrogant.Barack Obama's core numbers are a2 Life Path, a9 Heart's Desire, and a 1 both as anExpressionand aPersonalitynumber.And it doesn't end there.
If I were to custom-design a leading politician's chart and then bring him to life, I might throw in a bonus in the form of a4, just to add managerial skills and efficiency, discipline, a down-to-earth attitude, stability, and trustworthiness.
And would you believe Obama has a4 Birth Day?A finely tuned chart such as Obama's also has its challenges, of course.
Any time you find both the 1 and the 2 among a person's core numbers, there's going to be strive and discordance, which can only be overcome through effort and discipline, but it doesn't come easy.
There is no doubt in my mind that Barack Obama in his earlier years, especially during his teenage years and his twenties, often felt himself torn between his confrontational, impatient, goal-oriented, even aggressive 1 Expression, and the more sensitive, considerate, peace-loving, non-confrontational 2 Life Path.
It is, however, the locations of the 1 and 2 respectively that save the day and helped him find a useful, practical balance between these two opposing numbers.An often-overlooked aspect of numerology, even by many professionals, is the fact that theLife Pathrepresents a cycle (from birth to death) and is therefore truly a "path."
It's not a destiny, it's not a package of personality traits, and it doesn't define character so much as it defines a learning pattern.
It's evolution at work.
A 2 Life Path tells us that as the years go by Barack becomes a little better at "being" a 2, since life itself - it's circumstances and environment - deliver the lessons and experiences necessary to fulfill one's Life Path.
Obama becomes more intuitive, patient, diplomatic, and sensitive as he gets older, because those are the specific traits life is busy teaching him.The number 1 appears both as an Expression number and a Personality number.
TheExpression numberis the clearest indicator of our vocational talents and as such, the tendency to take charge, tackle problems head on, try new methods, push ideas through no matter how much resistance, dominate debates, and be as unstoppable as required, are all generously represented in the personality of Barack Obama.
His 2 Life Path may make him choose a diplomatic approach but behind that is the steely determination of the 1.
He is, as they say, not the kind of guy you want to mess with.
Fortunately, his1 Personalitymakes that clear to anyone who meets him, because those traits are right there on the surface, he doesn't hide them.In a numerology chart, as in Real Estate, location is everything.
The fact that you have a 7 or a 1 or a 5 means absolutely nothing.
What matters is WHERE you have a7or a 1 or a5.
The aforementioned 9 core number in Barack's chart is found as aHeart's Desireand its effect is exactly that: it tells us what most prominently satisfies the desires of his heart.
In Obama's case, he is basically a typical "do-gooder."
Yes, whether you agree with his ideas or not, this man is motivated first and foremost by a desire to improve the quality of life for mankind.
The 9 is the Mother Theresa number and no politician should be without a 9 Heart's Desire as there simply can't be a more legitimate motivation to be in politics then a need to have a positive impact on the world and its inhabitants.
Mind you, that doesn't mean the ideas or concepts of what would improve our lives are always good, but at least the motivation behind them is genuine.Other numbers in Obama's chart worth mentioning, are a3as hisMaturity number, his 7Balance number, and his 1Hidden Passion.His 3 Maturity number is beneficial for two main reasons: already a great communicator, he just becomes better and better as he gets older, but perhaps more important for Obama himself, the older he gets the easier it becomes for him to "lighten up," to let go of the burdens of responsibilities now and then, to simply enjoy being around friends and family.
It becomes easier to just be happy and optimistic when you have a 3 Maturity number.His 7 Balance number gives us some insight in how he deals with important issues; he turns inward where he analyzes and contemplates and weighs pros and cons in search of answers.
Obama needs a quiet place, especially during particularly turbulent times, because it's in deliberation, more than in debate or the advice and opinions of others, that Obama finds the confidence to make decisions.
His 7 Balance number is, however, based on a16, which tells us that he is no stranger to self doubt or fear of failure.
Fortunately, with six 1s in his name - giving him a 1 Hidden Passion - that's pretty well balanced by the in-born faith and self-confidence typical to a 1 Hidden Passion.
The occasional moments of self-doubt and insecurity brought on by the 16 therefore generally don't have any lasting negative influence.
It's just enough to help him remember that he may be a big man in the arena of American politics and the global community we call mankind, but in the eyes of the Creator he is like any other human being and as such can be no larger than his or her consciousness allows.I know, that's all pretty good, right?
All that positive stuff about Obama.
And you're thinking I'm pushing an agenda here, trying to sell you an idealized version of Obama.
Perhaps I am, because as far as I am concerned, objectivity is for robots and androids.
The reality is though, that this is his chart and it's a good one.I trust that when you are ready to vote, you will base your choice on whether or not Obama's ideas and convictions are better than the other guy's.
As far as his ability to be the president he wants to be, you don't have to doubt the strength of his convictions or the integrity of his idealism; they are what they are.It is now 10 years later and a guy namedTrumphas occupied the White House for almost two years.

Body language of Modi at BRICSWhile Barack Obama is the worldâ€™s powerful man, his numerology predictions tells a dangerous tale of numbers 4 and 8 coming together.
Read below to know moreWhile Barack Obama is the worldâ&#128;&#153;s powerful man, his numerology predictions tells a dangerous tale of numbers 4 and 8 coming together.
Read below to know moreEveryone has their eyes on the world’s most powerful man – Barack Obama.
Currently serving his second presidential term, there is a huge amount of curiosity and intrigue surrounding Mr Obama.
What is more intriguing is the President’s numerological forecast – it is at once strange and dangerous!Born on 4th August, 1961, his psychic number is 4 and destiny number is 2.
People born under number 4 are known to be unpredictable as one can never be sure of their next move.
What goes on in their mind or what their thoughts are – only they themselves are privy to it!
However, the number 4 can bring about many sudden changes in one’s life and those born under this number have to face many ups and downs.Barack Obama has a Moon in his destiny, representing the moody and secretive nature of his personality.
Born under number 4, he loves everything beautiful and gives a lot of importance to his family and home.Since his psychic number is 4, it was a natural choice for him to fall in love in with a woman who born under number 8 as with other number 4s who get attracted to 8, 4 and 1.
Michelle Obama was born on 17th January, 1964, making her psychic number 8.Mrs Obama’s name number is 44, i.e.
double 4s of Uranus leading to Saturn’s 8.
The quaint relationship between both the numbers, i.e.
4 and 8 is exhibited in this name.
The double ‘4s’ suggest fatality, dignity and strength.
Greed usually brings about the downfall of this number.The name number for Barack Obama is 26 which is again ruled by Saturn and is not considered a good number innumerology.
This is so unless a strong Saturn is placed in the horoscope.
Like Tom Cruise, Obama too has a sun placed in his horoscope.
Yet, the number 26 is on the unlucky side as it creates, in this case indicates a disturbed youth and pain in childhood.
It also indicates a separation of parents, bad habits like sexual promiscuity, alcoholism, smoking, and yet, number doesn’t stop a person from becoming rich or powerful.The American President like many teens faced troubled teenage years.
He became a cocaine addict to forget his psychological worries.
The number 26 can cause much sadness when associate with a number 4 in the date of birth.Further, number 26 which is ruled by Saturn indicates those born under it can get onto the wrong path or do illegal work. .
It foreshadows disasters brought about by association with others; ruined by bad speculation, unions and advice.
He will make dangerous enemies in his life.
With 26 as his name, it is even quite possible for him to face many attacks on his life.Both, the name numbers of Barack – 26 and Michelle – 44 can bring about sudden fatal events.
For e.g.
Michael Jackson and Pramod Mahajan were famous 44′s.
In short, there is good chance of a fatal adventure in Obama’s life.Start a ConversationFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIAFacebookTwitterInstagramKOO APPYOUTUBEVisual Stories6 Zodiac Signs Who Are Drama QueensastrologyYour Lucky Colour As Per Your Zodiac Signastrology6 Zodiac Signs Who Can Not Keep A SecretastrologyWomen Of These Zodiac Signs Are Controlling In A RelationshipastrologyZodiac Signs Most Likely To Win All Competitionsastrology5 Planets That Will Be Visible In The Night Sky On March 28, 2023astrology​Worship Goddess Durga according to your zodiac signastrologyZodiac Signs Who Don't Like To Follow Any RulesastrologyZodiac Signs Who Have A Great Luck In Loveastrology6 Zodiac Sign Pairs That Secretly Like Each Otherastrology123ElectionsKarnataka Congress Candidates ListElections 2023Assembly Elections 2023Karnataka Elections 2023Mizoram ElectionsChhattisgarh ElectionsMadhyaPradesh ElectionsTelangana ElectionsTOP TRENDSKKR vs RCB Live ScoreKarnataka Congress Candidates ListJagarnath Mahto DeathPSEB 5th Class Result 2023Covid Cases in IndiaCoronavirus NewsTrending StoriesIn AstrologyEntire WebsiteHoroscope Today, April 6, 2023: Read your astrological predictionsHoroscope Today, April 5, 2023: Read your astrological predictions for Aries, Taurus, Cancer, Gemini and othersHoroscope Today, April 4, 2023: Read your astrological predictions for Aries, Taurus, Cancer, Gemini and othersHoroscope Today, April 3, 2023: Read your astrological predictions for Aries, Taurus, Cancer, Gemini and othersHoroscope Today, April 1, 2023: Read your astrological predictions for Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer and othersFestivals in April 2023: Check Calendar of the monthHoroscope Today, March 31, 2023: Read your astrological predictions for Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn and othersHoroscope Today, March 30, 2023: Read your astrological predictions for Vigo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius and othersRam Navami 2023: Date, Shubh Muhurat, History, Puja Vidhi, Celebration and SignificanceDurga Ashtami 2023: Date, Shubh Muhurat, Puja Vidhi, Colour, Mantras and SignificanceLaid-off by big companies & startups, techies struggle for jobsAnil Antony joins BJP; pained by son's decision, says AK AntonyAn outsider's guide to politics, numbers and fight for KarnatakaGovt recommends CBI probe into 'FCRA violations' by Oxfam IndiaIPL Live: Shardul Thakur, Rinku Singh lead KKR run chargeVedanta's Anil Agarwal's chip dream at risk as hurdles mountHow to invest in this new financial yearGovt announces new rules for online gaming: What's banned and other detailsFrom Greece to Magadh, new history chapters to be added in 2024Live: Maharashtra reports 803 new Covid cases, Delhi logs 606 fresh infectionsAbout usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal PolicyPrivacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamEi SamayI am GujaratTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMiss KyraMumbai MirrorBangalore MirrorPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth & Fitness TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosHot on the WebHanuman Jayanti 2023 WishesDisha PataniParineeti ChopraShraddha KapoorVegetable PeelsRashmi GautamAlia BhattHealthy Ragi DosaSouth Movie Remake In BollywoodNeha SharmaTop TrendsKKR vs RCB Live ScoreKarnataka Congress Candidates ListJagarnath Mahto DeathPSEB 5th Class Result 2023Covid Cases in IndiaCoronavirus NewsIndian Railway RulesIPL Live ScoreAnil AntonyPadma Awards 2023Hanuman Jayanti 2023Karnataka ConstituenciesSamastha Exam ResultBank Holidays in AprilBreaking NewsKarnataka Elections 2023IPL Schedule 2023IPL Points Table 2023Trending TopicsShah Rukh KhanRelationships TipsAbdu RozikHanuman Jayanti 2023 QuotesDisha PataniThe Kapil SharmaSanju SamsonBaby NameParenting TipsIndia Best PlacesWeight LossMouni RoyPoonam BajwaBigg Boss 5 MalayalamMadhuri DixitRashmika MandannaVivo Y55sLaptops under 30000WiFi RoutersTablets under 15000Living and entertainmentiDivaMensXP.comFeminaETimesGraziaZoomTravel DestinationsBombay TimesCricbuzz.comFilmfareOnline SongsTVLifestyleLongwalks AppNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaMagicbricksTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgets NowCareersColombiaCopyright © 2023 Bennett, Coleman & Co.

A  Numerology Perspective:Let us Look at his numbersBirth Date number= 4=Rahu/Uranusor call it dragon’s head.His Month Number= 8= August=SaturnHis Sun Sign Number and Sun Sign=Leo, ruled by Sun= number 1Name Number:BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMAB(2) + A(1) + R(2) + A(1) + C(3) + K(2) = 11H (5)+  U(6)+   S (3)+  S(3) +   E(5) +  I(1)+   N(5) = 28O(7) + B(2) + A(1) + M(4) + A(1) = 15Total= 54= planetMARSHis basic Nature:His basic Nature is controlled by  RAHU( birth date =4), Sun sign(LEO , ruled by sun), His Month number=8 /Saturn and His Name Number= 9(Mars).Rahu , the number 4 gives him the un conventional nature to struggle against odds, be efficient to rise to this level and yes support for the underdog- that is the African Americans.
It also gives him efficiency in handling money.We know he has been very efficient, handling and trying to revive American economy and yes he has a strong appeal to the underprivileged people in USA especially the  African Americans.Rahu (number 4) gives ability to stand against the crowd and success in politics.
All is True for Mr. Obama!Some noteworthy points for his birth date =4He was the 44thpresident of USA; can you see the double 4’s in 44?
It shows strong influence of Rahu(number 4)Also 44 is 4 X11, ad 11 = leadership and inspiration- so this combination gives him the master leader ad hardwork capability.Now Law is ruled by Jupiter, but Law breakers are ruled by RAHU(number 4), we know as per Wikipedia “He worked as aattorney and taught constitutional law University of Chicago Law Schoolfrom 1992 to2004”He served the13thdistrictof Illinois senate from 1997 to 200 Note 13 = 1+3= 4= Rahu/Dragons head and 2004( the turning point has 4/rahu as ending)Wikipedia says “running unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representativesin 2000.”,Note 2000 is = 2+0+0+0= 2=MOON.
RAHU(number 4) and MOON(number 2) don’t go very well together.
So more chances of failure.Regarding his getting re-elected as president- “The2012 re-election campaign of Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States, was formally announced onApril 4, 2011”Mark theDate is 4th=RahuandAprilMonth=April= 4th= Rahuandyear = 2011= 2+0+1+1 = 4=Rahu!So we have 3 Rahu’s for his succession sitting there!!
His struggle and Rise to President shipBeing Born in sun sign of Leo gives him enough leadership skills along with Rahu( birth date =4), the sun and rahu combination gives him the exceptional leadership and innovative skills,.But at the same time as Sun represents father, and Rahu at times acts in opposition to sun, so he had to stay away from father.His Name Number =54, which does promise leadership and also planet mars( 5+4= 9 = Mars) gives him the extra throttle , energy and action to his sun and rahu(Leo= 1 and birth date= 4) to get him to a high position!His destiny number = 4 + 8 +1961(1+9+6+1 = 17/8) = 4+8+8 = 20= 2+0=2= MOON.
The planet of peace.
We know President obama was majorly a peace creator than interested in war.
He is an ace diplomat( moon quality), that world would remember.
He would continue to do his peace effort!!
His Lucky colour/number/datesLucky numbers:4,7Lucky colour:Grey colour and electric bluesLucky date:4,13,22,31Future Predictions:He would continue his peace keeping effort and connection to the society in future as well.
He might take  up spirituality or some deep spiritual path much more intensely .
he may travel also a lot.His birth number 4= rahu gives a chance of risk from fanatics and militants.
But now at this age the risk is very low- but still there.He has to be especially to be careful for his image, health and security for November, December and January 2015 start.We sincerely wish him a long and fruitful life.Get More LUCKY Now!Get your Lucky Numbers!Find out How Lucky is your Mobile Number.Get To know what kind of work would Suit You The Best!Find out if your House Number is Lucky!And much more…!Get More LUCKY Now!Through Your Numbers Using Science Numerology!CLICK HEREOther ArticlesWhy Astrology Should Be Treated As A Regular Science?Google CEO Sundar PichaiHoroscope,Numerology and Sun Sign analysisSwine Flu and Science of  Vedic AstrologyMAIN MENU Astrology & NumerologyArticlesShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Search for:Recent PostsPaypal Checkout 198$Astrology Nadi Career Job Jyotish PredictionsAstrology Nadi Personality, Destiny and Luck Vedic!Paypal Checkout – 89 $Astrology Karakamsha Eighth House Jaimini Horoscope KundliRecent CommentsK.

12, 2016  11:21 am ESTWhen asked what hisfavorite foodwas,President Obamadeclared "broccoli."
Obama's love of thesehealthy greenflorets stands in opposition to the food tastes ofGeorge W. Bush, who declared uponbecoming presidentthat he never wanted to seeanother broccoli floreton his plate ever again.So, now that we've established that Obamaloves his vegetables, and that he generally follows a very heathy diet (as enforced by Michelle's strict healthy eating rules),what food does he really hate?Besides his love of broccoli, Obama also lovesa good cheeseburger,a bowl of smoky, spicy chili, andthin-crust pizza, so it's definitely not the case that he hatesunhealthy food.
His most disliked food is actually something incredibly particular and, in our opinion, totally inoffensive, something which we would never have even thought about naming as our most hated food ever:mayonnaise.Click here to find out what Obama's favorite dishes really are.Yes, you heard us right.
That fairly bland,basic condiment, which isa fridge staplefor the majority of us, is so hated bythe presidentthat he refuses to go anywhere near the stuff.
We'd be surprised if you can finda jar of mayonnaiseanywherein the White House: Obama seems to treat it as if it were poisonous.
Fingers crossed forthe mayo-loversamong us that he keeps this ban on his own house and doesn't spread it across the rest of the country.Recommended

Broccoli?
Broccoli is your favorite food?
This isn’t even a reasonable category for broccoli to win.
Favorite vegetable, possibly.
Even then, it faces some stiff competition from carrots, artichokes — heck, arugula!
Possibly not peas or the much-maligned brussels sprout, which he admitted was “mushy.”) But favorite food?
That’s like saying that your favorite computer game is Microsoft Excel.But no, President Obama has calledbroccoli his favorite food.Sure, maybe he was just trying to steer recalcitrant children toward the tree-shaped vegetable — it was at a healthy-eating-based event, after all, and this is exactly the sort of tongue-in-cheek response you give to a child at that sort of gathering.
But still — how dare he?
Just when the sobering news came that America had lost its pride of place as the most overweight nation in the world.
He should be embracing bacon, wrapped in bacon, curled inside bacon, not rushing off to the arms of big vegetable.AdvertisementMore and more Americans are eating broccoli and, apparently,enjoying it— unlike former president George H. W. Bush.
Is Sarah Palin and her Big Gulp the only thing standing between us and a nation of broccoli-eating, bacon-shunning, elliptical-using healthy people?
There is nothing more annoying than healthy people, except possibly healthy people who Instagram pictures of their kale, or paying for the care of unhealthy people when their systems give out.Wasn’t pizza his favorite food during the campaign?
What happened to that?Then again, Congress did declarepizza a vegetable, so maybe he’s come full circle.GiftOutlineGift ArticleLoading...TOP STORIESVisual StoriesTired of reading?

She created a now-famousvegetable gardenand took steps to help ensure that kids’ lunches steered clear of overly processed foods.
It therefore comes as no huge surprise that while she is no longer living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Mrs. Obama maintains a high degree of interest in all things cuisine.This month, Obama spoke toFood & Wineabout her favorite style of food (tapas), preferred childhood dish (mac and cheese), and more.
And while she had plenty to say about eating locally and getting moving, it was a certain dislike that really stood out.It turns out that there is one vegetable that evenMichelle Obamahates to eat.
What exactly is it?
No, it’s not broccoli, the veggie famously reviled by President George H.W.
Mrs. O. does not care for beets.
I know that I’m known for eating my vegetables, and there really isn’t much I don’t enjoy,” Obama told the magazine.
But I’m just not a fan of beets.”Apparently, the same goes for President Obama.
In 2012, Mrs. Obama said, “We believe there’s a beet gene.
You either love beets or you hate ’em.” We’re inclined to believe the first lady of healthy eating.
So were there ever any beets planted in that famous White House vegetable garden?

Read ourprivacy noticeIt seemed like a harmless question, but when you’re the 44th President of the United States there’s no such thing.
On Tuesday afternoon, Barack Obama turned up at the second annual Kids’ State Dinner, hosted by his wife, Michelle, and attended by the winners of her competition to create a healthy lunchtime recipe.
One of the 54 children at the event asked the President to name his favourite food, to which he replied, implausibly: broccoli.
Given his grasp of political history, Mr Obama must surely have known that broccoli was a hot potato.Click image above to enlarge graphicLike pasta and organised crime, broccoli was popularised in America by the Italians.
Brothers Stephano and Andrea D’Arrigo were the first to cultivate vast crops of the divisive brassica from their farm in San Jose, California during the 1920s – just in time to grace the lunch table of a young George HW Bush.
In 1990, Mr Bush famously banned broccoli from Air Force One, explaining, “I do not like broccoli... And I haven’t liked it since I was a little kid and my mother made me eat it.
And I’m President of the United States, and I’m not going to eat any more broccoli!”California broccoli farmers were outraged, and delivered a reported 10 tons of their product to the White House in protest.
The vegetables were donated to local homeless shelters.
During her husband’s campaign to unseat Mr Bush, Hillary Clinton was photographed holding a sign that read, “Let’s put broccoli in the White House again.” It’s commonly held that “the economy, stupid,” won Bill Clinton the 1992 election – but was it really the broccoli?More than 10 years after his father’s gaffe, George W Bush almost caused a diplomatic incident with his own dislike of the Democrats’ favourite vegetable.
On an official visit to Mexico in 2001, he stopped in at then-Mexican President Vicente Fox’s San Cristobal ranch, which sits adjacent to a large field of broccoli.
When reporters asked his opinion on the crop, Dubya gave it the thumbs-down, saying: “Make it cauliflower.” It is not clear whether he knew at the time that Fox’s family owned a substantial broccoli farm.Last year, broccoli again hit the headlines, as a symbol of President Obama’s controversial healthcare reforms.
During a debate about Obamacare in the Supreme Court, Justice Antonin Scalia suggested the Government’s new requirement that everyone purchase health insurance could open the door to grocery-store tyranny, by forcing everyone to purchase healthy food, too.
Everybody has to buy food sooner or later,” Scalia said.
Therefore, you can make people buy broccoli.”The first known use of the healthcare/broccoli analogy was in 2009, when the editor of CNS News asked in an op-ed, “Can President Barack Obama and Congress enact legislation that orders Americans to buy broccoli?” The answer, the Supreme Court decided, was ‘No’.
In the majority opinion approving the Affordable Care Act, Chief Justice John Roberts made special mention of broccoli.
Were Congress to force consumers to eat healthy foods, in order to reduce obesity and thus curb the costs of Obamacare, Roberts wrote that it would be a dangerous use of government power, and go against the laws and traditions of the US.Around 90 per cent of the country’s broccoli is grown in California, where the mix of warmth and fog suits the anti-carcinogenic crop down to the ground.
Washington’s disdain for the vegetable may stem, therefore, from its lack of freshness – most broccoli on DC dinner plates will already have suffered several days in trucks and warehouses.
Still, America is learning to love broccoli: US broccoli farming and sales of fresh broccoli have both increased substantially since the first Bush presidency.Mr Obama himself is a recent convert.
During the 2012 presidential election, his favourite foods were said to be the somewhat less healthy chilli, chips and pork chops.
In an interview last year, he also admitted a weakness for nachos.
If I get nachos and guacamole I can go to town on that stuff,” he said.
I asked my team to restrict my intake.
If they put it in front of me it’s gone.”So what swayed him to broccoli: Mrs Obama’s healthy eating advocacy, the White House chefs, or simply a national trend towards fresher, better prepared veg?
My family when they cooked vegetables, they would just boil them and they’d get all soft and mushy,” Obama told his audience at the Kids’ State Dinner.
Nobody wanted to eat a pea or a Brussels sprout because they’d be all mushy… But now I actually like vegetables, because they’re prepared right.”Power broccoli: For and againstThomas JeffersonThe third president of the US may well have been its first broccoli enthusiast.
He imported seeds from Italy to plant on his estate at Monticello in 1767.George H W BushThe elder Bush, the 41st US president, was fiercely anti-broccoli, banning it from Airforce One.
I do not like broccoli,” he said in 1990, “and I haven’t liked it since I was a little kid... I’m the President of the United States, and I’m not going to eat any more broccoli.”Hillary Clinton and Tipper GoreThe wives of the future president and vice-president headed a “Let’s put broccoli in the White House again” campaign in 1992.Silvio BerlusconiThe former prime minister and bunga-bunga enthusiast is one of several broccoli fans in Italian politics.George W BushGave a “thumbs down” to the broccoli of President Vicente Fox during a presidential visit to Mexico in 2001.Barack & Michelle ObamaThe president said this week that broccoli is his favourite food.
