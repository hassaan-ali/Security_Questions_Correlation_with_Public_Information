In a charming interview onEntertainment Weekly,his young costars, Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton are the ones asking the questions.About halfway through the interview, the pair ask Smith for advice he would give them for their future careers, and he responded by giving them the same message his own grandmother gave him when he was young.As he was stepping onhis tour busfor the first time, his grandmother told him,“‘Be careful how you treat people on your way up, because you might have to pass them again on your way down’ … That is so true… Be conscious of the people you are interacting with because you are going to see them over and over and over again … for the next decades of your career.”He then emphasized that the young actors are likely to run into the same interviewers, camera crews, and other behind-the-scenes people over the years, and the way they treat those people will follow them wherever they go.Will Smith’s early rap careerBefore becoming an actor, Smith first made a name for himself in music with his childhood friend Jeffrey Townes, better known asDJ Jazzy Jeff, who later played Jazz onThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.After meeting at a party in 1985, the pair decided to form a group that became DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, according toBiography.Their first single “Girls Ain’t Nothing But Trouble” became a hit in 1986, and their first album,Rock the House,brought Smith enough success to make him a millionaire before he was 18.Although Smith was an excellent student, he had no college ambitions, especially after the early success that came with his rap career.Smith and Townes were praised for their clean lyrics that contrasted other rappers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and their songs discussed relatable teen problems with a twist of humor that parents and teens could both appreciate.Smith’s and Townes’ successRelatedWhat Is DJ Jazzy Jeff of ‘DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince’ Up To Today?DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince saw significant success throughout their music career together, even garnering aGrammyAward for Best Rap Performance in 1989 for their hit song “Parents Just Don’t Understand”. Their most successful song, “Summertime”, was released in 1991 and earned them another Grammy Award.“Summertime” climbed the charts, eventuallypeaking at number fouron the Billboard Hot 100. Smith then transitioned to acting when NBC signed him on toThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Airin 1990.Although DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince haven’t released any new music together for quite some time, the pair haveremained close friends.DJ Jazzy Jeff even collaborated with Smith on his solo albums, and the duo was a fan favorite ofThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, especially after Townes became a series regular.Tags:Will SmithInstagramYoutubeFacebookTwitterAbout UsContact UsCareersEthicsFact checking commitmentCorrections commitmentOwnership funding advertising infoSportscastingEndgame360MotorBiscuit© Copyright 2023 Endgame360 Inc.

She is portrayed byVirginia Capers.CharacterHattie is the mother ofPhilip BanksandHilary,Carlton,AshleyandNicky's paternal grandmother. Hattie loves her grandchildren, and also bonds withWill, whom she seems to share love of fun with. She also is the only one who calls Phil "Zeke", which was his nickname growing up. She and her husband behave very much like rural Southerners, having owned a farm in North Carolina. They are both down to earth, calm and have good values.StoryHer first appearance is in the episode,Not with My Pig, You Don't, when she appears alongside her husbandJoe. When Phil is honored with a prestigious award, he believes people want to hear stories about guys rising up from the streets and graduating from college. His parents' recollections of his time on the farm are an embarrassment to him, because it makes him seem like a sheltered country bumpkin. When the press gets wind of his early life, it becomes a hit, but Phil is enraged. Will tries to get Phil to be proud of his early accomplishments, such as being the first black boy to get elected president of the local chapter of the Future Farmers. Phil, coming to realize there is no single or "right" way to success, gives a rousing speech at the awards dinner talking of his time on the North Carolina farm, but more importantly being gracious for both his parents being on hand to raise him, which not everyone gets.Hattie goes on to make several more appearances, most of them dealing with her relationship with her son and Will, who always tries to smooth the situation between them when it gets negative. She is a widow from "Granny Gets Busy" onward.She appears in a total of 6 episodes. Will calls her "Granny", Hattie and Will are without kinship.EpisodesNot with My Pig, You Don'tThe Young and the RestlessGranny Gets BusyThere's the Rub (Part 1)There's the Rub (Part 2)I, Ooh, Baby, BabyCategoriesCategories:CharactersFamilyCommunity content is available underCC-BY-SAunless otherwise noted.AdvertisementFan FeedMore The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air1Frederick Vickers2Lisa Wilkes3Jackie AmesExplore WikisUniversal Conquest WikiLet's Go Luna!

For other uses, seeGrandfather (disambiguation),Grandmother (disambiguation),Grandma (disambiguation),Grandpa (disambiguation),Granddad (disambiguation),Gramps or Gramp,AbuelaandGrandaddy.The Favorite– Grandfather and Grandson, byGeorgios Jakobides(1890)Grandparents, individually known asgrandmotherandgrandfather, are theparentsof a person'sfatherormother–paternalormaternal.  Every sexually-reproducing living organism who is not agenetic chimerahas a maximum of fourgeneticgrandparents, eight genetic great-grandparents, sixteen genetic great-great-grandparents, thirty-two genetic great-great-great-grandparents, sixty-four genetic great-great-great-great grandparents, etc.  In the history of modern humanity, around 30,000 years ago, the number of modern humans who lived to be a grandparent increased.[citation needed]It is not known for certain what spurred this increase in longevity,[1]but it is generally believed that a key consequence of threegenerationsbeing alive together was the preservation of information which could otherwise have been lost; an example of this important information might have been where to find water in times of drought.[2][3]In cases where parents are unwilling or unable to provide adequate care for their children (e.g., financial obstacles, marriage problems, illness or death[4]), grandparents often take on the role ofprimary caregivers. Even when this is not the case, and particularly intraditional cultures, grandparents often have a direct and clear role in relation to theraising, care and nurture of children. Grandparents aresecond-degree relativesto their grandchildren and share 25% genetic overlap.A step-grandparent can be the step-parent of the parent or the step-parent's parent or the step-parent's step-parent (though technically this might be called a step-step-grandparent). The various words for grandparents at times may also be used to refer to any elderly person, especially the termsgramps,granny,grandfather,granddad,grandmother,nan,maw-maw,paw-paw(and others which families make up themselves).Titles[edit]A grandfather holding his grandson.When used as a noun (e.g., "... a grandparent walked by"), grandfather and grandmother are usually used, although forms such as grandma/grandpa, granny/granddaddy or even nan/pop are sometimes used. When preceded by "my ..." (e.g., "... my grandpa walked by"), all forms are common (anywhere from "... my grandfather ..." to "... my Gramps ..."). All forms can be used in plural, but Gramps (pluralGramps) is rare.In writing,GrandfatherandGrandmotherare most common, but very rare as a form of address. In speech,GrandpaandGrandmaare commonly used in theUnited States,Canada, andAustralia. InBritain,Ireland,United States,Australia,New Zealandand, particularly prevalent in the Canadian province ofNewfoundland and Labrador,Nan,Nana,Nanna,Nanny,GranandGrannyand other variations are often used for grandmother in both writing and speech.InBangladesh,Pakistan, and many parts ofIndia, maternal grandparents are calledNanaandNani. Similarly, paternal grandparents are calledDadaandDadi. One's parents' maternal grandparents are calledPar-naniandPar-nana. On similar lines, parents' paternal grandparents are calledPar-dadiandPar-dada.A grandmother taking a nutrition class with her grandson.Numerous other variants exist, such asGramp,Gramps,Grampa,Grandpap,Granda,Grampy,Granddad,Granddaddy,Grandpappy,Pop(s),Pap,Papa,Pappy, andPawpawfor grandfather;Grandmom,Grandmama,Grama,Granny,Gran,Nanny,Nan(a),Mammaw, MeemawandGrammyfor grandmother.Gogocan be used for either, etc.Given that people may have two living sets of grandparents, some confusion arises from calling two people "grandma" or "grandpa", so often two of the other terms listed above are used for one set of grandparents. Another common solution is to call grandparents by their first names ("Grandpa George", "Grandma Anne", etc.) or by their family names ("Grandpa Jones", "Grandma Smith"). In North America, many families call one set of grandparents by their ethnic names (e.g.,Hispanicgrandparents might be calledabueloandabuelaor "abuelito" and "abuelita",Frenchgrandparents might be calledpapiandmamie,Italiangrandparents might be callednonnoandnonna, orDutchandGermangrandparents might be calledOpaandOma. InFlanderspepee or petje and memee or metje are most used). InFriesland, a common pair is pake and beppe.Mandarin-speakingChinesepeople refer to maternal grandparents aswài pó(外婆, mother's mother) andwài gōng(外公, mother's father) and paternal grandparents asnǎi nai(奶奶, father's mother) andyé yé(爷爷, father's father). In thePhilippines, grandparents are calledlolo(grandfather) andlola(grandmother).Languages and cultures with more specifickinship terminologythan English may distinguish between paternal grandparents and maternal grandparents. For example, in theSwedish languagethere is no single word for "grandmother"; the mother's mother is termedmormorand the father's mother is termedfarmor.[5]However, the otherScandinavian languages,DanishandNorwegian, use words which specifies the kinship like in Swedish (identically spelled among all three languages), as well as using common terms similar to grandmother (Danish: bedstemor, Norwegian: bestemor).Great-grandparents and beyond[edit]TimuridconquerorBaburseeks the advice of his grandmother.The parents of a grandparent, or the grandparents of a parent, are called the same names as grandparents (grandfather/-mother, grandpa/-ma, granddad/-ma, etc.) with the prefixgreat-added, with an additionalgreat-added for each additional generation. One's great-grandparent's parents would be "great-great-grandparents".To avoid a proliferation of "greats" when discussing genealogical trees, one may also useordinalsinstead of multiple "greats"; thus a "great-great-grandfather" would be the "second great-grandfather", and a "great-great-great-grandfather" would be a third great-grandfather, and so on. This system is used by some genealogical websites such asGeni.[6]One may also usecardinal numbersfor numbering greats, for example, great-great-great-grandmother becomes 3×-great-grandmother.Individuals who share the same great-grandparents but are not siblings orfirst cousinsare "second cousins" to each other, as second cousins have grandparents who are siblings. Similarly, "third cousins" would have great-grandparents who are siblings, and "fourth cousins" would have great-great-grandparents who are siblings.Etymology[edit]Kurdishfamily inBisaran,IranThe use of the prefix "grand-" dates from the early 13th century, from theAnglo-Frenchgraund. The term was used as a translation ofLatinmagnus.[7]The prefix"great-"represents a direct translation of Anglo-Frenchgraundand Latinmagnusto English.[8]InOld English, the prefixesealde-(old) andieldra-(elder) were used (ealdefæder/-mōdorandieldrafæder/-mōdor). A great-grandfather was called aþridda fæder(third father), a great-great-grandfather afēowerða fæder(fourth father), etc.Variation[edit]maternal grandmother- mother's mother.maternal grandfather- mother's father.paternal grandmother- father's mother.paternal grandfather- father's father.Involvement in childcare[edit]A grandfather teaching his granddaughter to use akick scooterA grandmother playing with her grandsonGrandparents are changing their roles in contemporary world,[9]especially as they are becoming increasingly involved in childcare. According to a 2012 study based on 2010 census and survey data, around 10% of children in the U.S. live in a household including a grandparent.[10]Of these, approximately a third live in a household consisting of two parents and a grandparent.[10]Likewise, more than 40% of grandparents across 11 European countries care for their grandchildren in the absence of the parents.[11]In Britain, around 63% of grandparents care for their grandchildren who are under 16 years old.[11]Grandparent involvement is also common in Eastern societies. For instance, 48% of grandparents in Hong Kong reported that they are taking care of their grandchildren.[12]In China, around 58% of Chinese grandparents who are aged 45 or older are involved in childcare.[13]In Singapore, 40% of children from birth to three years old are cared by their grandparents and this percentage is still increasing.[14]In South Korea, 53% of children under the age of 6 years old are cared by their grandparents.[15]Therefore, grandparents taking care of their grandchildren has become a prevalent phenomenon around the world.There are a few reasons why grandparent involvement is becoming more prevalent. First, life expectancy has increased while fertility rates have decreased. This means that more children are growing up while their grandparents are still alive and able to become involved in childcare.[10]In addition, the reduced fertility rates mean that grandparents can devote more attention and resources to their only grandchildren.[16]Second, more mothers are involved in the workforce, and thus, other caregivers need to be present to care for the child.[10]For instance, in Hong Kong, 55% of grandparents reported that they took care of their grandchild because his or her parents have to work.[12]In South Korea, 53% of working mother reported that they once received child care services from their parents.[15]Third, the increasing number of single-parent families creates a need for grandparental support.[17]The degree of grandparent involvement also varies depending on the societal context, such as the social welfare policies. For example, in European countries such as Sweden and Denmark, where formal childcare is widely available, grandparents provide less intensive childcare.[11]By contrast, in European countries such as Spain and Italy, where formal childcare is limited, and welfare payment is low, grandparents provide more intensive childcare.[11]In Singapore, the grandparent caregiver tax relief was established in 2004, which enables working parents (Singapore citizens with children age 12 and below) whose children are being cared for by unemployed grandparents to receive income tax relief of 3,000 Singaporean dollars.[14]Types[edit]There are different types of grandparental involvement, including nonresident grandparents, co-resident grandparents, grandparent-maintained household, and custodial grandparents.[18][19]Nonresident grandparents: Grandparents who do not live with their grandchildren, but provide care for them,[18][19]such as picking them up from school.Co-resident grandparents: Grandparents who live with their grandchild, as well as their parents. This type of household is also known as three-generational households.[18]According to a report that uses data from the 2010 Census, the American Community Survey (ACS), the Current Population Survey (CPS), and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), co-resident grandparents are more likely to be in poverty and suffer from an illness or disability.[10]Grandparent-maintained households: A grandparent who is in charge of the household. In this type of household, the parents may or may not be present.[10]In the US, 33% of children who live in a grandparent-maintained household have only the grandparents present; this is comparable to another 30% who live with a grandmother and one or more parents.[10]Custodial grandparents: Grandparents who raise their grandchildren without the presence of the grandchildren's parents in the household. This type of involvement is especially common among ethnic minority groups.[20]For instance, approximately 50% of custodial grandparents in the USA belong to an ethnic minority group.[21]In general, grandparents adopt the primary caregiving role for various reasons, such as when the parents have died, been imprisoned, been deployed by the military, or lost custody of their children due to neglect or abuse.[18][19]Impact[edit]On grandchildren[edit]Grandparents have different functions in child development. Not only do they provide instrumental support such as picking grandchildren up from school or feeding them, but they also offer emotional support.[22]Furthermore, grandparents protect children from being impacted by negative circumstances, such as harsh parenting, poor economic status, and single-parent families.[23][24]In addition to providing support, grandparents can also help grandchildren with their schoolwork or teach them values that are integral to their society.[22]Grandparents can have a positive or negative impact on child development. On the one hand, previous research suggests that children and adolescents who have a close relationship with their grandparents tend to have better well-being, experience fewer emotional problems, and demonstrate fewer problematic behaviours.[23][24]They are also more academically engaged and are more likely to help others.[25]On the other hand, there are also research studies indicating that grandparent involvement is associated with more hyperactivity and peer difficulties among young children.[26]In other words, children who are cared for by their grandparents can have more interpersonal relationship problems.[26]Also, children who are under the care of their grandparents have poorer health outcomes such as obesity, and more injuries due to low safety awareness.[27]On grandparents[edit]EmperorPedro II of Brazilwith his consortTeresa Cristinaand their grandsonPrince Pedro Augusto, 1887. The Emperor's favorite grandson, he was known as "the Preferred".[28]Since taking care of grandchildren could be a highly demanding job that requires constant energy and time devotion,[29]grandparental involvement in child raising could have a negative impact on grandparents’ physical and emotional health. For example, taking care of grandchildren can reduce grandparents’ own time for self-care such as missing their medical appointments. Therefore, they are likely to have a higher chance to suffer from physical health issues.[30]In the US, compared with those who do not take care of their grandchildren, grandparents who are involved in childcare are more likely to have poor physical conditions, such as heart disease, hypertension or body pain.[31]Besides physical health issues, grandparents are also likely to have emotional issues. To be more specific, raising young children again could be a stressful and overwhelming experience and thus results in different kinds of negative emotions such as anxiety or depression.[32]In addition to physical and emotional issues, grandparents who are involved in caring for their grandchildren can also suffer socially. For instance, grandparents will be forced to limit their social activities so as to care for their grandchildren. By doing so, grandparents become more isolated from their social relations.[33]Taking care of grandchildren also means more responsibilities, grandparents would fear for their grandchildren's future well-being because of their disability and death in the future.[34]If grandparents cannot handle the caregiver role of their grandchildren well, this job can eventually become a burden or stressor and bring more severe physical health and emotional issues to grandparents.[35]However, there are also positive effects of being involved in grandchildren raising. Compared with grandparents who do not provide caregiving to their grandchildren, those who take care of their grandchildren with long hours are more likely to have better cognitive functions.[36]To be more specific, taking care of grandchildren helps elder grandparents maintain their mental capacities in later life, they are also less likely to develop diseases such as dementia.[37]Moreover, frequent interactions with their grandchildren could reduce the cognitive aging process, allowing grandparents a chance to live a more vibrant and active life.[18][36]Grandparents also get benefits of physically exercising more during this process.[38]Taking care of grandchildren can also have benefits on grandparents’ emotional health. As an example, many grandparents start to feel a sense of purpose and meaning in life again after their retirement; as another example, their ties with their adult children and grandchildren are also strengthened.[39]Many grandparents also think of the caregiving experience as positive because it provides another chance for them to make up mistakes they made with their own children and give them more opportunities to educate their grandchildren and improve their parenting styles.[40]Cultural comparisons[edit]Grandmother and her granddaughterGrandparental involvement differs between Western and Eastern cultures. Grandparents taking care of their grandchildren is a common phenomenon in China due to Chinese traditions which emphasize family harmony, collective well-being, intergenerational exchanges and filial responsibilities.[35]China's unique philosophies,BuddhismandTaoism, play important roles in forming these cultural values. While Chinese Buddhism emphasizes prioritized role of the family in Chinese society and harmonious relations among family members,[41]Taoism emphasizes the importance of harmony in interpersonal relations and relations between nature and the humans.[42]These philosophies underline the important role that families play in Chinese cultures. Besides cultural factors, grandparents taking care of their grandchildren also appears in the context in which their adult children need to work full-time, and the child care services are either too expensive (in big cities) or too scarce (in remote areas).[35][43]Grandparents serving as their grandchildren's caregiver is particularly common in rural China. Due to the fast development ofurbanization in Chinasince the 1980s, up to 220 million migrant workers from rural areas move to urban areas to seek for more job opportunities, which leave around 58 million children behind in rural areas,[43]grandparents, therefore, undertake the role of parents and become caregivers to their grandchildren. A new population named “left-behind grandparents”[44]appears in this context, these grandparents live in rural China, and their main job is to look after their grandchildren, most of these grandparents are facing financial burdens and wish their adult children could come back. The mental and physical health of “left-behind grandparents” needs more attention from the public.[45]Even though in urban areas where child care services are available, nearly all grandparents still prefer to take care of their grandchildren voluntarily. Not only because this can reduce their adult children's financial burdens on child care services but also taking care of their own grandchildren is a more effective way to maintain family harmony.[35]In the US, taking care of grandchildren is not a necessary responsibility of grandparents. Grandparents taking care of their grandchildren is often caused by involuntary events or crisis, and it is more like a solution to a problem, not an initiative desire, which is a distinct difference from that in China.[34]For example, grandparents in the USA often take care of their grandchildren when their adult children get into troubles such as substance abuse, incarceration or parental death.[34][46]Differences also exist in different ethnicities in the US.  Caucasian individuals generally regard individual independence as more important, so grandparents are less likely to take care of their grandchildren. However, African American and Latino individuals are more likely to regard looking after grandchildren as a family tradition and are more willing to provide help for their adult children.[47]Ethnic differences in grandparents looking after their grandchildren reflect different cultural values that different ethnic groups hold. To be more specific, African American grandparents are more likely to provide guidance and discipline to their grandchildren due to their flexible family system in which relatives, nonblood kin are all willing to help each other.[48]Latino families have a strong preference to live together and keep frequent contact with family members because most of them are immigrants or first-generation born in the US, they are more likely to live and function as a unit. Grandparents in Latino culture also play important roles in stabilizing the family unit as family leaders.[49]Although Caucasian grandparents are less likely to raise their grandchildren,[50]they have more cognitive or physical burdens of taking care of grandchildren compared with other ethnic groups,[51]mainly because their caregiver roles are less normative, and they rely more on remote or companionate parenting styles. On the contrary, African American and Latino grandparents rely more on disciplinary and instructional parenting styles and they are less likely to have cognitive or physical burdens when taking care of their grandchildren.[52]See also[edit]AuntCousinGrandfamilyGrandfather clauseGrandfather ruleMiddle ageMidlife crisisNational Grandparents DayUncleReferences[edit]^Zhavoronkov, Alex (2013-07-02)."13 Reasons Why We Will Live Longer Than Our Parents".Huffington Post.

Please show the world that you're as smart as we think you are".

At least, that's been the excuse, although judging by the finished product, it was the script that never lived up to the promise of its premise."[97]Later that year, Smith had his second starring role in an animated film, inSpies in Disguise, oppositeTom Holland.

Educational methodologies used by the school includeStudy Technology,Montessori education,Gardner, andBrunermethods.The school closed on June 28, 2013.[1]Funding[edit]The school's campus was formerly used byIndian Hills High School,[2]which relocated toAgoura High SchoolinAgoura Hills, Californiato save money.[3]In 2008, actorWill SmithpaidUS$890,000 to lease the Calabasas campus for three years, restructuring it from a high school to a private elementary school called New Village Academy.[2]The school is located close to Will Smith's home in Calabasas.[4]Prior to New Village Academy, Smith and Pinkett Smith's two children were home-schooled by their mother.[5]The school was founded by the Smiths, who say they are not Scientologists, in 2005 as a home school for their younger children and those of several other families.[6]Smith and his wife installed their current director ofphilanthropy, Jana Babatunde-Bey, as the executive director of the school and Jacqueline Olivier as Head of School.[6]In an appearance onLive with Regis and KellyWill Smith commented on the educational methodologies used by the school: "There are just very powerful educational concepts that we believe in, and we feel like we want to design the system that revolutionizes public education."[7]"New Village Academy was born of a simple question, 'Is it possible to create an educational environment in which children have fun learning?' Jada and I believe the answer is 'Yes.'", said Smith in a released statement.[8][9]A spokesperson for Will Smith toldThe Guardian: "Will is leasing the campus for three years, plus he'll cover all costs such as utilities. The academy will be run privately, and will includepre-kindergartenthrough grade six."[10]New Village Academy's Calabasas facilities opened in 2008.[11][12]In March 2009 theAssociated Pressreported that Jada Pinkett-Smith planned to open a companion high-school.[13]Federal tax filing showed that Will Smith donated $1.2 million to the school in 2010.[14]Teaching and staff[edit]Educational methodologies used by the school includedMontessori,Gardner,Jerome Bruner, andStudy Technology.[6]Subjects included in the school's curriculum includemathematics,literacy,Spanish,karate,yoga,robotics,technology,etiquette,art, and living skills.[6][9]New Village Academy served organic meals to students, and laptops were made available to all students.[5]The school encouraged parental involvement and restricted access to television.[6]Tuition was approximately $22,500 per year to attend the school,[15]and 80% of the students would receive financial assistance.[16]Scientology ties[edit]Tom CruiseandKatie Holmes' daughter Suri attended the school from 2009[17]The staff includes a number ofScientologists, including the Director of Learning, Director of Qualifications and artistic director,[5]as well as some of the school's teachers.[18]New Village Academy's Director of Learning, formerly the director of HELP inBoston, graduated from the ScientologyDelphi SchoolinMilton, Massachusetts.[5]The school's website lists "Study Technology", a form of education developed byChurch of ScientologyfounderL. Ron Hubbard,[19]as one of its methodologies.[5]The website utilizesScientology terminologyincluding "spiraling" and "gradient" in order to illustrate how students learn in the school's programs.[5]The school's motto "Spiral Up" has been compared to Scientology's term "dwindling spiral", when "one commits overt acts unwittingly",[20]although "spiral curriculum" is also a term associated withJerome Bruner.[21]When a student needs to be disciplined they are taken to the "ethics teacher".[10]Jada Pinkett Smith toldABC News, "Study Technology is a secular methodology intended to help students better understand what is being studied and apply it to real life. NVLA integrates this methodology as a tool in instructional design by providing teachers the framework to design lessons and curriculum."[22]In response to reports of Scientology ties in 2008, Jacqueline Olivier who was administrator at the time, denied that the school had a religious affiliation, and told theLos Angeles Times: "People tend to think Study Technology is a subject, but it is really just the way the subject is taught. They then come to the conclusion that we are teaching Scientology when actually a methodology doesn't have anything to do with content."[6]Olivier was appointed administrator at the school in 2007, her duties have included hiring all teachers since that time.[23]She said that in addition to Scientologists the school also hasMuslim,ChristianandJewishstaff members,[6]and said: "We are a secular school."[24]"Faculty and staff do not promote their own religions at school."[25]Children from all religious backgrounds will be accepted at the school.[8]Professor ofcomputer scienceatCarnegie Mellon Universityand Scientology criticDavid S. Touretzkywas critical of the school's use of Study Technology, and told theLos Angeles Times: "There is no reputable educator anywhere who endorsesStudy Technology. What happens is that children are inculcated with Scientology jargon and are led to regard L.R. Hubbard as an authority figure. They are laying the groundwork for later bringing people into Scientology."[6]Touretzky maintains a website critical of Study Technology, and told theLos Angeles Timesthat the terms "Director of Qualifications" and the school's "Qual" department refer to those tested by a Church of Scientology qualifications teacher in a ScientologyAuditingsession.[6]Karin Pouw, Scientology spokeswoman and director of public affairs forChurch of Scientology International,[26]disputed Touretzky's statements and asserted to theLos Angeles Timesthat Study Tech is not a religious methodology and is used in schools internationally.[6]In early September 2008 members of the anti-Scientology groupProject Chanologyprotested outside of New Village Academy and objected to their claims that L. Ron Hubbard techniques were being used in the school.[27]In July 2009, Olivier and several of the teachers resigned from their posts for undisclosed reasons.[28]Olivier was replaced by Piano Foster, an educator with Scientology associations; Foster began at the school on July 1, 2009.[29]Piano Foster has participated in Scientology courses.[30][31]Foster completed the Scientology class, Basic Study Manual, at the Scientology Celebrity Center in 2005.[22]Olivier was let go from herUS$200,000 position, due to disagreements over teaching methodologies to utilize at the school.[32]A representative for Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith told theNew York Post, "Jacquie is no longer at the school for reasons entirely unrelated to curriculum. She is an excellent educator and fully embraced the school's secular and open-minded approach to innovative teaching methodologies."[30]TheNew York Postreported that Olivier left the school due to conflicts with the Smiths over the Scientology "Study Tech" teaching methodologies.[30]Foster confirmed she had been placed as the new administrator for the school, and stated, "I officially took over on July 1, 2009, and I'm looking forward to the challenge. I feel I'm ready for the job."[33]Suri Cruisebegan attending in April 2009.[17]According to the Smiths, the school has no religious affiliation.[34]See also[edit]Greater Los Angeles portalSchools portalDelphi SchoolsGreenfields SchoolMace-Kingsley Ranch SchoolWorld Literacy CrusadeReferences[edit]^Ortega, Tony (July 3, 2013)."Will Smith-Backed School That Used Scientology Materials Closes Its Doors".The Underground Bunker.

What Goes on Inside Will Smith, Jada Pinkett-Smith's School?  - ABC NewsABC NewsVideoLiveShowsGuns in AmericaInterest Successfully AddedWe'll notify you here with news aboutTurn on desktop notifications for breaking stories about interest?OffOnLOG INStream onWhat Goes on Inside Will Smith, Jada Pinkett-Smith's School?Smith, Jada Pinkett-Smith's New Village Leadership Academy stirs curiosity.ByHEATHER DOWNIESeptember 8, 2009, 4:48 PMSept. 11, 2009 &#151; --Like many modern celebrity power couples,Will SmithandJada Pinkett-Smithare not satisfied with just being actors.The couple, who met on the set of "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" in 1995, have had a lot of different roles over the years, most recently founding the New Village Leadership Academy (NVLA), a private elementary school in Calabasas, Calif., which opened its doors this week for the start of the 2009-10 school year.But asOprah Winfreyfamously discovered when she startedThe Leadership Academy School for Girls, for celebrities, getting involved in an educational venture can be a road fraught with controversy.Coupled with the long-time "secretlyScientologist" rumors that have surrounded the Smiths, the school's opening has attracted curiosity.While they're close friends with actorsTom CruiseandKatie Holmes, arguably the world's most famous Scientology couple, Smith has said that he is a not a member of the church."I've talked to Tom about it. [There's] lots of incredible, wonderful concepts [but my wife] Jada and I don't necessarily believe in organized religion. I was raised in a Baptist household, and my grandmother would get up out of her casket [if I became a Scientologist]," Smith told the World Entertainment News Network, a news wire, in 2006.Also creating questions are reports that tax returns for 2008 from the Smith's charitable foundation show that the couple gave a combined $122,500 in donations to groups affiliated with the Church of Scientology.The Smiths reportedly donated a total of $1.3 million to a variety of religious, civic and arts groups that year. Smith's biggest single contribution was to Yesha Ministries of Philadelphia. He gave the Christian-based organization run by the Rev. James Robinson $250,000. Another $200,000 went to a Christian ministry in Los Angeles called "Living Waters." The foundation also donated to a Los Angeles mosque, as well as the Yitzhak Rabin Memorial Center and other religious groups.  When asked about the donations, Will Smith's publicist, Pat Kinsley, told ABC News.com that her client doesn't comment on his philanthropic work.In an interview with Ebony magazine earlier this year, Pinkett-Smith said that the NVLA was not tied to Scientology: "All I can say is it is not a Scientology school," she told the magazine. "Now, If you don't trust me, and you are questioning my integrity, that's a whole different matter. That is straight evil to think that I would bring families into that educational institution and then try to get them to convert into some religion."Despite such statements, skeptics continue to raise questions about whether the Smiths have ties to Scientology, especially when it comes to the NVLA.The suspicions stem largely from the NVLA's use of Study Technology, a teaching methodology developed byL. Ron Hubbard, the founder of theChurch of Scientology.It operates under the assumption that there are three "barriers" to learning that children must identify and overcome.Critics claim Study Technology is repackaged Scientology. One professor who has closely followed Scientology suggested the "three barriers" technique is used as a means of familiarizing children with some of the vocabulary often used in Scientology teachings, and several educators told ABCNews.com that the "three barriers" philosophy is a fundamentally flawed teaching tool.But proponents of the method like the Smiths and Applied Scholastics, the organization founded in 1972 to make Study Tech broadly available, say it's an effective, nonreligious teaching technique."Study Technology is a secular methodology intended to help students better understand what is being studied and apply it to real life," Pinkett-Smith wrote in an e-mail to ABCNews.com forwarded through her publicist. "NVLA integrates this methodology as a tool in instructional design by providing teachers the framework to design lessons and curriculum."In a March interview with National Public Radio, Pinkett-Smith spoke about the school's alleged religious ties."I definitely want to make it very clear to everybody that the educational institution that we have, the school that Will and I have, is not a Scientology school ... it is not a desire of ours to educate children with Scientology, that is not what Will and I want to do.  And our school is not, and I repeat, not a Scientology school."The most ardent critic of Study Technology says he doesn't buy all the denials.  Dave S. Touretzky, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, created a Web site that dissects Study Tech and asserts that it is the Scientology religion disguised as education.Touretzky said he became focused on Scientology after the group threatened to sue Carnegie Mellon and himself after he posted a secret document revealing what he called the organization's "creation myth.""I can't say it [the school] is aScientologychurch," he told ABCNews.com. "What they seem to have is some sort of a hybrid. Scientology repackaged for the Hollywood crowd. It's hitting all the politically correct elements ... but snuck in there is this Scientology stuff."A spokeswoman for the Church ofScientology, Karin Pouw, would not comment on whether there was a relationship between Scientology and the NVLA. She referred all questions back to the school.Other educators worry less about Study Technology's ties to Scientology and more about its overall effectiveness."I look at the Study Tech ideas and it doesn't seem sound educationally," said Jim McManus, executive director of the California Association of Independent Schools.  He spent 14 years as an education consultant for independent schools around the country and says he has no personal animosity toward Scientology.Dan Willingham, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia who has a background as a cognitive scientist and wrote the book "Why Don't Students Like School," has similar doubts about Study Technology's merits and says it is based on flawed theories."It's perfectly possible that the methodology is based on ridiculous principles and that something effective is happening in the classroom, but ridiculous principles certainly lowers that possibility," Willingham said.The New Village Leadership AcademyLocated in the city of Calabasas, just outside of Los Angeles, the New Village Leadership Academy is nestled alongside a main road and surrounded by palm trees and housing developments.The NVLA opened its doors Sept. 3, 2008, after the Smiths paid nearly $1 million to lease the Indian Hills High School campus in the Las Virgines Unified School District for three years.Like many private schools in L.A., NVLA students pay annual tuitions of up to $12,500. In return, says its Web site, students get "a mix of traditional and progressive teaching methodologies." Students take classes in yoga, robotics, etiquette, Spanish and karate, and are fed organic, non-sugary foods.Two of the school's fewer than 100 students are the Smith's previously home-schooled children -- Jaden,10, and Willow, 8.The NVLA's Web site calls the school "an optimum learning environment -- an ideal model to be shared with all people of the world."Not everyone agrees.Project Chanology, an Internet-based anti-Scientology group, protested the school's opening, calling the private academy a "front" for the Church of Scientology and picketed on the sidewalk in front of the school, carrying signs with messages reading, "Study Tech exploits children for profit."While no one from the group responded to e-mails from ABCNews.com, a press release sent Sept. 8, 2008, said their primary concern is that all schools using Study Tech must pay licensing fees to the Church of Scientology: "This revenue stream is one of the many sources of income which the Church of Scientology uses for such tactics as invoking frivolous lawsuits and hiring private investigators to intimidate critics."The release went on to say that Smith met with the organization during the protests and said he was "not a Scientologist," but was "unable to definitively say that NVLA is making no payments to Scientology." He then explained "he does not wish to pay a fee to anyone because of his desire to maintain complete control over the teaching methods used at NVLA, an option not typically offered to licensees of Scientology Technology," according to the release.When asked if NVLA pays a licensing fee for Study Tech to the Church of Scientology, Will Smith's publicist, Pat Kingsley, replied, "no," in an e-mail to ABCNews.comThe Church of Scientology believes Project Chanology has ties to an organization called Anonymous, a group that organizes mostly online protests and has a longstanding opposition to Scientology. The church released a statement earlier in 2008 in anticipation of a Project Chanology protest, alleging that the group had targeted Scientology based on "religious bigotry.""As to our knowledge of the organizers of the event, they are cyberterrorists who hide their identities behind masks and computer anonymity," read the statement, which was posted on the St. Petersburg Times Web site. "'Anonymous'" is perpetrating religious hate crimes against churches of Scientology and individual Scientologists for no reason other than religious bigotry."Scientology dates back to the 1950s, when it was created by Hubbard, a science fiction writer. Hubbard believed people were spiritual beings, or Thetans, whose minds stored mental images beyond a person's control. Through spiritual counseling called "auditing," Hubbard taught that a person could solve personal problems by locating these images and addressing them.Since its founding, Scientology has received its fair share of media criticism and has come under fire for lambasting psychiatry. One of the most memorable examples was Cruise's chastising of actress Brooke Shields for using anti-depressants to treat postpartum depression. Cruise later apologized to Shields for being critical.Citing the controversial aspects of Scientology as troubling, critics have been quick to point out that the NVLA school employs people who have taken Scientology courses.In July, Jacqueline Olivier was removed from her position as head of the pre-kindergarten through grade six school and replaced by Piano Foster, who completed a Scientology basic study manual course at the Scientology Celebrity Center in 2005, according to TruthAboutScientology.com, a database run by Kristi Wachter that tracks Scientology members.Olivier refused to comment on the removal, saying, "As a former head of the school, it's just not one of those things you do. You keep it professional."When asked by ABCNews.com whether she didn't want to be interviewed because she had signed a confidentiality agreement, Olivier responded, "Yes and no." She then declined to discuss her religious affiliations.While the Smiths and their publicists chose not to comment on the reason behind Olivier's firing, a rep for the Smiths told the New York Post's Page Six, "Jacquie is no longer at the school for reasons entirely unrelated to curriculum." The Smith's spokeswoman also described Foster as a Catholic, not a Scientologist.In June 2008, Olivier told the Los Angeles Times, "We are a secular school, and just like all nonreligious independent schools, faculty and staff do not promote their own religions at school or pass on the beliefs of their particular faith to children."  She also said the school would use many philosophies, including Montessori, Bruner and Gardner.NVLA Faculty's Scientology TiesWachter, who started the TruthAboutScientology.com Web site to gauge whether the number ofScientologistswas growing, says she gets her data from three Scientology magazines -- Freewinds, Celebrity and Auditor, which Wachter collects from former Scientology members.  All three publish Scientology course completion data.According to Wachter's Web site, the NVLA's artistic director, Sisu Raiken, and director of learning, Tasia Jones, have also taken Scientology courses.  Wachter says Raiken enrolled in 16 courses and Jones completed six between 2000 and 2006.Raiken and Jones also appear to host Web sites through the Church of Scientology.  The banners on these sites read: "I am a Scientologist, Support Religious Tolerance."Raiken's page says: "I have studied many courses inScientologyover the past 16 years, done the Purification Rundown to rid my body of toxins and drugs, and also been involved in many of the social outreach programs of Scientology, mainly getting Mr. Hubbard's literacy program known and put into use."Jones' site says: "I am currently teaching in a small private school" and included a link to the Applied Scholastics Web site.The Scientology Celebrity Center in Hollywood where Foster, Raiken and Jones reportedly took courses said it was not their policy to reveal personal information, and Raiken and Jones did not respond to phone calls asking for comment.By far, the most controversial aspect of the NVLA is its use of the Study Technology teaching methodology."People tend to think Study Technology is a subject, but it is really just the way the subject is taught. They then come to the conclusion that we are teaching Scientology when actually a methodology doesn't have anything to do with content," Olivier told the Los Angeles Times.The three barriers to learning are outlined in five textbooks for kids: Basic Study Manual, Study Skills for Life, Learning How to Learn, How to Use a Dictionary and Grammar and Communication for Children.The first barrier is called a "lack of mass," which means students need to gain hands-on experience to understand a concept.  "Lacking the object associated with a word can inhibit all understanding," explains the Applied Scholastics Web site.The second barrier is a concept called "too steep a gradient," requiring that students master a subject matter before moving on to more advanced concepts.The third is called "misunderstood words," in which students are taught to go back to look up words in a dictionary if they do not understand a concept.  "Stupidity is the effect of misunderstood words," according to ScientologyHandbook.org.The process of looking up misunderstood words is called "word clearing," a six-step procedure that begins with looking up the word in a dictionary and using each of its definitions in several example sentences.The three barriers to learning are accompanied by physiological responses, according to Study Technology.  A student who has skipped a gradient may feel a sort of confusion or a feeling of reeling, such as moving or swaying like you might fall, according to the Applied Scholastics Web site.  The books Learning How to Learn and the Basic Study Manual teach that misunderstood words cause symptoms like feeling blank, tired, worried, upset, "like you are not there", or suffering "a sort of nervous hysteria."Touretzky warned that by teaching kids words like "mass," "clear" and "gradients" that are scattered throughout Church of Scientology literature, the implementation of Study Tech is a way of slipping in Scientology through the back door."Study Tech is one of several paths the church pursues to insinuate Scientology into civilized society," he said.According to the Applied Scholastics Web site, Study Technology has reached 28 million children at 650 centers and schools in more than 65 countries.Eight of those students attended Prescott Middle School in Baton Rouge, La.,  During the 2005-2006 school year, Study Tech was used to "salvage a group of 8th grade students, who might not otherwise be qualified to enter high school at the end of the school year," according to the Web site.All eight passed the Louisiana Education Assessment Program standardized exam and entered 9th grade, according to Diola Bagayoko, a professor of physics at Southern University who partnered with Prescott to develop the school's curriculum, which included Study Tech.He said the use of Study Tech was a last ditch effort before Prescott was taken over for failing to perform.  He said he thoroughly investigated Study Tech before it was implemented and was pleased with the results.He told ABCNews.com that the methodology is "very effective" and based on sound principles.Bagayoko, who is not a Scientologist, said Scientology was never mentioned during the two years it was administered at Prescott.  "There was not a single occurrence of Scientology ever being pushed.  I'm emphatic about it."  He said the kids didn't even know who L. Ron Hubbard was.He admitted, however, that the program ended after two years because of negative media attention focused on the ties between Study Tech and Scientology."I should note that most teachers belong to a religion, and most textbooks and educational policies are developed by individuals who belong to a religion," Bagayoko said.Study Technology as a Teaching ToolWhile the educators ABCNews.com reached  were not familiar with the ties between Study Technology and Scientology, they believe the methodology's barrier theories are flawed."Lack of mass doesn't make very much sense at all," said Willingham. "It seems to imply it's almost impossible to learn anything by reading or by listening, when obviously that's most of what we do."He added that the data on "manipulables" is much more mixed than people think. "People think kids need to have concrete objects to manipulate.  It's more complicated than that.  Sometimes it helps and sometimes it hinders learning to have concrete physical objects."McManus takes issue with the second barrier -- too steep a gradient.  "The whole thing with gradients suggests that there is only one sequential pattern that any kid can use to learn something," he said. "Some kids will move from point G to point M, then get to Z.  Some will skip the whole notion that there is only one sequence of thinking.  Almost anyone that has spent any time in the classroom knows it just doesn't ring true."Stephen A. Kent, a professor of sociology and religious studies at the University of Alberta who has spoken out against Scientology in the past, finds flaws with the way Study Technology handles learning disabilities."Scientology believes that these three techniques can overcome students' learning problems. The program excludes, however, any appreciation of medical or biochemical issues within children which may cause or contribute to learning disabilities."Kent said Scientologists believe these techniques can overcome dyslexia, for instance, but don't advocate kids taking Ritalin and other learning disability drugs for other conditions.Applied Scholastics did not respond to an ABCNews.com request for comment, but the organization's Web site features several stories championing children learning without the use of drugs.The Web site offered other claims about the technique's effectiveness:"In Los Angeles, Calif., students at a school which uses Study Technology throughout its curriculum regularly score 30 percent above the national average on pre-college aptitude tests," according to the Applied Scholastic Web site. "Their 4th grade students consistently score to more grade levels above the norm in reading, math and language on standardized achievement tests."When asked for specific information about successes from the use of Study Technology, a spokesperson wrote in an e-mail that questions could be answered on the Web site.Willingham says he is a man who appreciates data.  "Unless I'm missing something, there is almost no info here [on the Web site] at all to tell you how these studies were actually done.  Those are the details that actually matter."On his Web site, Touretzky writes that Study Tech's promoters are "remarkably vague about its results.  Applied Scholastics and its related organizations have publicized some claimed successes, but have provided no specifics, corroboration or even details of where the results were obtained."He believes schools that use Study Tech are trying to putting a positive face on L. Ron Hubbard's teachings.ABCNews.com was unable to reach students at NVLA, or their parents."I definitely want to make it very clear to everybody that the educational institution that we have, the school that Will and I have, is not a Scientology school," Pinkett-Smith told NPR. "I know there's been ... a lot of buzz around that idea and that it is not my desire to ... teach Scientology at all."I definitely respect and understand people's curiosity, you know, and well, people, they have to trust me when I speak on my truth.

Touretzky, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, created a Web site that dissects Study Tech and asserts that it is the Scientology religion disguised as education.Touretzky said he became focused on Scientology after the group threatened to sue Carnegie Mellon and himself after he posted a secret document revealing what he called the organization's "creation myth.""I can't say it [the school] is aScientologychurch," he told ABCNews.com. "What they seem to have is some sort of a hybrid. Scientology repackaged for the Hollywood crowd. It's hitting all the politically correct elements ... but snuck in there is this Scientology stuff."A spokeswoman for the Church ofScientology, Karin Pouw, would not comment on whether there was a relationship between Scientology and the NVLA. She referred all questions back to the school.Other educators worry less about Study Technology's ties to Scientology and more about its overall effectiveness."I look at the Study Tech ideas and it doesn't seem sound educationally," said Jim McManus, executive director of the California Association of Independent Schools.  He spent 14 years as an education consultant for independent schools around the country and says he has no personal animosity toward Scientology.Dan Willingham, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia who has a background as a cognitive scientist and wrote the book "Why Don't Students Like School," has similar doubts about Study Technology's merits and says it is based on flawed theories."It's perfectly possible that the methodology is based on ridiculous principles and that something effective is happening in the classroom, but ridiculous principles certainly lowers that possibility," Willingham said.The New Village Leadership AcademyLocated in the city of Calabasas, just outside of Los Angeles, the New Village Leadership Academy is nestled alongside a main road and surrounded by palm trees and housing developments.The NVLA opened its doors Sept. 3, 2008, after the Smiths paid nearly $1 million to lease the Indian Hills High School campus in the Las Virgines Unified School District for three years.Like many private schools in L.A., NVLA students pay annual tuitions of up to $12,500. In return, says its Web site, students get "a mix of traditional and progressive teaching methodologies." Students take classes in yoga, robotics, etiquette, Spanish and karate, and are fed organic, non-sugary foods.Two of the school's fewer than 100 students are the Smith's previously home-schooled children -- Jaden,10, and Willow, 8.The NVLA's Web site calls the school "an optimum learning environment -- an ideal model to be shared with all people of the world."Not everyone agrees.Project Chanology, an Internet-based anti-Scientology group, protested the school's opening, calling the private academy a "front" for the Church of Scientology and picketed on the sidewalk in front of the school, carrying signs with messages reading, "Study Tech exploits children for profit."While no one from the group responded to e-mails from ABCNews.com, a press release sent Sept. 8, 2008, said their primary concern is that all schools using Study Tech must pay licensing fees to the Church of Scientology: "This revenue stream is one of the many sources of income which the Church of Scientology uses for such tactics as invoking frivolous lawsuits and hiring private investigators to intimidate critics."The release went on to say that Smith met with the organization during the protests and said he was "not a Scientologist," but was "unable to definitively say that NVLA is making no payments to Scientology." He then explained "he does not wish to pay a fee to anyone because of his desire to maintain complete control over the teaching methods used at NVLA, an option not typically offered to licensees of Scientology Technology," according to the release.When asked if NVLA pays a licensing fee for Study Tech to the Church of Scientology, Will Smith's publicist, Pat Kingsley, replied, "no," in an e-mail to ABCNews.comThe Church of Scientology believes Project Chanology has ties to an organization called Anonymous, a group that organizes mostly online protests and has a longstanding opposition to Scientology. The church released a statement earlier in 2008 in anticipation of a Project Chanology protest, alleging that the group had targeted Scientology based on "religious bigotry.""As to our knowledge of the organizers of the event, they are cyberterrorists who hide their identities behind masks and computer anonymity," read the statement, which was posted on the St. Petersburg Times Web site. "'Anonymous'" is perpetrating religious hate crimes against churches of Scientology and individual Scientologists for no reason other than religious bigotry."Scientology dates back to the 1950s, when it was created by Hubbard, a science fiction writer. Hubbard believed people were spiritual beings, or Thetans, whose minds stored mental images beyond a person's control. Through spiritual counseling called "auditing," Hubbard taught that a person could solve personal problems by locating these images and addressing them.Since its founding, Scientology has received its fair share of media criticism and has come under fire for lambasting psychiatry. One of the most memorable examples was Cruise's chastising of actress Brooke Shields for using anti-depressants to treat postpartum depression. Cruise later apologized to Shields for being critical.Citing the controversial aspects of Scientology as troubling, critics have been quick to point out that the NVLA school employs people who have taken Scientology courses.In July, Jacqueline Olivier was removed from her position as head of the pre-kindergarten through grade six school and replaced by Piano Foster, who completed a Scientology basic study manual course at the Scientology Celebrity Center in 2005, according to TruthAboutScientology.com, a database run by Kristi Wachter that tracks Scientology members.Olivier refused to comment on the removal, saying, "As a former head of the school, it's just not one of those things you do. You keep it professional."When asked by ABCNews.com whether she didn't want to be interviewed because she had signed a confidentiality agreement, Olivier responded, "Yes and no." She then declined to discuss her religious affiliations.While the Smiths and their publicists chose not to comment on the reason behind Olivier's firing, a rep for the Smiths told the New York Post's Page Six, "Jacquie is no longer at the school for reasons entirely unrelated to curriculum." The Smith's spokeswoman also described Foster as a Catholic, not a Scientologist.In June 2008, Olivier told the Los Angeles Times, "We are a secular school, and just like all nonreligious independent schools, faculty and staff do not promote their own religions at school or pass on the beliefs of their particular faith to children."  She also said the school would use many philosophies, including Montessori, Bruner and Gardner.NVLA Faculty's Scientology TiesWachter, who started the TruthAboutScientology.com Web site to gauge whether the number ofScientologistswas growing, says she gets her data from three Scientology magazines -- Freewinds, Celebrity and Auditor, which Wachter collects from former Scientology members.  All three publish Scientology course completion data.According to Wachter's Web site, the NVLA's artistic director, Sisu Raiken, and director of learning, Tasia Jones, have also taken Scientology courses.  Wachter says Raiken enrolled in 16 courses and Jones completed six between 2000 and 2006.Raiken and Jones also appear to host Web sites through the Church of Scientology.  The banners on these sites read: "I am a Scientologist, Support Religious Tolerance."Raiken's page says: "I have studied many courses inScientologyover the past 16 years, done the Purification Rundown to rid my body of toxins and drugs, and also been involved in many of the social outreach programs of Scientology, mainly getting Mr. Hubbard's literacy program known and put into use."Jones' site says: "I am currently teaching in a small private school" and included a link to the Applied Scholastics Web site.The Scientology Celebrity Center in Hollywood where Foster, Raiken and Jones reportedly took courses said it was not their policy to reveal personal information, and Raiken and Jones did not respond to phone calls asking for comment.By far, the most controversial aspect of the NVLA is its use of the Study Technology teaching methodology."People tend to think Study Technology is a subject, but it is really just the way the subject is taught. They then come to the conclusion that we are teaching Scientology when actually a methodology doesn't have anything to do with content," Olivier told the Los Angeles Times.The three barriers to learning are outlined in five textbooks for kids: Basic Study Manual, Study Skills for Life, Learning How to Learn, How to Use a Dictionary and Grammar and Communication for Children.The first barrier is called a "lack of mass," which means students need to gain hands-on experience to understand a concept.  "Lacking the object associated with a word can inhibit all understanding," explains the Applied Scholastics Web site.The second barrier is a concept called "too steep a gradient," requiring that students master a subject matter before moving on to more advanced concepts.The third is called "misunderstood words," in which students are taught to go back to look up words in a dictionary if they do not understand a concept.  "Stupidity is the effect of misunderstood words," according to ScientologyHandbook.org.The process of looking up misunderstood words is called "word clearing," a six-step procedure that begins with looking up the word in a dictionary and using each of its definitions in several example sentences.The three barriers to learning are accompanied by physiological responses, according to Study Technology.  A student who has skipped a gradient may feel a sort of confusion or a feeling of reeling, such as moving or swaying like you might fall, according to the Applied Scholastics Web site.  The books Learning How to Learn and the Basic Study Manual teach that misunderstood words cause symptoms like feeling blank, tired, worried, upset, "like you are not there", or suffering "a sort of nervous hysteria."Touretzky warned that by teaching kids words like "mass," "clear" and "gradients" that are scattered throughout Church of Scientology literature, the implementation of Study Tech is a way of slipping in Scientology through the back door."Study Tech is one of several paths the church pursues to insinuate Scientology into civilized society," he said.According to the Applied Scholastics Web site, Study Technology has reached 28 million children at 650 centers and schools in more than 65 countries.Eight of those students attended Prescott Middle School in Baton Rouge, La.,  During the 2005-2006 school year, Study Tech was used to "salvage a group of 8th grade students, who might not otherwise be qualified to enter high school at the end of the school year," according to the Web site.All eight passed the Louisiana Education Assessment Program standardized exam and entered 9th grade, according to Diola Bagayoko, a professor of physics at Southern University who partnered with Prescott to develop the school's curriculum, which included Study Tech.He said the use of Study Tech was a last ditch effort before Prescott was taken over for failing to perform.  He said he thoroughly investigated Study Tech before it was implemented and was pleased with the results.He told ABCNews.com that the methodology is "very effective" and based on sound principles.Bagayoko, who is not a Scientologist, said Scientology was never mentioned during the two years it was administered at Prescott.  "There was not a single occurrence of Scientology ever being pushed.  I'm emphatic about it."  He said the kids didn't even know who L. Ron Hubbard was.He admitted, however, that the program ended after two years because of negative media attention focused on the ties between Study Tech and Scientology."I should note that most teachers belong to a religion, and most textbooks and educational policies are developed by individuals who belong to a religion," Bagayoko said.Study Technology as a Teaching ToolWhile the educators ABCNews.com reached  were not familiar with the ties between Study Technology and Scientology, they believe the methodology's barrier theories are flawed."Lack of mass doesn't make very much sense at all," said Willingham. "It seems to imply it's almost impossible to learn anything by reading or by listening, when obviously that's most of what we do."He added that the data on "manipulables" is much more mixed than people think. "People think kids need to have concrete objects to manipulate.  It's more complicated than that.  Sometimes it helps and sometimes it hinders learning to have concrete physical objects."McManus takes issue with the second barrier -- too steep a gradient.  "The whole thing with gradients suggests that there is only one sequential pattern that any kid can use to learn something," he said. "Some kids will move from point G to point M, then get to Z.  Some will skip the whole notion that there is only one sequence of thinking.  Almost anyone that has spent any time in the classroom knows it just doesn't ring true."Stephen A. Kent, a professor of sociology and religious studies at the University of Alberta who has spoken out against Scientology in the past, finds flaws with the way Study Technology handles learning disabilities."Scientology believes that these three techniques can overcome students' learning problems. The program excludes, however, any appreciation of medical or biochemical issues within children which may cause or contribute to learning disabilities."Kent said Scientologists believe these techniques can overcome dyslexia, for instance, but don't advocate kids taking Ritalin and other learning disability drugs for other conditions.Applied Scholastics did not respond to an ABCNews.com request for comment, but the organization's Web site features several stories championing children learning without the use of drugs.The Web site offered other claims about the technique's effectiveness:"In Los Angeles, Calif., students at a school which uses Study Technology throughout its curriculum regularly score 30 percent above the national average on pre-college aptitude tests," according to the Applied Scholastic Web site. "Their 4th grade students consistently score to more grade levels above the norm in reading, math and language on standardized achievement tests."When asked for specific information about successes from the use of Study Technology, a spokesperson wrote in an e-mail that questions could be answered on the Web site.Willingham says he is a man who appreciates data.  "Unless I'm missing something, there is almost no info here [on the Web site] at all to tell you how these studies were actually done.  Those are the details that actually matter."On his Web site, Touretzky writes that Study Tech's promoters are "remarkably vague about its results.  Applied Scholastics and its related organizations have publicized some claimed successes, but have provided no specifics, corroboration or even details of where the results were obtained."He believes schools that use Study Tech are trying to putting a positive face on L. Ron Hubbard's teachings.ABCNews.com was unable to reach students at NVLA, or their parents."I definitely want to make it very clear to everybody that the educational institution that we have, the school that Will and I have, is not a Scientology school," Pinkett-Smith told NPR. "I know there's been ... a lot of buzz around that idea and that it is not my desire to ... teach Scientology at all."I definitely respect and understand people's curiosity, you know, and well, people, they have to trust me when I speak on my truth.  That's really the bottom line."Top StoriesMost leading Republicans remain quiet on abortion pill ruling as Dems blast decisionApr 11, 3:04 PMLouisville shooting updates: Dramatic body camera footage released33 minutes agoChina 'ready to fight' after 3 days of large-scale military drills around TaiwanApr 11, 10:23 AMJudge, Fox attorney clash over TV hosts' testimony in Dominion defamation caseApr 11, 2:11 PMOver 2,000 residents ordered to evacuate after fire ignites at recycling plantApr 11, 8:09 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact UsCopyright Â©2023ABC News Internet Ventures.

  <p>​​The Phoenix Street Transportation Department unveiled signage on Tuesday that designates Fillmore Street between Central Avenue and 7th Street as the Hans Hughes Memorial Bikeway. The family of the late Hughes joined Mayor Kate Gallego, Vice Mayor and District 7 Councilwoman Yassamin Ansari, representatives from Downtown Phoenix Inc. (DPI) and city staff to celebrate the occasion.<br></p>
  <p>The blue signs with white lettering are located along Fillmore Street facing east and west, and are installed near the Central Avenue, 1st Street and 7th Street intersections. Installation of the signs was approved by Phoenix City Council during its Formal Meeting on November 16, 2022. </p>
  <p>The community gathered at 1st and Fillmore streets, and prior to the sign unveiling, listened to remarks given by Mayor Gallego, Vice Mayor Ansari, Downtown Phoenix Inc. Chief Growth Officer R.J. Price and Street Transportation Director Kini Knudson. Hughes' sister, Hana Kuykendall, offered final comments.</p>
  <p>Hughes passed away in September 2021 from injuries sustained during a car-bicycle collision near 1st and Fillmore streets in August 2021. The collision occurred as he rode his bike home from his job as a DPI Downtown Ambassador. Hughes served the downtown community as an Ambassador for 12 years, welcoming visitors and helping people find their way around the city. His radiant personality and baritone voice made him one of the most well-known, well-liked and recognizable Ambassadors. His family, friends and fellow Ambassadors described him as the "downtown superhero."<br></p>
  <p>As part of Phoenix's Ceremonial Street Sign Program, a requesting organization or individual is responsible for the fabrication, installation, maintenance and repair of ceremonial signs, which require City Council approval. The signs for this memorial bikeway were funded by City Council Districts 7 and 8. The Street Transportation Department fabricates and installs all of the city's street name, speed limit, traffic control and memorial signs. </p>
  <p>In addition to the installation of the ceremonial signs, in spring 2022, the Street Transportation Department removed parking and two traffic lanes along this section of Fillmore Street, and added buffered and protected bike lanes on both sides of the roadway.

  <span style="background-color:window;color:windowtext;font-size:10pt;">​The Phoenix City Council approved a $150,000 grant to rehabilitate a portion of the 63-year-old “City Center Motel" in the heart of downtown. The restoration of the historically designated main building is part of a larger project to build a new multi-story high-tech hotel.</span>
  <br>
  <p>The main building at 600 W. Van Buren Street, is a rare remaining example of “Googie-style" roadside architecture that was popular in the 1950s. The design includes concrete blocks and “space-age" features including the long, angular entryway and an extended sign with long blades. The architecture style catered to automobile traffic and the features were meant to get the attention of visitors driving by.</p>
  <p>City Council approved the historic designation of the building in November of 2022.  The main building and the annex building behind it were both built in 1959. The annex building, with a more common and functional design, was not deemed historically significant and will be demolished. </p>
  <p>The owner of the motel, Fabius Enterprise, LLC, will preserve the main building and incorporate it into the design for a $26.9 million hotel with a focus on new technology to better serve customers now and in the future. </p>
  <p>The City's Historic Preservation Office will work with the developer to ensure the rehabilitation is done to historic preservation standards. The work includes repairs to the structure and foundation and reversing alterations made over time. The Council allocated $500,000 in grant funds in its 2022-2023 budget to provide grants like this to preserve and restore threatened buildings.</p>

  <p>​​</p>
  <p>The City of Phoenix Budget and Research Department has added a 12th budget hearing for virtual and in-person participation as part of its ongoing commitment to ensuring the City's budgeting process is transparent and accessible for all residents. </p>
  <p>The additional budget hearing will take place on Tuesday, April 11, 2023, at 5:30 p.m. online and at  Phoenix City Council Chambers (200 W. Jefferson Street). Residents will be able to comment virtually from a computer or mobile device.</p>
  <p>During the month of April, the Budget and Research Department is hosting 11 other in-person community budget hearings, and one virtual/in-person hearing, inviting residents to attend and give public comment on the Trial Budget. The schedule of budget hearings can be found at <a target="_blank" href="https://phoenix.gov/budget/hearings"><strong>Phoenix.gov/budget/hearings</strong></a>.</p>
  <p>This proposed Trial Budget for fiscal year 2023-24 includes $14 million for service additions in key City Council priority areas such as: public safety and criminal justice, including adding firefighters to staff a new Fire station located at 19th Avenue and Chandler Boulevard which will help to improve response times; further efforts to civilianize positions in the Police Department to allow sworn officers to respond to higher level public safety calls for service; resources to continue important expiring grant funded programs to support low-income residents and victims of crime; resources are also proposed to add park rangers for overnight patrol at City parks, and increases for community arts grant funding. Additionally, $1 million is reserved for community input and recommendations reflecting resident comments gathered over the next several weeks. Based on available funds some of the suggestions could be incorporated into the final City Manager's Budget scheduled to be presented to City Council on May 2nd. The remaining $5 million would be allocated to the General Fund contingency fund, or rainy-day fund to account for proposed ongoing spending initiatives.</p>
  <p>The 2023-24 Trial Budget also proposes to allocate resources to address employee compensation, so we can provide the highest level of service ensuring our most valuable assets are paid competitively and positions can be filled with the best talent available. The City is experiencing significant vacancy rates due to the competitive labor market and therefore approximately 85%, or $114 million, of the total $134 million surplus in the 2023-24 Trial Budget is allocated to employee compensation. This investment in our employees is necessary and will help to fill vacant positions so the services residents rely on and expect can continue to be provided with improved service levels.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>What is the General Fund?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>The General Fund is part of the City of Phoenix's total budget. The General Fund is made up of resources including general sales tax, property taxes, revenue distributed by the state from income tax, sales and vehicle license taxes, and some fines and fees. The General Fund supports many of the services our residents, visitors, and businesses have come to expect in Phoenix such as libraries, parks, senior and youth programs and police and fire services.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>What's Next?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>After community review, City Manager Barton will present a revised proposed budget to the Phoenix City Council on May 2, 2023. The City Council is expected to decide on the budget on May 16, 2023. The approved budget will take effect July 1, 2023.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Community Input</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Residents are encouraged to participate in upcoming in-person budget hearings. The community is also encouraged to use the City's FundPHX interactive tool to provide input. The <a target="_blank" href="https://phoenix.gov/fund"><strong>FundPHX tool</strong></a> allows residents to provide direct feedback on the proposed FY 2023-24 Trial Budget additions. All input received from the tool, at the budget hearings, or by contacting the Budget and Research Department directly at budget.research@phoenix.gov or by calling (602) 262-4800 will be provided to the City Council, so they may consider your feedback prior to adopting the budget.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Community Budget Hearings</strong>
  </p>
  <p>The City of Phoenix is holding 12 budget hearings including one bilingual community-wide hearing and community-wide hearings for youth and arts. <br> <br><strong>Hearing schedule:</strong></p>

  <p>
  ​PHOENIX (March 10, 2023) – The City of Phoenix has taken a significant stride in the investment of its west side community. In hopes of partnering with community members to revitalize the area, along with the redevelopment of Metro Center and nearby health care facilities, the City of Phoenix (City) purchased the former Kmart building located at the northwest corner of I-17 and Northern Avenue. Plans are underway for renovations of the site to transform it into a much needed, state-of-the-art workforce training and education facility, appropriately named the Innovation 27 Workforce Training and Education Collaborative.<br></p>
  <p>The City, along with education partners: Arizona State University (ASU), Maricopa County Community College District (MCCCD), and Western Maricopa Education Center (West-MEC), intend to provide advanced education opportunities and workforce development to support this area of Phoenix in both its workforce and businesses. The former Kmart building has been vacant for the past five years and is one of the last remaining large infill sites located along a major freeway in Phoenix that is available for redevelopment.</p>
  <p>In 2022, the Phoenix City Council approved the 27th Avenue Corridor Community Safety and Crime Prevention Plan, which directly focuses on the community. Innovation 27 is an essential part of the solution to help combat those safety and economic issues. Residents currently experience barriers to education opportunities, food deserts, and access to transportation to other training facilities in the valley. Training opportunities anticipated for this site are expected to prepare individuals for careers in the semiconductor, public safety, bioscience, information technology, food innovation, and healthcare fields. </p>
  <p>“With the Innovation 27 Workforce Training and Education Collaborative, we are taking a major step forward in providing our community with the resources and opportunities needed to develop a strong workforce here in Phoenix. This state-of-the-art facility will be a hub for training and education that will empower our residents to become leaders in critical fields and help drive economic growth in our city," said Mayor Kate Gallego. </p>
  <p>“We are working hard to bring opportunity to the residents of west Phoenix," said Councilwoman Betty Guardado. “Thanks to the vision and determination of our local neighborhood leaders, Innovation 27 will become an education and workforce catalyst for the entire community."</p>
  <p>"We appreciate the leadership of the city of Phoenix in helping to advance a location and facility that provides easy access for the public and we believe that Innovation 27 represents a welcome opportunity in the West Valley for ASU to partner with others to advance learning opportunities for residents working to upskill and reskill for career advancement," said Todd Sandrin, Vice Provost of ASU West. “Our university charter calls upon us not only to be accessible and inclusive but also to take responsibility for the communities we serve and we look forward to contributing to the success of this unique facility, providing ASU's state-of-the-art programs that empower learners to create new futures for themselves, their families, and the community." </p>
  <p>"The Maricopa Community Colleges are excited to partner with the City of Phoenix utilizing this location to help educate additional workforce and develop further opportunities for our students. We thank the Mayor, Councilwoman Guardado, and the rest of the Council for their entrepreneurial leadership on this property," said Chancellor Steven Gonzales.</p>
  <p>"With the tremendous growth being realized across multiple industries in Arizona, West-MEC values the opportunity to support the collaboration that is Innovation 27.  Innovation 27 illustrates the powerful linkages that exist between our region's education and training providers and how they can be leveraged in support of workforce development at the community level," said CJ Williams, Director of Business Development and Government Affairs.</p>
  <p>Innovation 27 provides a space for advanced education and job upskilling. It will focus on cultivating sustainable occupations that can withstand market volatility and foster entrepreneurship, creativity, and growth opportunities. Programs and classes in the buildings are estimated to begin in the fall of 2024.</p>

Smith subsequently resigned fromthe Academyand was banned from attending all Academy functions, including the Oscars, for ten years.[14]Early lifeSmith was born and raised inPhiladelphiaas Willard Carroll Smith II on September 25, 1968,  to Caroline (née Bright), a school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith Sr.,[15][16]a US Air Force veteran[17]and refrigeration engineer. His mother graduated fromCarnegie Mellon University.[18]Smith grew up in West Philadelphia'sWynnefieldneighborhood[19]and was raisedBaptist.[20]He has an elder sister named Pamela and two younger siblings, twins Harry and Ellen.[19]He attended Our Lady of Lourdes, a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia,[21]andOverbrook High School.[22]His parents separated when he was 13[23]and divorced around the year 2000.[24]Smith began rapping at age 12. When his grandmother found a notebook of his lyrics, which he described as containing "all [his] little curse words", she wrote him a note on a page in the book: "Dear Willard, truly intelligent people do not have to use words like this to express themselves. Please show the world that you're as smart as we think you are". Smith said that this influenced his decision not to use profanity in his music.[25]CareerFurther information:Will Smith filmography,Will Smith discography, andList of awards and nominations received by Will Smith1985–1992: DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh PrinceSmith at the Emmy Awards 1993Smith started as theMCof the hip-hop duoDJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, with his childhood friendJeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townesasturntablistand producer.[26]Townes and Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smith's residence, and he was missing hishype man. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype man finally made it to the party.[27]Soon after, the two decided to join forces. Smith enlisted a friend to join as the beatboxer of the group, Clarence Holmes akaReady Rock C, making them a trio. Philadelphia-based Word Records released their first single in 1986 whenA&RmanPaul Oakenfold[28]introduced them to Champion Records with their single "Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble," a tale of funny misadventures that landed Smith and his former DJ and rap partner Mark Forrest (Lord Supreme) in trouble.[29]The song sampled the theme song of "I Dream of Jeannie." Smith became known for light-hearted story-telling raps and capable, though profanity-free, "battle" rhymes. The single became a hit a month before Smith graduated from high school.[30]Based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention ofJive RecordsandRussell Simmons. The duo's first album,Rock the House, which was first released on Word Up in 1986 debuted on Jive in March 1987. The group received the firstGrammy Award for Best Rap Performancein 1989 for "Parents Just Don't Understand" (1988), though their most successful single was "Summertime" (1991), which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on theBillboardHot 100. Smith and Townes are still friends and claim that they never split up, having made songs under Smith's solo performer credit.[31]Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes.[26]TheInternal Revenue Serviceeventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, andgarnishedhis income.[32]Smith was struggling financially in 1990 when theNBCtelevision network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him.[26]The show was successful and began his acting career.

At least, that's been the excuse, although judging by the finished product, it was the script that never lived up to the promise of its premise."[97]Later that year, Smith had his second starring role in an animated film, inSpies in Disguise, oppositeTom Holland. Smith voiced Lance Sterling, a spy who teams up with the nerdy inventor who creates his gadgets (Holland).[98]In 2020, he reteamed with Martin Lawrence for the third film in their franchise,Bad Boys for Life.

I don’t know how else to say that.”“I’m just as much in shock and disbelief and was in disbelief as I watched it unravel,” she said of the incident, which she said “happened very quickly.”Buchheit-Sims said she didn’t directly work withthe gunman, Connor Sturgeon, but knew him because his father was her son’s high school basketball coach, and her husband was an assistant coach.She described Sturgeon as someone with “just kind of a monotone personality."“His temperament is pretty low-key.

He was pretty much just relaxed," she said.Buchheit-Sims said she didn’t know anything about Sturgeon having any grievances or previously making any threats.

He was killed by police shortly after opening fire, according to Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel, the interim chief of the department.Response:Officers arrived at the bank three minutes after the first call of the shooting, Gwinn-Villaroel said, adding that the fast response time saved lives. She said the gunman used a rifle.Investigation:Police did not have"any prior engagement"with the shooter, according to Gwinn-Villaroel. Investigators are working to learn more about the gunman. The shooting was live-streamed, Gwinn-Villaroel said, and that police are "hopeful" that they can get the footage taken offline.Victims:The four people killed were identified as Tommy Elliott, 63, Jim Tutt, 64, Josh Barrick, 40, and Juliana Farmer, 45, according toupdated informationfrom the police department.

To the people who survived, whether you were physically hurt or not, I know that you’re hurting too.

The thing is the president cannot do it alone… there is a legislative process that needs to happen and Congress needs to act.”The comments came hours afterfour people were killed in a mass shootingat a Louisville, Kentucky, bank.Specifically, she added, Biden cannot work without Congress to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require safe storage for firearms, require background checks for all gun safeties and eliminate gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability.Pressed on whether the president has done all he can, Jean-Pierre said, “We're always going to find and figure out ways that we can take another step outside of all of the historic steps that this president has taken to announce another way to protect communities, but the president has done the work. Now we need Congress to act.”She said Biden has "done a historic amount of work recently" and pointed to a bipartisan bill he signed into law that year.Jean-Pierre also clarified that the administration is continuing to call on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban, even though that was not mentioned in the president’s recent statement in response to the Louisville shooting.She said it was “not a shift in strategy at all. We were just being mindful to the incoming information that was currently coming in from Louisville.”share with Facebookshare with Twittershare with emailshare link4:20 p.m. ET, April 10, 2023Shooter was notified he would be fired from bank and left a note before shooting, source saysFrom CNN's John MillerPolice deploy at the scene of a shooting in downtown Louisville on Monday.

Whether it be acting, singing, rapping, or producing, the Smiths can do seemingly anything—including investing in numerous impressive properties across the globe. Much like the multi-hyphenate couple themselves, their real estate portfolio has quite the range, including a massive Calabasas mansion—and even a $2.5 million motor home (yes, really!). Below, take a look at all nine properties that Mr. and Mrs. Smith have called home over the last two decades.An $11.3 Million Mansion, Hidden Hills, CaliforniaIn September of 2021,Dirtreported that the Smiths purchased an $11.3 million mansion in Hidden Hills, with six bedrooms and seven-and-a-half bathrooms. The 10,417-square-foot pad sits on 1.19 acres and boasts a refrigerated wine closet, a soundproof movie theater, and a game room with a wet bar.A $937,500 Dwelling, Bryn Mawr, PennsylvaniaGoogle EarthIn 1997—the year that Will and Jada got hitched—they purchased their first home together: a 8,000-square-foot abode in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania that cost $937,500, according toVariety. So, why did the couple first set roots in Pennsylvania? Well, just like he sings inThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Airtheme song, Will Smith really was born and raised in West Philadelphia—specifically Wynnefield—just 15 minutes from this sprawling pad. Evidently, you can take the fresh prince out of West Philly, but not for long…!A $700,000 Humble Abode, Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaVarietyreports that in 1998—just a year after purchasing their Bryn Mawr home—Will and Jada spent $700,000 on a 2,165-square-foot property north of Philadelphia. Not much else is known about this house, but it’s likely that the Smiths purchased both of these Pennsylvania dwellings to be close to Will’s family.Love knowing all the latest design trends?We’ve got you covered.A $3.4 Million Mansion, Hidden Hills, CaliforniaIn 2003, Will and Jada dropped $3.4 million on a five-bedroom, six-bathroom mansion in Hidden Hills, California, according toLoveProperty.com.  Ever since 2017, the couple’s son, Jaden, has called this place home—and he’s one of many celebs who lives in this star-studded city.Kylie Jenner,Drake, Miley Cyrus, andJennifer Lopezare also residents of Hidden Hills.A $2.5 Million Motor HomeThis content is imported from youTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.Celebrity Motor Homes (Will Smith 2 Story Trailer)Watch onYouTube IconYouTube IconWith a reported net worth of $350 million, Will Smith is one of the highest paid actors—so it only makes sense that he spends plenty of time on movie sets. Of course, this means he has to spend time away from his many homes, but fear not: He still has an impressive abode to live in while filming, thanks to his two-story motorhome that’s worth $2.5 million. Will lived in this RV while filming iconic films likeThe Pursuit of Happyness, Men in Black III,andAli, according toBusiness Insider. This particular vehicle—which is nicknamed The Heat—boasts 1,200 square feet, 14 TV screens, a dressing room, a movie theater that seats up to 30 people, and a 360-degree security camera. And you, too, can live like Will Smith if this lifestyle suits your vibe (but it might set you back a few thousand dollars)—an RV like this costs an estimated$9,000 a week.  Watch the above video for an inside look at this home on wheels!A $42 Million Mansion, Calabasas, CaliforniaGoogle EarthThe most expansive (and expensive) property in Will and Jada Smith’s real estate portfolio is a 25,000-square-foot Calabasas mansion that sits on 150 acres, according toLoveProperty.com. This spectacular abode took seven years to build, from 2003 to 2010, and the final product boasts nine bedrooms, an eight-car garage, its own movie theater, and a private recording studio—which is where the couple’s daughter, Willow, recorded her 2010 hit song “Whip My Hair.” And if all of that wasn’t impressive enough, this homealsohas its very own zip code—and it graced the cover ofArchitectural Digestback in 2011. It’s unclear just how much the Smiths paid for this extensive dwelling, but it was briefly listed for $42 million in 2014, not long before being taken off the market.A $13.5 Million Beach House, Hanalei, Kauai, HawaiiBack in 2009, Will and Jada Smith spent $13.5 million on a 2,200-square-foot abode in Hanalei, a small town on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, reportsThe Wall Street Journal. The three-bedroom, three-bathroom dwelling sits on seven acres—and the couple quickly (and impressively) flipped the property in 2011, selling it for $20 million.A $910,000 Mediterranean-Style Abode, Woodland Hills, CaliforniaIn August of 2010, the Smith family trust spent $910,000 on a 4,146-square-foot Mediterranean-style abode in Woodland Hills, California, according toVariety. This two-story property includes five bedrooms, 5.5 bathrooms, three fireplaces, a poolanda spa. Although it’s not clear who lives in this dwelling, it surely sounds worthy of Hollywood royalty.A $10 Million Compound, Kilauea, Kauai, HawaiiThis content is imported from youTube.

Will Smith's Car Collection Is FreshReadBuySellResearchAuctionsPodcastSign InSign UpSign upSign inReadBuySellResearchAuctionsPodcastAbout UsBecome a dealerSpeed DigitalTermsPrivacyCookiesAdvertiseBookmarksfeaturesmuscleWill Smith's Car Collection Is FreshOct 8, 2022—3 min readElizabeth PuckettAs one of the most famous people in the world, what has Will Smith's fame afforded him, automobile-wise?Young adults today may not realize where Will Smith even came from, they just know he's a household name today. However, anyone born pre-1990s knows that Will Smith was at one time everywhere. You couldn't turn on the television, radio, or go to the movies without seeing (or hearing) the name Will Smith. Depending on how pre-1990s you were, Smith was the big brother you wish you had, or the cool goofy guy you'd want to hang out with in the food court, and he would go on to star in some incredible films as the leading man role. So we have to wonder, of all the money he's amassed from this level of fame, has he spent some of it on a few dream cars? Let's check out his garage.Watch the latest Motorious Podcasthere.Maybach 57SA Maybach57S is sitting in Will Smith's garage, and this ultra-luxury car has serious class. In addition to being sleek and understates, it also has a 5.5-liter, twin-turbocharged V12, and shares a class with the Rolls-Royce Phantom.Rolls-Royce GhostContinuing with the luxury, the Rolls-Royce Ghost has a top speed for 155.3 miles per hour and costs upwards of $300K.Bentley AzureFor the sake of rounding off the price game, the most expensive car in Will Smith's collection is said to be this $370,000 number. It has 50 more horsepower than the Ghost, and has a top speed of 150 mph.1965 Ford MustangFinally, something a little more down to earth. While Will may have piloted a newer Shelby Mustang in I Am Legend, a 1965 Mustang is what earned a spot in his collection. Depending on the options, this could easily be the cheapest car Will Smith owns.Tesla RoadsterIf you're going to get a Tesla, might as well get a fast Tesla! This Roadster is capable of sprinting to 60 mph in 1.9-second, and has a top speed of 250 mph.BMW i8Powered by a turbocharged 1.5-liter I3 and 98 KW motor, the i8 is a 'future-meets- now' kind of car that you can't mistake for anything else on the road.Featured posts500 Festival Camaros Have Been UnveiledSteven Symes•11 Apr 2023Rihanna’s Driver’s Audi Has Been StolenSteven Symes•11 Apr 2023Students To Show Off 1953 Mercedes At Pebble Beach Concours D’ EleganceElizabeth Puckett•11 Apr 2023Explore topicsAmericannewshighlightsmusclenewsletterhandpickedsportsclassicclientmodern classicEuropefeatures60s70sluxurytruckscelebrityoff-roadexoticLooking for a vehicle?We’ve got your covered, check out our listings for

Of course, there are a few rappers that have done well for themselves, but at the same time, we feel it’s safe to say that no career—no matter how successful—can compare to that of the incomparable Will Smith.With charm, charisma, good looks, and a definitive funny side, Will Smith won over audiences for the first time playing an alter ego of himself on NBC’sThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. The moniker came from his earlier rap days, which also started to ignite the star that would eventually shine brightly over the skies of Hollywood.The show may have ended in 1996 but that only meant a newer and bigger beginning for Smith, as he launched one of the most impressive film careers in Hollywood, including an incredible list of films: Bad Boys, Independence Day, I, Robot, I Am Legend...and the list goes on.He is a prominent presence on social media, complete with his own online videos, which offer hilarious and a rather interesting look inside of his life, and his film projects are still top-notch, with films like the live actionAladdinon the way to theaters soon.Without further ado, we’ll be taking a look at the cars he owns as well as the cars and other vehicles he’s driven on screen and you may be surprised at a few of these, so come on and let’s take a ride with the Fresh Prince himself.20WILL'S ROLLS-ROYCEVIA premiumcars.clubWhy not start off the festivities with one of the classiest and most impressive cars in automotive history? Well, the Rolls Royce is an extravagant vehicle and one that has definitely proven its luster time and time again and Will Smith seems to agree, as he and his wife, Jada, have been seen with this car over and over again. The paparazzi are often getting quite a few shots of them around the car and driving it. Interestingly enough, Jada is often seen at the wheel of this one, which proves two things: his wife has also got great taste in cars and he doesn't mind sharing his cars with her.19AN ACTOR'S ACTORVIA E! NewsIn theFresh Prince, Smith showcased an incredible flair for what was funny and had extremely good timing, but the show’s writers and actors didn’t waste any time in proving that the cast could act when storylines turned serious. Case in point: when Will’s character’s father, who had left him, returns, only to leave once again. The scene that unfolds at the end of that episode with Will and castmate, Uncle Phil, played expertly by the late, great James Avery, still tears at the heartstrings of viewers who watch it back after all these years.18THE AUDI FROMI, ROBOTVIA illinois-liver.orgNo stranger to working on films adapted from classic novels, in 2004, Will brought to the screen a character and team of robots made famous by Isaac Asimov, one of the fathers of literary science fiction, in a huge blockbuster film. And the robots themselves weren't the only impressive pieces of machinery in that film, as the vehicles featured were also, in fact, quite impressive to see. In particular, the Audi pictured here. Yes, the car is fictional—essentially a concept car similar to the TT that was developed by Audi specifically for the film—after all, the film did represent a futuristic era but it was definitely beautiful just the same and we felt it was worth mentioning here.17WILL'S MAYBACH 57SVIA MotorwardThis vehicle is manufactured by Daimler AG and was previously manufactured by Daimler-Chrysler. It first went into production back in 2002 and production ceased in 2012. So it pretty much had a ten year run on the assembly line, but that's not to say that many were, in fact, produced in that decade. Only 3,000 or just over that number were actually produced, many of which are now in circulation and Mr. Smith is, in fact, the proud owner of one of them. To look at this vehicle on the surface, it seems rather plain, but as they say, dear readers, never judge a book by its cover.16THE SHELBY MUSTANG FROMI AM LEGENDVIA canacopegdl.comThe novel entitledI Am Legendhas inspired three films over the long years since its publication and in his lifetime, author Richard Matheson was able to see all three. But perhaps the best of the three came in 2007 and it starred none other than Will Smith as the main character, Dr. Robert Neville. The film was a pulse-pounding thriller that also tugged at the heartstrings of audiences worldwide and its poignancy wasn't missed by one and all, either. Also featured in the film was an incredibly gorgeous Mustang Shelby in cherry red and striped with white. An incredible scene in which the character drives the car through the deserted streets of New York City is definitely memorable—at least for car aficionados, that is.15WILL'S 1965 FORD MUSTANGVIA bringatrailer.comBut the car inI Am Legendisn't the Shelby that Will owns and possesses in his own garage back home. In fact, when it comes to the greatest car Ford ever built, Will seems to appreciate a more classic variation of the car and, well, old-school is definitely better and we are sure many of you readers would agree. One look at the classic 1965 beauty pictured here and we can more than understand Mr. Smith's love and adoration for the car. It calls to mind simpler times, more powerful vehicles, and a sort of nostalgia that only cars like this can inspire. We can see Will riding in this one, maybe a sigh escapes him as he thinks back on his epic career and life.14THE SMITH FAMILYVIA DNA IndiaPictured here are Will Smith, his wife (and fellow actress), Jada, his daughter, Willow, and his two sons, Trey and Jaden. They've all spent some time in the public eye on TV, film, and even appearances on the glorified red carpet of Hollywood, but they can be seen on his online channel along with the cast of characters that make up Will's life. The antics and adventures he's up to there are, in fact, hilarious and seeing him in his everyday life is rather comical and interesting to watch. He takes his viewers on vacation with his family and even to the sets of some of his films. Whatever the occasion, it's always worth the time for an episode, which can go anywhere from under ten minutes to just slightly over.13MERCEDES GL 450VIA kengarffmercedes.comAnd, of course, for a family man such as Will, what would his existence be without the luxury of an SUV? We can definitely all agree; with a large family, small compact cars can get a little difficult at times, especially when planning road trips. Sometimes, one needs to squeeze three kids and, most importantly, all their stuff in the trunk and a larger vehicle such as this one will definitely do the trick. But at the same time, you don't have to sacrifice style in order to make things easier on themselves, as Will proves with the inclusion of this luxury SUV in his personal collection.12SINGING IN HIS CARS!?VIA Rolling StonePictured here with Will is none other than James Corden, host of theLate Late Showand, of course, his darling creation,Carpool Karaoke, a hilarious production in which he sits and drives with A-List Hollywood celebrities and sings some of the most popular songs on the air at the current time. The show has gone on to have other hosts but the original episodes remain as some of the most hilarious to date. One, in particular, is the episode with none other than our main man, Will. The antics definitely delivered a few laughs and left many wondering if Will sings in his own collection of cars when he's out there driving on his own.11THEI, ROBOTCHOPPERVIA Sportbikes.netOrange County Choppers, featured on the Discovery Channel'sAmerican Chopper,quickly became one of the most successful reality shows based on automotive fabrication—and for good reason. The bikes they build are some of the greatest in the world and, of course, the antics showcased on the show have also made the cast of colorful characters the most sought-after reality stars of the last two decades—and for good reason. Early in the show's run on Discovery, they made a bike dedicated to the release of the filmI, Robotand they did a fine job, likening the bike to the robots featured in the film. The bike was unveiled at the premiere of the film and Will posed for shots with the fabricators and the bike.10WILL'S CADILLAC ESCALADE ESVVIA CnetWell, as we mentioned before, Will definitely can use some SUVs in his life and he's got a few, but this one, in particular, goes that extra mile as far as style is concerned. The Cadillac Escalade has become "the" car in terms of status arrival in Hollywood; especially in the rap community. It's similar to how back in the day, stars like Elvis had fun celebrating success with a pink Cadillac. Today, that same success is put on display in the form of yet another Cadillac and this time, the Caddy in question is bigger and badder. So can we blame good Mr. Smith for choosing to have one of these big boys in his collection? Hardly.9THEI, ROBOTSPORTS BIKE FEATURED IN THE FILMVIA Bikes - BestCarMag.comOf course, theI, Robotchopper isn't the only bike featured in the film. As we mentioned earlier, the film is full of impressive and futuristic vehicles. But there is one vehicle that actually did exist in real life and in the present time and that was the MV Agusta F4 750 SPR, one of the most celebrated sports bikes on the market. Still today, after many years on the market, the bike is looked upon as being one of the best and, of course, in the film, it performed incredibly and was showcased in the most alluring and flattering light. Honestly, though, how can anyone make one of these beauties look bad? We're sure it would look and perform beautifully even if it had the worst paint job imaginable.8A SPY IN DISGUISEVIA carmagazine.co.ukSmith's future film projects are lining up quite nicely and he seems to be one of the busiest men in the game, with perhaps the exception of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. Regardless, Will has a magnitude of films slated for release and one of them is none other than an animated film,Spies In Disguise, scheduled for release in 2019. And yes, that's Smith's character right up there, a slick-as-ever spy, cool as a cucumber and dressed to impress—kind of likeJames Bond. And what would a spy film be without some of the most impressive vehicles on the market? Let's be honest, that Audi pictured there is enough to make any car aficionado happy, even if it is only a cartoon.7WILL'S FORD TAURUSVIA Leithcars.comEven a multi-million-dollar celebrity needs a "normal" car every now and again. And one can't find a more normal car than the Ford Taurus. We would imagine it definitely helps when Will and his family want to be a little less conspicuous. And a car like this one will, or definitely should, keep the seeking eyes of the paparazzi and their camera lenses away. But then again, Will and his family are pretty easy to spot, all of them being quite prominent in our culture but hey, we guess it's worth a shot. And next time you're driving around and see a Taurus, you might just be surprised to see Will at the wheel singing away to some tunes. Don't say we didn't warn you.6THE INFAMOUS MIKE LOWREY CARSVIA IMCDb.orgPerhaps one of the greatest and most successful franchises in the action-comedy genre is none other than theBad Boysfilms. Two of them were released thus far, the last one coming in the early portion of this millennium but the incredible news that they're working and filming a third one definitely made a lot of fans happy. The characters of Lowrey and Burnett, played expertly by Martin Lawrence and Will Smith, are truly some of the greatest to ever hit the big screen and what's more, the action that unfolds on screen, as well as the comedy and antics, are some of the most entertaining ever. But for us gearheads out there, the cars that the infamous Mike Lowrey drives in the films are some pretty fine pieces of automotive machinery, particularly the 2002 Ferrari 575M pictured here fromBad Boys II.5WILL'S BMW I8VIA BMW CanadaDefinitely in the same tastes as his character Mike inBad Boys, this car from his personal collection definitely shows Will's range when it comes to taste and knowledge of what a fine vehicle is. Of all the BMW vehicles on the market, this one is probably considered one of the greatest in terms of style and yes, even performance. It just screams class and in a way that only some of the greatest luxury cars can. It puts itself in the rank of the Maseratis, Lamborghinis, and even the wonderful and extravagant Mercedes models of the world. Maybe a few of you won't agree but at the same time, can't we all agree that the vehicle is at least the best designed by the ladies and gents at BMW?4WILL'S BENTLEY AZUREVIA Classic DriverStaying in that grand theme of what we call class, what would a "classy" car collection such as Will's be without a Bentley? The Bentley, in and of itself, is one of the most respected vehicles known to man and for very good reason. And by that same token, it is also one of the most expensive. But hey, what are all the huge payouts for roles and appearances for if not to reward himself every now and again? He deserves it; after all, he earned his money and his success. Besides, Will Smith is also considered one of the nicest celebrities in Hollywood, so who out there can blame him for wanting the finer things in life?3THE INFAMOUS MOBILE MANSION (PART 1)VIA Review SpewActors and athletes on a big scale need to travel all over the world and that means that they often miss the comforts of home while being on the road and always on the go. But Will found a way to bring his home with him and of course, this home away from home comes in the form of a vehicle. Could we expect anything less from this man? Hardly. In doing our research for this article we were privy to some pretty incredible images of this mammoth machine and it is definitely impressive. Of course, that's putting it rather mildly! Readers, there are many that would live in this thing 24/7 and 365 days out of the year, yours truly included.2THE INFAMOUS MOBILE MANSION (PART 2)VIA andersonmobileestates.comIt can definitely be considered a mansion. This isn't (at all) your granddaddy's touring van from the days of old, folks. This beast on 16 wheels is definitely equipped to handle all of your household needs. We wonder only what the market value on such a vehicle would be. But for celebrities like Smith, who love to have their families with them, this is an advantageous acquisition to have. Imagine being able to go all over the world, filming and performing and being able to enjoy dinner with the family at day's end? Definitely, that's a cool way to spend a few months. Imagine a road trip in one of these!1MOVING FORWARDVIA zig.comAt the end of the day, this actor and public figure has definitely left his mark on society and what a mark it has been. But he's showing no signs of slowing down, asAladdingets set to premiere with Smith in a role made famous by the late, great Robin Williams. But the new version is the much-anticipated live-action version and, well, we can't wait to see it. Overall, we look upon his career and upcoming films and look on in wonder and excitement—an excitement that probably brings us back to the golden years of Hollywood. Now, if that doesn't sum up nostalgia for the past in terms of films of the era, cars from the era, and the simpler times of the era, we don't know what will.Sources: Wikipedia, IMDb, and Variety.ShareTweetShareShareCopyEmailShareShareTweetShareShareCopyEmailLink copied to clipboardRelated TopicsAbout The AuthorDom M(130 Articles Published)CloseCar RendersThis Modern Ford Capri Finally Becomes A True Muscle Car9 hours agoForget The Lamborghini Sterrato: The Urus Baja Racer Is Really Ready For Some Action18 hours ago90s Coupes Fever: The Cadillac Eldorado Is Back In Business2 days agoSee MoreTrending90s Coupes Fever: The Cadillac Eldorado Is Back In BusinessSee Nicole Johnson Meet The Chevrolet Corvette-Based, 500-HP MGWhy Everyone Is Questioning The New Dodge Challenger Demon 170’s 0-60 MPH TimeHomeWrite For UsAbout UsAdvertise With UsContact UsTermsPrivacyCopyrightPress KitFact Checking PolicyCorrections PolicyEthics PolicyOwnership PolicyCopyright © 2023 www.hotcars.com

Smith’s Tesla Roadster can go as fast as 250 mph while the BMW i8 is the most futuristic looking.Today, we will be highlighting the oldest car in his collection which is a 1965 Ford Mustang. Even though it is the cheapest one in his collection, it’s stylish, economical, and historical making it the most popular muscle car nationally and internationally.Why Did Will Smith Get A Ford Mustang?You may remember Will Smith riding a 2007 Shelby GT500 Mustang in his character role as Robert Neville in the 2007 film, “I Am Legend.” There were only 6 in production and this model is the only one of its kind left in the world. It was once listed on eBay for $27,000 and the dealer had it listed at $85,000, which is much less than other movie cars that have been sold online before.This is not the same Mustang that Smith owns today. While the model in the movie was exclusively signed by the late Carroll Shelby himself, Smith’s 1965 Ford Mustang is just your ordinary ride with all the bells and whistles of the first and foremost original Ford Mustang model.What’s So Special About The 1965 Ford Mustang?The Fresh Prince owns the freshest Mustang wheels in history. In 2020 and 2021, the Mustang was voted the best muscle car sold internationally. The maximum 271 horsepower makes the vehicle a powerhouse.The first Ford Mustang cost under $2,500 when it was originally released in April 1964. Fast forward to the present day, it costs about $20,000. Its cheaper cost does not undermine how symbolic of a vehicle this is amongst Smith’s collection of cars.The 289 CID V-8 makes the Ford Mustang have cost-effective maintenance for a long-running reliable vehicle. If you had to modify it in any way, it could be easily done.Ready, Set, Go, Mustang!Ok, Will Smith is no Nascar driver. However, Mustangs make great racing cars because of their rear-wheel drive. The new model of the Ford Mustang MT3 is being modeled and will be released for competing in the International Motor Sports Race event in 2024.

Will Smith, who plays the role of Dr. Robert Neville, a virologist for the US Army.
The film, which was based on the novel of the same name written by author Richard
Matheson, tells the story of how a virus, intended for curing cancer, spread
throughout the country and affecting most of mankind. Immune to the virus,
Neville explores New York City with his dog, Sam, as they try to look for other
survivors.I Am Legendbecame one of
the most successful films of that year, becoming the 7thhighest-grossing
film of 2007.I Am Legend Inspired Dog Names in Pop CultureFeatured Famous I Am Legend DogSamBecause of the great storyline and the superb acting by Will Smith and the other cast members, it is no surprise that the movie went on to become a blockbuster. However, as impressive as Smith was in the movie, his performance was overshadowed by one of the most memorable characters in the film – his German Shepherd, Sam.Set in New York City,I Am Legendtells the story of how a re-engineered measles virus, which was developed to cure cancer, accidentally wipes out the majority of mankind and turned some into vampiric and nocturnal creatures, known as Darkseekers. In the film, Robert Neville (played by Smith) discovers that he is the only surviving human in the city as he is immune to the virus. With no friends or family left, Robert’s only constant companion is Sam.In flashbacks, it was revealed that Sam actually came from Neville’s daughter, Marley. During the outbreak of the Krippin virus on Christmas Eve, Robert was taking his wife, Zoe, daughter, Marley, and Sam to an evacuation point. Before the helicopter that was carrying Zoe and Marley left, Marley decided to give Sam to Robert so that he’ll have someone with him. Despite protests from Robert, he eventually took Sam. Then, moments after, the helicopter carrying the two got caught in an accident, killing all those on board. From that moment on, Sam became Robert’s sole companion.All throughout the movie, the loyalty and dedication of Robert and Sam towards each other were highlighted. During the three years that they have been together, they had several routines, including hunting deer and waiting for possible survivors at South Street Seaport. They also went through some challenging times, such as being chased by Darkseekers and Robert getting caught in a snare trap while Sam stayed to watch over him.Unfortunately, it was during this moment when Sam had to fight for her life. After a Darkseeker arrives at the Grand Terminal Station and releases three dogs infected by the virus, Robert and Sam try their best to kill the dogs. However, during this encounter, Sam was bitten by one of the dogs and infected by the virus. After getting home, Robert tries to save Sam using a cure but to no avail. Eventually, Sam gets infected and tries to attack Robert. As a result, he reluctantly strangles Sam to death.The death of Sam was one of the most heartbreaking scenes from the movie because of the pain that Robert felt about having to kill his own best friend and the one thing that he had left. Sam’s death pushed Robert over the edge and gave him the courage to fight off the Deathseekers. In the end, Robert sacrificed his life to destroy the Darkseekers and enable Anna and Ethan to escape with the cure.I Am Legend Inspired Dog Name ConsiderationsGiving a forever name for your dog could seem like a very
exciting task to take on. However, there’s actually a lot of weight that comes
with it; after all, the name that you eventually pick is the one that your dog
will carry for the rest of their lives. There are times when choosing a name
can be overwhelming, given the number of possibilities and options that are
available to you.Most dog owners know that the best names for their furry
friends are ones that are no longer than two to three syllables. This is
because, generally, dogs have a hard time remembering long names and will only
retain the first few syllables of any word. Owners should also avoid picking
names that sound a lot like the commands they use for their dogs.Sometimes, dog owners also take inspiration from some of
their personal favorites, such as films. For fans of the filmI Am Legend,there are lots of possible names
for dogs inspired by the movie. The name Samantha, which happens to be the name
of Will Smith’s dog in the movie, is a popular choice, especially for those who
own German Shepherds. You can also use the names of the different cast and
characters from the film.Male I Am Legend Inspired Dog NamesVotesNameVote1SamNickname of the German Shepherd in the movie1DashAfter actor Dash Mihok, who played the alpha male Darkseeker in the film1MikeA character in the film1DarrellAfter actor Darrell Foster, who plays Mike in the film0EthanA character in the film0FrancisAfter director Francis Lawrence0LegendAfter the film’s title, I Am Legend0KonaThe real name of one of the German Shepherds who played Sam0JayA character in the film0SamuelAfter actor Samuel Glen, who played Jay in the film0RichardAfter author Richard Matheson, who wrote the novel which inspired the film0BrooklynAfter the place where most of the scenes from the film were shot0FraleyAfter Pat Fraley, the actor who voiced the US President in the film0PattonAfter Mike Patton, the actor who voiced the Darkseekers in the film0PedroAfter Pedro Mojica, who played one of the sergeants in the film0TahanAfter actor Charlie Tahan, who played Ethan in the film0LawrenceThe family name of director Francis Lawrence0MazzaAfter Anthony Mazza, who played one of the cops in the film0GlenAfter actor Samuel Glen0TyreeAfter Tyree Michael Simpson, who played one of the cops in the film0CirbusAfter Steve Cirbus, one of the military policemen in the film0BenAfter Ben Cortman, Robert’s neighbor in the novel version0AkivaAfter Akiva Goldsman, one of the screenwriters of the film0MarkAfter Mark Protosevich, one of the screenwriters of the film-1WillAfter actor Will Smith, the star of the film-1SmithAfter actor Will Smith-1RobertAfter character Robert Neville, the main protagonist of the film-1NevilleFamily name of Robert, the main protagonist of the film-1CharlieAfter actor Charlie Tahan, who plays Ethan in the film-1DarkseekerThe vampiric mutants in the filmFemale I Am Legend Inspired Dog NamesVotesNameVote0SamanthaRobert’s German Shepherd in the film0AnnaA character in the film0MontezAnna’s family name in the film0AliceAfter Alice Braga, the actress who played Anna Montez0ZoeRobert’s wife in the film0MarleyRobert’s daughter in the film0SalliAfter actress Salli Richardson, who played Zoe Neville in the film0WillowAfter actress Willow Smith, who played Marley in the film0AliceAfter Dr. Alice Krippin, a character in the film who creates the cure0KrippinDr. Alice’s family name; also the name of the virus0JoannaAfter Joanna Numata, who played the alpha female of the Darkseekers0BragaAfter actress Alice Braga0NumataAfter Joanna Numata, one of the actresses in the film0AprilAfter April Grace, one of the minor actresses in the film0GraceAfter April Grace, one of the minor actresses in the film0AbbeyThe name of one of the German Shepherd dogs who played Sam in the film0MarinAfter Marin Ireland, one of the minor actresses in the film0CaitlinAfter Caitlin McHugh, one of the minor actresses in the film0CalistaAfter Calista Hill, one of the minor actresses in the film0GabrielaAfter Gabriela Hill, one of the minor actresses in the film0MadelineAfter Madeline Hill, one of the minor actresses in the film0AnikaAfter Anika Ellis, one of the minor actresses in the film0BrookAfter Katherine Brook, one of the minor actresses in the film0LynnaAfter Lynna Davis, one of the minor actresses in the film0CourtneyAfter Courtney Munch, one of the minor actresses in the film0ShannonAfter Kimberly Shannon Murphy, one of the minor actresses in the film0HollieAfter Hollie Seidel, one of the minor actresses in the film0HannahAfter Hannah Sim, one of the minor actresses in the film0HeatherAfter Heather Lang, one of the minor actresses in the film0AppleAfter Big Apple, the nickname of New York City, where the film was setWritten by a Shiba Inu loverPam GuecoPublished: 10/12/2018, edited: 05/31/2020More articles by Pam GuecoDoctor Who Dog NamesDog Names Meaning FastDotA Dog NamesCommunity Dogs With I Am Legend Inspired NamesShare Your Dog's I Am Legend Inspired Name?Share storyYou May Also LikeDoctor Who Dog NamesAlaskan Klee Kai Dog NamesDog Names that Start with AvThe Lion King Dog NamesBreaking Bad Dog NamesDog Names that Start with CrDog Names that Start with LSamoyed Dog NamesBest 3-Letter Dog NamesThe Last Ship Inspired Dog NamesMindhunter Inspired Dog NamesVictoria Dog NamesDog Names Meaning CherishedPointer Dog NamesAryan Molossus Dog NamesDog Names That Start With EfHelp CenterDownload the Wag! appAbout Wag!Trust and SafetyDo not share my infoCommunity GuidelinesWag!

WuKyle the cockapoo(left)and Baby Jeff the exotic shorthair cat(Courtesy of Sean O'Brien and Brittany Means)October 24, 2022ShareSaved StoriesSaveLong, long ago—five years, to be precise—Jeff Owens accepted that his calls to the vet would tax his fortitude. When the person on the other end asks his name, Owens, a test scorer in Albuquerque, says, “Jeff.” When they ask for his cat’s name, he has to tell them, “Baby Jeff.” The black exotic shorthair, a wheezy female with a squashed face and soulful orange eyes,isnamed for Owens, says his partner, Brittany Means,whose tweet about Jeff and Baby Jeff went viral this past spring. The whole thing started as a joke several years ago, when Means started calling every newcomer to their home—the car, the couch—“Baby Jeff.” Faced with blank adoption paperwork in 2017, the couple realized that only one name would do.Baby Jeff is a weird (albeit very good!) name, but it’s not as weird as it would have been a century or two ago. In the U.S., and much of the rest of the Western world, we’re officially living in an era of bequeathing unto our pets someratherhumannames. It’s one of the most prominent reminders that these animals have become “members of the family,” says Shelly Volsche, an anthropologist at Boise State University, to the point where they’re ascribed “agency and personhood.” The animals in our homes commonly receiveso many of the acts of lovepeople shower on the tiny humans under their care; pets share our beds, our diets, our clothes. So why not our names, too?The names and nature of the human-animal bond weren’t always this way. Kathleen Walker-Meikle, a medieval historian at the Science Museum Group and the author ofMedieval Pets, has found records from the Middle Ages describing dogs with names that alluded to some part of their physical appearance (Sturdy or Whitefoot), or an object that appealed to their human (a 16th-century Swiss wagoner once owned a dog named Speichli, or “Little Spoke”). Details on cats are sparser, Walker-Meikle told me, but some Old Irish legal texts make mention of a few felines, among them Cruibne (“little paws”) and Bréone (“little flame”).Jeff (right) and Baby Jeff (Brittany Means)Even when people-ish namesdidappear during this era, and the few centuries following, they trended zany, cheeky, cutesy, even pop-cultural—nothing that would be easily mistaken for a child’s given name. The 18th-century English painter William Hogarth named his pug Trump—perhaps an anglicization of a Dutch admiral called Tromp, according to Stephanie Howard-Smith, a pet historian at King’s College London. Catherine Parr, the last of King Henry VIII’s six wives, had a dog called Gardiner, after the anti-Protestant Bishop of Winchester. “This was her enemy, who wanted to destroy her,” Walker-Meikle told me. The idea was “to take the piss out of” him.Then, as the Victorian eraushered in the rise of official dog breeds, people began to reconceptualize the roles that canines could play in their homes. Once largely relegated to working roles, dogs more often became status symbols, and items of luxury—and as their status grew, so did the list of names they could acceptably bear. People no longer considered it such “a slight, necessarily, to share your name with a dog,” Howard-Smith told me. Diminutive names for animals—Jack or Fanny rather than John or Frances—became more common, too, paving the path for even more overlap down the line.Read: Humans can’t quit a basic myth about dog breedsThe big boom happened in the 20th century, and by its latter half, lists of the most popular dog and baby names were gettingawfully hardto tell apart. Nowadays, you could probably “go to a playground and shout ‘Alice!,’ and perhaps both dogs and girls would come rushing to you,” says Katharina Leibring, an expert in language and dialect at Uppsala University, in Sweden. Cats, meanwhile, seem to “have been kind of behind the curve in getting human names,” or perhaps receiving any names at all, Volsche told me. Even in 19th-century texts, Howard-Smith has spotted accounts from families who named their dogs, but would refer to “the cat” as only that.Findingssuch as these haveheldtrueacrossseveral countries, but pet naming trends have never been universal. InTaiwan, for example, dogs and cats might get food names, onomatopoeic names, or evenEnglishhuman names, such as Jasper or Bill. They don’t, however, “getChinesehuman names,” which hold particular significance, says Lindsey Chen, a linguist at National Taiwan Normal University. “We love them, but they’re not humans.” In Togo, the Kabre people sometimes name their dogs withpointed phrases—such asPaféifééri, or “they are shameless”—that, when spoken aloud,communicate their frustrations with otherhumanswithout confronting them directly.American animals who lack human-esque names aren’t loved any less, but the degree of intimacy we have with modern companion animals may almost demand anthropomorphism. Joann Biondi, a photographer in Miami, does not view her Maine coon as a “pet”; afrequent model for her artwork, he is her travel companion, her roommate, her business partner—“a creature who shares my life,” she told me. When she adopted him 13 years ago, she wanted a name befitting of his dignified features. But he also “looked like a hairy Italian soccer player,” Biondi told me, so she chose Lorenzo, sometimes tacking “Il Magnifico” onto the end.Lorenzo the cat (Joann Biondi)Several experts told me they’d feel a bit uncomfortable if a close family member decided to name a new pet after them. “There is still a reluctance to call animals things that really make them soundindistinguishablefrom a human,” Walker-Meikle told me. But some pet owners are downright inspired by that uncanny valley, including Sean O’Brien, an enterprise-software salesperson in Iowa, who deliberately sought out a very human name for his cockapoo, Kyle. “It’s just funny to see people’s reactions, like, ‘Did you sayKyle?’” he told me.Read: Why so many Millennials are obsessed with dogsLucy the pug (Shelly Volsche)A smidge of the species barrier can still be found in the ways some owners play with their pets’ names. Howard-Smith’s family dogs, Winnie and Arabella, have been gifted some unhuman monikers: Babby Ween, the Weenerator; Bubs, Bubski, Ballubbers, Ballubber-lubbers. Volsche’s pug, Lucy, is frequently dubbed Pug Nugget, Chunky Monkey, and Lucy, Devourer of Snackies, Demander of Attention. My own cats, Calvin and Hobbes, enjoy titles such as Chumbowumbo, Chino Vatican, Fatticus Finch, Herbal Gerbil, and Classic Herbs. Children with nicknames this unhinged would suffer all kinds of public humiliation. But with pets, “I think we can be a bit freer,” Howard-Smith told me. It’s funny; it’s embarrassing; it’s “a snapshot into someone’s relationship with their pet.” These are the impromptu names that are offered up in private, and the animals can’t complain.Means and Owens, Baby Jeff’s people, plan to keep giving their animals starkly human names. In addition to the cat, their home is also shared by a quartet of chickens: Ludwing van Beaktoven; Johenn Sebastian Bawk; Brittany, Jr. (named for Means, of course—“it was my turn,” she told me); and Little Rachel (named for their human roommate). The next bird they adopt will be named Henjamin, in honor of Means’s brother Ben. But Means and Owens, too, have a sense for which names just don’t feel quiteright. “I knew this guy with a cat named Michael,” Means said. “Every time I think of it, it blows me away.”​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

It's none of your businessThis article is more than 7 years oldDavid MarshShould anyone still be asking this question – or using the phrase ‘maiden name’ at all?Wed 14 Oct 2015 11.37 EDTLast modified on Wed 14 Oct 2015 11.53 EDTAn interesting debate was launched on Twitter when @KenSmith asked whether it was about time we dropped “maiden name” for the gender-neutral “birth name”. The tweet said: “Maiden has a ghostly cargo of Victorian sexual anxiety.”There was an overwhelming consensus that “maiden name” seems outdated at best and, for most people, sexist. A few comments:“Name before which marriage? I’ve been married, widowed and married again, keeping my own name always.” (@Bentonbag)“Archaic and inaccurate. I was most definitely not a ‘maiden’ when I married. Didn’t change my name either.” (@JemmaD)“The anglophone obsession with ‘maiden name’ is a window to the origin of marriage: trade of women for goods.” (@thisisredundant)“I’m always baffled when my bank asks me my mother’s maiden name. How presumptuous to assume she married or changed her name.” (@WilkinsonSamuel)Other people questioned the concept of changing one’s name on marriage at all as outdated. These days the husband sometimes takes the wife’s last name, or they double-barrel it. And with marriage equality, there may be two husbands or two wives, rendering the concept of a “maiden name” even more old-fashioned.My youngest son’s surname comprises my wife’s surname, followed by mine. If a bank ever asks his “mother’s maiden name”, it will be the first half of his own surname. Which doesn’t sound a very secure security question to me.Not everyone was comfortable with “birth name”. Alternative suggestions included “childhood name”, “native name”, “née”, and “original name” or “previous name” which, as @JonathanWest pointed out, “covers all cases of name change, not just to marriage and not just to birth name”.Among the few dissenting voices were those concerned that this attack on “maiden name” was a threat to maiden over and maiden century (in cricket), along with maiden voyage and similar figurative uses. I can’t see any reason why.I agree that “maiden name” is dated and sexist. I hope we can avoid it in the Guardian. Wikipedia favours the style “Jane Smith (born Jane Jones)” and this, when relevant, seems fair enough.It’s sexist to ask a woman (but not a man) her maiden name, or to ask anyone for their mother’s maiden name. It’s none of their business, just its none of their business to know whether a woman is married (“Mrs”) or not (“Miss”) unless she chooses to tell them.“Maiden name” does not take account of equal marriage – a male couple don’t have “maiden names”, a female couple have two, which are probably the names they actually use, so the whole thing becomes as dated as “spinster” or “bachelor girl” – or for that matter “confirmed bachelor” – now sound.It may be a while before we all agree on an alternative, if we ever do, but it seems likely that the phrase “maiden name” is on the way out. And about time too.TopicsLanguageMind your languageblogpostsReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedAustraliaCoronavirusWorldAU politicsEnvironmentFootballIndigenous AustraliaImmigrationMediaBusinessScienceTechNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top©2023Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Smith subsequently resigned fromthe Academyand was banned from attending all Academy functions, including the Oscars, for ten years.[14]Early lifeSmith was born and raised inPhiladelphiaas Willard Carroll Smith II on September 25, 1968,  to Caroline (née Bright), a school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith Sr.,[15][16]a US Air Force veteran[17]and refrigeration engineer. His mother graduated fromCarnegie Mellon University.[18]Smith grew up in West Philadelphia'sWynnefieldneighborhood[19]and was raisedBaptist.[20]He has an elder sister named Pamela and two younger siblings, twins Harry and Ellen.[19]He attended Our Lady of Lourdes, a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia,[21]andOverbrook High School.[22]His parents separated when he was 13[23]and divorced around the year 2000.[24]Smith began rapping at age 12. When his grandmother found a notebook of his lyrics, which he described as containing "all [his] little curse words", she wrote him a note on a page in the book: "Dear Willard, truly intelligent people do not have to use words like this to express themselves. Please show the world that you're as smart as we think you are". Smith said that this influenced his decision not to use profanity in his music.[25]CareerFurther information:Will Smith filmography,Will Smith discography, andList of awards and nominations received by Will Smith1985–1992: DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh PrinceSmith at the Emmy Awards 1993Smith started as theMCof the hip-hop duoDJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, with his childhood friendJeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townesasturntablistand producer.[26]Townes and Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smith's residence, and he was missing hishype man. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype man finally made it to the party.[27]Soon after, the two decided to join forces. Smith enlisted a friend to join as the beatboxer of the group, Clarence Holmes akaReady Rock C, making them a trio. Philadelphia-based Word Records released their first single in 1986 whenA&RmanPaul Oakenfold[28]introduced them to Champion Records with their single "Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble," a tale of funny misadventures that landed Smith and his former DJ and rap partner Mark Forrest (Lord Supreme) in trouble.[29]The song sampled the theme song of "I Dream of Jeannie." Smith became known for light-hearted story-telling raps and capable, though profanity-free, "battle" rhymes. The single became a hit a month before Smith graduated from high school.[30]Based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention ofJive RecordsandRussell Simmons. The duo's first album,Rock the House, which was first released on Word Up in 1986 debuted on Jive in March 1987. The group received the firstGrammy Award for Best Rap Performancein 1989 for "Parents Just Don't Understand" (1988), though their most successful single was "Summertime" (1991), which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on theBillboardHot 100. Smith and Townes are still friends and claim that they never split up, having made songs under Smith's solo performer credit.[31]Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes.[26]TheInternal Revenue Serviceeventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, andgarnishedhis income.[32]Smith was struggling financially in 1990 when theNBCtelevision network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him.[26]The show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming "the biggest movie star in the world", studyingbox office successes' common characteristics.[23]In 1989, Smith was arrested in relation to an alleged assault on his record promoter, William Hendricks; the charges were later dismissed.[33]1993–1997: Solo music and film breakthroughSmith's first major roles were in the dramaSix Degrees of Separation(1993) and the action filmBad Boys(1995) in which he starred oppositeMartin Lawrence.

The film was a massive blockbuster, becoming the second highest-grossing film in history at the time and establishing Smith as a prime box office draw.[36]In the summer of 1997, he starred alongsideTommy Lee Jonesin the hitMen in Black, playingAgent J. The film was released on July 2 byColumbia Picturesand grossed over $589.3 million worldwide against a $90 million budget, becoming the year's third highest-grossing film, with an estimated 54,616,700 tickets sold in the US.[37]It received positive reviews, with critics praising its humor, as well as Jones's and Smith's performances.During the summer of 1997, Smith also began his solo music career with the release of "Men in Black", the theme song for the film, which topped singles charts in several regions across the world, including the UK.[38]"Men in Black" (and second single "Just Cruisin'") was later included on Smith's debut solo albumBig Willie Style, which reached the top ten of the USBillboard200and was certified nine times platinum by theRecording Industry Association of America(RIAA).[39][40]The third single from the album, "Gettin' Jiggy wit It", became Smith's firstBillboardHot 100number one when it was released in 1998.[41]1998–2007: Leading man statusSmith in 1999In 1998, Smith starred withGene HackmaninEnemy of the State.[26]The following year he turned down the role ofNeoinThe Matrixin favor ofWild Wild West(1999). Despite the disappointment ofWild Wild West, Smith said that he has no regrets about his decision, asserting thatKeanu Reeves's performance as Neo was superior to what Smith himself would have achieved,[42]although in interviews subsequent to the release ofWild Wild Westhe said that he "made a mistake onWild Wild West. That could have been better."[43]Smith's second album was again supported by the release of a film theme song as the lead single: "Wild Wild West", featuringDru HillandKool Moe Dee, topped theBillboardHot 100 and was certified gold by the RIAA.[40][41]The album in question,Willennium, reached number five on theBillboard200 and was certified double platinum by the RIAA.[39][40]"Will 2K", the second single from the album, reached number 25 on theBillboardHot 100.[41]Before the end of 1999, a video album was released featuring Smith's seven music videos released to date,[44]which reached number 25 on theUK Music Video Chart.[45]The same year, he was also featured onThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Airco-starTatyana Ali's single "Boy You Knock Me Out", which reached number three on theUK Singles Chartand topped theUK R&B Singles Chart.[38][46]Smith portrayed heavyweight boxerMuhammad Aliin the 2001 biopicAli.

The film, along with Smith's performance, received praise.[51][52]Smith hosting the 2011 Walmart Shareholders MeetingOn December 10, 2007, Smith was honored atGrauman's Chinese TheatreonHollywood Boulevard. Smith left an imprint of his hands and feet outside the theater in front of many fans.[53]Later that month, Smith starred in the filmI Am Legend, released on December 14, 2007. Alongside marginally positive reviews,[54]its opening was the largest ever for a film released in the United States during December. Smith himself has said that he considers the film to be "aggressively unique".[55]A reviewer said that the film's commercial success "cemented [Smith's] standing as the number one box office draw in Hollywood."[56]On December 1, 2008,TV Guidereported that Smith was selected as one of America's top ten most fascinating people of 2008 for aBarbara WaltersABCspecial that aired on December 4, 2008.[57]2008–2019: Blockbusters and critical disappointmentsIn 2008, Smith was reported to be developing a film entitledThe Last Pharaoh, in which he would be starring asTaharqa.[58]Smith later starred in the superhero movieHancock,[59]which grossed $227,946,274 in the United States and Canada and had a worldwide total of $624,386,746.[60]On August 19, 2011, it was announced that Smith returned to the studio with producer La Mar Edwards to work on his fifth studio album.[61]Smith again reprised his role as Agent J withMen in Black 3, which opened on May 25, 2012, his first major starring role in four years.[62][63]After the release of the film, Smith was content with ending his work with the franchise, saying, "I think three is enough for me. Three of anything is enough for me. We'll look at it and we'll consider it, but it feels like that it might be time to let someone else do that."[64]Men in Black 3, released ten years afterMen in Black II(2002), grossed over $624 million worldwide.[65][66]Unadjusted for inflation, it is the highest-grossing film in the series.[67][68]In 2013, Smith starred inAfter Earthwith his son Jaden. The film was a disappointment at the domestic box office and was panned critically.[69]Calling the film "the most painful failure in my career", Smith ended up taking a year and a half break as a result.[70]Smith andSuicide Squadco-starMargot Robbiein 2016Smith starred oppositeMargot Robbiein the romance dramaFocus, released on February 27, 2015.[71]He played Nicky Spurgeon, a veteran con artist who takes a young, attractive woman under his wing. Smith was set to star in the sci-fi thrillerBrilliance, an adaptation ofMarcus Sakey's novel of the same name scripted byJurassic ParkwriterDavid Koepp, but he left the project to work on theRidley Scott-produced sports dramaConcussion.[72][73]InConcussion, Smith played Dr.Bennet Omaluof theBrain Injury Research Institute, the first to discoverchronic traumatic encephalopathy. Smith reported he had doubts about the film early in the production, saying, "some of my happiest memories are of watching my son catch and throw a football. I didn't want to be the guy who did a movie saying football could be dangerous." These views subsided when he met Omalu, whose words about American ideals resonated with Smith.[74]Smith's performance was praised for being "sensitive [and] understated".[75]In 2016, Smith playedDeadshotin the supervillain team-up action filmSuicide Squad.[76]Smith's participation in the film meant choosing it over a role inIndependence Day: Resurgence, which he said would be like "clinging and clawing backwards."[77]WhileSuicide Squadwas a massive financial success, earning over $700 million at the box office, the film received negative reviews from critics. Christopher Orr, film critic fromThe Atlanticdescribed the film writing "The latest offering from the DC Comics superhero universe may be the most disastrous yet".[78]Later that year, Smith starred in directorDavid Frankel's dramaCollateral Beauty, playing a New York advertising executive who succumbs to a deep depression after a personal tragedy.[79]Weeks after signing Smith onto the film, his father was diagnosed with cancer, from which he died in 2016.[80]As part of his role required him to read about religion and the afterlife, he was brought closer to the elder Smith, calling the experience "a beautiful way to prepare for a movie and an even more majestic way to say goodbye to my father."[81]The film marked the lowest box office opening of Will Smith's career.[82]The film also received near universal negative acclaim from film critics.[83]Hollywood Reportercritic David Rooney criticized Smith's performance writing as "the least interesting component in a madly overqualified cast".[84]His filmBrightwas distributed via Netflix on December 22, 2017. An urban fantasy, it was the most expensive film for Netflix to date. Smith collaborated with his director fromSuicide Squad,David Ayer.[85]That month, Smith launched his own YouTube channel, which as of July 2019[update]has over 6 million subscribers and 294 million total views.[86]Also in 2017, Smith released the song "Get Lit" a collaboration between him and his former group mate Jazzy Jeff.[87][88]This would also be another critical disappointment for Smith, with critics panning the movie.Richard RoeperofThe Chicago Sun-Timescriticized the film and Smith's performance writing, "By the time Will Smith barks [the line, "Dude, you can't go through elf town!"] with 100 percent urgency and sincerity in the mindboggling mess that is "Bright," it's clear we are watching a truly terrible, mountainous pile of genre-blending garbage."[89]Smith performed the soccer2018 World Cup's official song "Live It Up"Smith performed the official song "Live It Up" alongside American singerNicky Jamand Kosovar singerEra Istrefiat the closing ceremony of the2018 FIFA World Cupin Moscow, Russia.[90]That September, Smith appeared, alongsideBad Bunny, on theMarc Anthonysong "Está Rico".[91]Smith portrayedThe Genie(originally voiced byRobin Williams) in thelive-action adaptationof Disney'sAladdin, directed byGuy Ritchie.

At least, that's been the excuse, although judging by the finished product, it was the script that never lived up to the promise of its premise."[97]Later that year, Smith had his second starring role in an animated film, inSpies in Disguise, oppositeTom Holland. Smith voiced Lance Sterling, a spy who teams up with the nerdy inventor who creates his gadgets (Holland).[98]In 2020, he reteamed with Martin Lawrence for the third film in their franchise,Bad Boys for Life. In 2019, Smith invested $46 million in esports organizationGen.Gwith Smith's Dreamers Fund, which he co-founded withKeisuke Honda.[99]In June 2020, it was announced that Smith would star inEmancipation, directed byAntoine Fuqua, in which he portrays Peter, a runaway slave, who outsmarts hunters and the Louisiana swamp on a journey to theUnion Army.[100]2020–present: Memoir andKing RichardSmith's memoirWill, which was written withMark Manson, the author ofThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,was published on November 9, 2021, and promoted with a tour.[101][102]The book is a journey of self-knowledge recalling childhood traumas, his relationship with his father, and his experiences withayahuasca.[103][104]In the same year, he and his Westbrook Studios company signed a deal withNational Geographic.[105]Smith portrayedRichard Williams, father and coach of tennis playersVenusandSerena Williams, in the 2021 filmKing Richard.

Educational methodologies used by the school includeStudy Technology,Montessori education,Gardner, andBrunermethods.The school closed on June 28, 2013.[1]Funding[edit]The school's campus was formerly used byIndian Hills High School,[2]which relocated toAgoura High SchoolinAgoura Hills, Californiato save money.[3]In 2008, actorWill SmithpaidUS$890,000 to lease the Calabasas campus for three years, restructuring it from a high school to a private elementary school called New Village Academy.[2]The school is located close to Will Smith's home in Calabasas.[4]Prior to New Village Academy, Smith and Pinkett Smith's two children were home-schooled by their mother.[5]The school was founded by the Smiths, who say they are not Scientologists, in 2005 as a home school for their younger children and those of several other families.[6]Smith and his wife installed their current director ofphilanthropy, Jana Babatunde-Bey, as the executive director of the school and Jacqueline Olivier as Head of School.[6]In an appearance onLive with Regis and KellyWill Smith commented on the educational methodologies used by the school: "There are just very powerful educational concepts that we believe in, and we feel like we want to design the system that revolutionizes public education."[7]"New Village Academy was born of a simple question, 'Is it possible to create an educational environment in which children have fun learning?' Jada and I believe the answer is 'Yes.'", said Smith in a released statement.[8][9]A spokesperson for Will Smith toldThe Guardian: "Will is leasing the campus for three years, plus he'll cover all costs such as utilities. The academy will be run privately, and will includepre-kindergartenthrough grade six."[10]New Village Academy's Calabasas facilities opened in 2008.[11][12]In March 2009 theAssociated Pressreported that Jada Pinkett-Smith planned to open a companion high-school.[13]Federal tax filing showed that Will Smith donated $1.2 million to the school in 2010.[14]Teaching and staff[edit]Educational methodologies used by the school includedMontessori,Gardner,Jerome Bruner, andStudy Technology.[6]Subjects included in the school's curriculum includemathematics,literacy,Spanish,karate,yoga,robotics,technology,etiquette,art, and living skills.[6][9]New Village Academy served organic meals to students, and laptops were made available to all students.[5]The school encouraged parental involvement and restricted access to television.[6]Tuition was approximately $22,500 per year to attend the school,[15]and 80% of the students would receive financial assistance.[16]Scientology ties[edit]Tom CruiseandKatie Holmes' daughter Suri attended the school from 2009[17]The staff includes a number ofScientologists, including the Director of Learning, Director of Qualifications and artistic director,[5]as well as some of the school's teachers.[18]New Village Academy's Director of Learning, formerly the director of HELP inBoston, graduated from the ScientologyDelphi SchoolinMilton, Massachusetts.[5]The school's website lists "Study Technology", a form of education developed byChurch of ScientologyfounderL. Ron Hubbard,[19]as one of its methodologies.[5]The website utilizesScientology terminologyincluding "spiraling" and "gradient" in order to illustrate how students learn in the school's programs.[5]The school's motto "Spiral Up" has been compared to Scientology's term "dwindling spiral", when "one commits overt acts unwittingly",[20]although "spiral curriculum" is also a term associated withJerome Bruner.[21]When a student needs to be disciplined they are taken to the "ethics teacher".[10]Jada Pinkett Smith toldABC News, "Study Technology is a secular methodology intended to help students better understand what is being studied and apply it to real life. NVLA integrates this methodology as a tool in instructional design by providing teachers the framework to design lessons and curriculum."[22]In response to reports of Scientology ties in 2008, Jacqueline Olivier who was administrator at the time, denied that the school had a religious affiliation, and told theLos Angeles Times: "People tend to think Study Technology is a subject, but it is really just the way the subject is taught. They then come to the conclusion that we are teaching Scientology when actually a methodology doesn't have anything to do with content."[6]Olivier was appointed administrator at the school in 2007, her duties have included hiring all teachers since that time.[23]She said that in addition to Scientologists the school also hasMuslim,ChristianandJewishstaff members,[6]and said: "We are a secular school."[24]"Faculty and staff do not promote their own religions at school."[25]Children from all religious backgrounds will be accepted at the school.[8]Professor ofcomputer scienceatCarnegie Mellon Universityand Scientology criticDavid S. Touretzkywas critical of the school's use of Study Technology, and told theLos Angeles Times: "There is no reputable educator anywhere who endorsesStudy Technology. What happens is that children are inculcated with Scientology jargon and are led to regard L.R. Hubbard as an authority figure. They are laying the groundwork for later bringing people into Scientology."[6]Touretzky maintains a website critical of Study Technology, and told theLos Angeles Timesthat the terms "Director of Qualifications" and the school's "Qual" department refer to those tested by a Church of Scientology qualifications teacher in a ScientologyAuditingsession.[6]Karin Pouw, Scientology spokeswoman and director of public affairs forChurch of Scientology International,[26]disputed Touretzky's statements and asserted to theLos Angeles Timesthat Study Tech is not a religious methodology and is used in schools internationally.[6]In early September 2008 members of the anti-Scientology groupProject Chanologyprotested outside of New Village Academy and objected to their claims that L. Ron Hubbard techniques were being used in the school.[27]In July 2009, Olivier and several of the teachers resigned from their posts for undisclosed reasons.[28]Olivier was replaced by Piano Foster, an educator with Scientology associations; Foster began at the school on July 1, 2009.[29]Piano Foster has participated in Scientology courses.[30][31]Foster completed the Scientology class, Basic Study Manual, at the Scientology Celebrity Center in 2005.[22]Olivier was let go from herUS$200,000 position, due to disagreements over teaching methodologies to utilize at the school.[32]A representative for Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith told theNew York Post, "Jacquie is no longer at the school for reasons entirely unrelated to curriculum. She is an excellent educator and fully embraced the school's secular and open-minded approach to innovative teaching methodologies."[30]TheNew York Postreported that Olivier left the school due to conflicts with the Smiths over the Scientology "Study Tech" teaching methodologies.[30]Foster confirmed she had been placed as the new administrator for the school, and stated, "I officially took over on July 1, 2009, and I'm looking forward to the challenge. I feel I'm ready for the job."[33]Suri Cruisebegan attending in April 2009.[17]According to the Smiths, the school has no religious affiliation.[34]See also[edit]Greater Los Angeles portalSchools portalDelphi SchoolsGreenfields SchoolMace-Kingsley Ranch SchoolWorld Literacy CrusadeReferences[edit]^Ortega, Tony (July 3, 2013)."Will Smith-Backed School That Used Scientology Materials Closes Its Doors".The Underground Bunker.

What Goes on Inside Will Smith, Jada Pinkett-Smith's School?  - ABC NewsABC NewsVideoLiveShowsGuns in AmericaInterest Successfully AddedWe'll notify you here with news aboutTurn on desktop notifications for breaking stories about interest?OffOnLOG INStream onWhat Goes on Inside Will Smith, Jada Pinkett-Smith's School?Smith, Jada Pinkett-Smith's New Village Leadership Academy stirs curiosity.ByHEATHER DOWNIESeptember 8, 2009, 4:48 PMSept. 11, 2009 &#151; --Like many modern celebrity power couples,Will SmithandJada Pinkett-Smithare not satisfied with just being actors.The couple, who met on the set of "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" in 1995, have had a lot of different roles over the years, most recently founding the New Village Leadership Academy (NVLA), a private elementary school in Calabasas, Calif., which opened its doors this week for the start of the 2009-10 school year.But asOprah Winfreyfamously discovered when she startedThe Leadership Academy School for Girls, for celebrities, getting involved in an educational venture can be a road fraught with controversy.Coupled with the long-time "secretlyScientologist" rumors that have surrounded the Smiths, the school's opening has attracted curiosity.While they're close friends with actorsTom CruiseandKatie Holmes, arguably the world's most famous Scientology couple, Smith has said that he is a not a member of the church."I've talked to Tom about it. [There's] lots of incredible, wonderful concepts [but my wife] Jada and I don't necessarily believe in organized religion. I was raised in a Baptist household, and my grandmother would get up out of her casket [if I became a Scientologist]," Smith told the World Entertainment News Network, a news wire, in 2006.Also creating questions are reports that tax returns for 2008 from the Smith's charitable foundation show that the couple gave a combined $122,500 in donations to groups affiliated with the Church of Scientology.The Smiths reportedly donated a total of $1.3 million to a variety of religious, civic and arts groups that year. Smith's biggest single contribution was to Yesha Ministries of Philadelphia. He gave the Christian-based organization run by the Rev. James Robinson $250,000. Another $200,000 went to a Christian ministry in Los Angeles called "Living Waters." The foundation also donated to a Los Angeles mosque, as well as the Yitzhak Rabin Memorial Center and other religious groups.  When asked about the donations, Will Smith's publicist, Pat Kinsley, told ABC News.com that her client doesn't comment on his philanthropic work.In an interview with Ebony magazine earlier this year, Pinkett-Smith said that the NVLA was not tied to Scientology: "All I can say is it is not a Scientology school," she told the magazine. "Now, If you don't trust me, and you are questioning my integrity, that's a whole different matter. That is straight evil to think that I would bring families into that educational institution and then try to get them to convert into some religion."Despite such statements, skeptics continue to raise questions about whether the Smiths have ties to Scientology, especially when it comes to the NVLA.The suspicions stem largely from the NVLA's use of Study Technology, a teaching methodology developed byL. Ron Hubbard, the founder of theChurch of Scientology.It operates under the assumption that there are three "barriers" to learning that children must identify and overcome.Critics claim Study Technology is repackaged Scientology. One professor who has closely followed Scientology suggested the "three barriers" technique is used as a means of familiarizing children with some of the vocabulary often used in Scientology teachings, and several educators told ABCNews.com that the "three barriers" philosophy is a fundamentally flawed teaching tool.But proponents of the method like the Smiths and Applied Scholastics, the organization founded in 1972 to make Study Tech broadly available, say it's an effective, nonreligious teaching technique."Study Technology is a secular methodology intended to help students better understand what is being studied and apply it to real life," Pinkett-Smith wrote in an e-mail to ABCNews.com forwarded through her publicist. "NVLA integrates this methodology as a tool in instructional design by providing teachers the framework to design lessons and curriculum."In a March interview with National Public Radio, Pinkett-Smith spoke about the school's alleged religious ties."I definitely want to make it very clear to everybody that the educational institution that we have, the school that Will and I have, is not a Scientology school ... it is not a desire of ours to educate children with Scientology, that is not what Will and I want to do.  And our school is not, and I repeat, not a Scientology school."The most ardent critic of Study Technology says he doesn't buy all the denials.  Dave S. Touretzky, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, created a Web site that dissects Study Tech and asserts that it is the Scientology religion disguised as education.Touretzky said he became focused on Scientology after the group threatened to sue Carnegie Mellon and himself after he posted a secret document revealing what he called the organization's "creation myth.""I can't say it [the school] is aScientologychurch," he told ABCNews.com. "What they seem to have is some sort of a hybrid. Scientology repackaged for the Hollywood crowd. It's hitting all the politically correct elements ... but snuck in there is this Scientology stuff."A spokeswoman for the Church ofScientology, Karin Pouw, would not comment on whether there was a relationship between Scientology and the NVLA. She referred all questions back to the school.Other educators worry less about Study Technology's ties to Scientology and more about its overall effectiveness."I look at the Study Tech ideas and it doesn't seem sound educationally," said Jim McManus, executive director of the California Association of Independent Schools.  He spent 14 years as an education consultant for independent schools around the country and says he has no personal animosity toward Scientology.Dan Willingham, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia who has a background as a cognitive scientist and wrote the book "Why Don't Students Like School," has similar doubts about Study Technology's merits and says it is based on flawed theories."It's perfectly possible that the methodology is based on ridiculous principles and that something effective is happening in the classroom, but ridiculous principles certainly lowers that possibility," Willingham said.The New Village Leadership AcademyLocated in the city of Calabasas, just outside of Los Angeles, the New Village Leadership Academy is nestled alongside a main road and surrounded by palm trees and housing developments.The NVLA opened its doors Sept. 3, 2008, after the Smiths paid nearly $1 million to lease the Indian Hills High School campus in the Las Virgines Unified School District for three years.Like many private schools in L.A., NVLA students pay annual tuitions of up to $12,500. In return, says its Web site, students get "a mix of traditional and progressive teaching methodologies." Students take classes in yoga, robotics, etiquette, Spanish and karate, and are fed organic, non-sugary foods.Two of the school's fewer than 100 students are the Smith's previously home-schooled children -- Jaden,10, and Willow, 8.The NVLA's Web site calls the school "an optimum learning environment -- an ideal model to be shared with all people of the world."Not everyone agrees.Project Chanology, an Internet-based anti-Scientology group, protested the school's opening, calling the private academy a "front" for the Church of Scientology and picketed on the sidewalk in front of the school, carrying signs with messages reading, "Study Tech exploits children for profit."While no one from the group responded to e-mails from ABCNews.com, a press release sent Sept. 8, 2008, said their primary concern is that all schools using Study Tech must pay licensing fees to the Church of Scientology: "This revenue stream is one of the many sources of income which the Church of Scientology uses for such tactics as invoking frivolous lawsuits and hiring private investigators to intimidate critics."The release went on to say that Smith met with the organization during the protests and said he was "not a Scientologist," but was "unable to definitively say that NVLA is making no payments to Scientology." He then explained "he does not wish to pay a fee to anyone because of his desire to maintain complete control over the teaching methods used at NVLA, an option not typically offered to licensees of Scientology Technology," according to the release.When asked if NVLA pays a licensing fee for Study Tech to the Church of Scientology, Will Smith's publicist, Pat Kingsley, replied, "no," in an e-mail to ABCNews.comThe Church of Scientology believes Project Chanology has ties to an organization called Anonymous, a group that organizes mostly online protests and has a longstanding opposition to Scientology. The church released a statement earlier in 2008 in anticipation of a Project Chanology protest, alleging that the group had targeted Scientology based on "religious bigotry.""As to our knowledge of the organizers of the event, they are cyberterrorists who hide their identities behind masks and computer anonymity," read the statement, which was posted on the St. Petersburg Times Web site. "'Anonymous'" is perpetrating religious hate crimes against churches of Scientology and individual Scientologists for no reason other than religious bigotry."Scientology dates back to the 1950s, when it was created by Hubbard, a science fiction writer. Hubbard believed people were spiritual beings, or Thetans, whose minds stored mental images beyond a person's control. Through spiritual counseling called "auditing," Hubbard taught that a person could solve personal problems by locating these images and addressing them.Since its founding, Scientology has received its fair share of media criticism and has come under fire for lambasting psychiatry. One of the most memorable examples was Cruise's chastising of actress Brooke Shields for using anti-depressants to treat postpartum depression. Cruise later apologized to Shields for being critical.Citing the controversial aspects of Scientology as troubling, critics have been quick to point out that the NVLA school employs people who have taken Scientology courses.In July, Jacqueline Olivier was removed from her position as head of the pre-kindergarten through grade six school and replaced by Piano Foster, who completed a Scientology basic study manual course at the Scientology Celebrity Center in 2005, according to TruthAboutScientology.com, a database run by Kristi Wachter that tracks Scientology members.Olivier refused to comment on the removal, saying, "As a former head of the school, it's just not one of those things you do. You keep it professional."When asked by ABCNews.com whether she didn't want to be interviewed because she had signed a confidentiality agreement, Olivier responded, "Yes and no." She then declined to discuss her religious affiliations.While the Smiths and their publicists chose not to comment on the reason behind Olivier's firing, a rep for the Smiths told the New York Post's Page Six, "Jacquie is no longer at the school for reasons entirely unrelated to curriculum." The Smith's spokeswoman also described Foster as a Catholic, not a Scientologist.In June 2008, Olivier told the Los Angeles Times, "We are a secular school, and just like all nonreligious independent schools, faculty and staff do not promote their own religions at school or pass on the beliefs of their particular faith to children."  She also said the school would use many philosophies, including Montessori, Bruner and Gardner.NVLA Faculty's Scientology TiesWachter, who started the TruthAboutScientology.com Web site to gauge whether the number ofScientologistswas growing, says she gets her data from three Scientology magazines -- Freewinds, Celebrity and Auditor, which Wachter collects from former Scientology members.  All three publish Scientology course completion data.According to Wachter's Web site, the NVLA's artistic director, Sisu Raiken, and director of learning, Tasia Jones, have also taken Scientology courses.  Wachter says Raiken enrolled in 16 courses and Jones completed six between 2000 and 2006.Raiken and Jones also appear to host Web sites through the Church of Scientology.  The banners on these sites read: "I am a Scientologist, Support Religious Tolerance."Raiken's page says: "I have studied many courses inScientologyover the past 16 years, done the Purification Rundown to rid my body of toxins and drugs, and also been involved in many of the social outreach programs of Scientology, mainly getting Mr. Hubbard's literacy program known and put into use."Jones' site says: "I am currently teaching in a small private school" and included a link to the Applied Scholastics Web site.The Scientology Celebrity Center in Hollywood where Foster, Raiken and Jones reportedly took courses said it was not their policy to reveal personal information, and Raiken and Jones did not respond to phone calls asking for comment.By far, the most controversial aspect of the NVLA is its use of the Study Technology teaching methodology."People tend to think Study Technology is a subject, but it is really just the way the subject is taught. They then come to the conclusion that we are teaching Scientology when actually a methodology doesn't have anything to do with content," Olivier told the Los Angeles Times.The three barriers to learning are outlined in five textbooks for kids: Basic Study Manual, Study Skills for Life, Learning How to Learn, How to Use a Dictionary and Grammar and Communication for Children.The first barrier is called a "lack of mass," which means students need to gain hands-on experience to understand a concept.  "Lacking the object associated with a word can inhibit all understanding," explains the Applied Scholastics Web site.The second barrier is a concept called "too steep a gradient," requiring that students master a subject matter before moving on to more advanced concepts.The third is called "misunderstood words," in which students are taught to go back to look up words in a dictionary if they do not understand a concept.  "Stupidity is the effect of misunderstood words," according to ScientologyHandbook.org.The process of looking up misunderstood words is called "word clearing," a six-step procedure that begins with looking up the word in a dictionary and using each of its definitions in several example sentences.The three barriers to learning are accompanied by physiological responses, according to Study Technology.  A student who has skipped a gradient may feel a sort of confusion or a feeling of reeling, such as moving or swaying like you might fall, according to the Applied Scholastics Web site.  The books Learning How to Learn and the Basic Study Manual teach that misunderstood words cause symptoms like feeling blank, tired, worried, upset, "like you are not there", or suffering "a sort of nervous hysteria."Touretzky warned that by teaching kids words like "mass," "clear" and "gradients" that are scattered throughout Church of Scientology literature, the implementation of Study Tech is a way of slipping in Scientology through the back door."Study Tech is one of several paths the church pursues to insinuate Scientology into civilized society," he said.According to the Applied Scholastics Web site, Study Technology has reached 28 million children at 650 centers and schools in more than 65 countries.Eight of those students attended Prescott Middle School in Baton Rouge, La.,  During the 2005-2006 school year, Study Tech was used to "salvage a group of 8th grade students, who might not otherwise be qualified to enter high school at the end of the school year," according to the Web site.All eight passed the Louisiana Education Assessment Program standardized exam and entered 9th grade, according to Diola Bagayoko, a professor of physics at Southern University who partnered with Prescott to develop the school's curriculum, which included Study Tech.He said the use of Study Tech was a last ditch effort before Prescott was taken over for failing to perform.  He said he thoroughly investigated Study Tech before it was implemented and was pleased with the results.He told ABCNews.com that the methodology is "very effective" and based on sound principles.Bagayoko, who is not a Scientologist, said Scientology was never mentioned during the two years it was administered at Prescott.  "There was not a single occurrence of Scientology ever being pushed.  I'm emphatic about it."  He said the kids didn't even know who L. Ron Hubbard was.He admitted, however, that the program ended after two years because of negative media attention focused on the ties between Study Tech and Scientology."I should note that most teachers belong to a religion, and most textbooks and educational policies are developed by individuals who belong to a religion," Bagayoko said.Study Technology as a Teaching ToolWhile the educators ABCNews.com reached  were not familiar with the ties between Study Technology and Scientology, they believe the methodology's barrier theories are flawed."Lack of mass doesn't make very much sense at all," said Willingham. "It seems to imply it's almost impossible to learn anything by reading or by listening, when obviously that's most of what we do."He added that the data on "manipulables" is much more mixed than people think. "People think kids need to have concrete objects to manipulate.  It's more complicated than that.  Sometimes it helps and sometimes it hinders learning to have concrete physical objects."McManus takes issue with the second barrier -- too steep a gradient.  "The whole thing with gradients suggests that there is only one sequential pattern that any kid can use to learn something," he said. "Some kids will move from point G to point M, then get to Z.  Some will skip the whole notion that there is only one sequence of thinking.  Almost anyone that has spent any time in the classroom knows it just doesn't ring true."Stephen A. Kent, a professor of sociology and religious studies at the University of Alberta who has spoken out against Scientology in the past, finds flaws with the way Study Technology handles learning disabilities."Scientology believes that these three techniques can overcome students' learning problems. The program excludes, however, any appreciation of medical or biochemical issues within children which may cause or contribute to learning disabilities."Kent said Scientologists believe these techniques can overcome dyslexia, for instance, but don't advocate kids taking Ritalin and other learning disability drugs for other conditions.Applied Scholastics did not respond to an ABCNews.com request for comment, but the organization's Web site features several stories championing children learning without the use of drugs.The Web site offered other claims about the technique's effectiveness:"In Los Angeles, Calif., students at a school which uses Study Technology throughout its curriculum regularly score 30 percent above the national average on pre-college aptitude tests," according to the Applied Scholastic Web site. "Their 4th grade students consistently score to more grade levels above the norm in reading, math and language on standardized achievement tests."When asked for specific information about successes from the use of Study Technology, a spokesperson wrote in an e-mail that questions could be answered on the Web site.Willingham says he is a man who appreciates data.  "Unless I'm missing something, there is almost no info here [on the Web site] at all to tell you how these studies were actually done.  Those are the details that actually matter."On his Web site, Touretzky writes that Study Tech's promoters are "remarkably vague about its results.  Applied Scholastics and its related organizations have publicized some claimed successes, but have provided no specifics, corroboration or even details of where the results were obtained."He believes schools that use Study Tech are trying to putting a positive face on L. Ron Hubbard's teachings.ABCNews.com was unable to reach students at NVLA, or their parents."I definitely want to make it very clear to everybody that the educational institution that we have, the school that Will and I have, is not a Scientology school," Pinkett-Smith told NPR. "I know there's been ... a lot of buzz around that idea and that it is not my desire to ... teach Scientology at all."I definitely respect and understand people's curiosity, you know, and well, people, they have to trust me when I speak on my truth.  That's really the bottom line."Top StoriesMost leading Republicans remain quiet on abortion pill ruling as Dems blast decisionApr 11, 3:04 PMLouisville shooting updates: Dramatic body camera footage released1 hour agoChina 'ready to fight' after 3 days of large-scale military drills around TaiwanApr 11, 10:23 AMJudge, Fox attorney clash over TV hosts' testimony in Dominion defamation caseApr 11, 2:11 PMOver 2,000 residents ordered to evacuate after fire ignites at recycling plantApr 11, 8:09 PMABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContact UsCopyright Â©2023ABC News Internet Ventures.

During a recent appearance on Live With Regis & Kelly, Smith didn’t share many details about the school but said that he was inspired from his family’s experiences with education.“We started homeschooling our children probably six years ago,” he said. “We found about eight or nine other parents that homeschool, so we put the children together…. There are just very powerful educational concepts that we believe in, and we feel like we want to design the system that revolutionizes public education.”Once the home of a continuing education high school, the academy plans to open its doors on September 3 to welcome prekindergarten through sixth grade students, according to its Web site. Each student will be provided with a laptop as well as all-organic, low-fat, sugar-free meals. The academy offers competitive tuitions and financial aid for eligible families. In 2005, Jada Pinkett Smith told ESSENCE: “The school system in this country—public and private—is designed for the industrial age. We’re in a technological age. We don’t want our kids to memorize. We want them to learn.”Photo Credit: Charley Gallay/Getty Images for EssenceCOMPANY INFORMATIONOur CompanyCustomer ServiceEssence VenturesChange Your AddressContact UsJob OpportunitiesInternshipsMedia KitSUBSCRIBENewslettersGive a Gift of ESSENCEMagazine Tablet EditionFOLLOW USMORE ON ESSENCEHomeLoveCelebrityBeautyHairFashionESSENCE festivalESSENCE.com is part of ESSENCE Communications, Inc.Essence may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.

And so, in October 2018, Hollywood superstar Will Smith joined his wife,Jada Pinkett Smith, for a special two-part episode of her Facebook Watch seriesRed Table Talk.One year prior, The Daily Beast had published aninterview with Leah Remini, the ex-Scientologist turned whistleblower who alleged that Pinkett Smith was a devoted practitioner of Scientology—a costly endeavor (reaching its highest “Operating Thetan” levels can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars) that comprises tales of intergalactic overlords, dead alien souls, “body thetans,” and the curious theory that humans evolved from clams.“I know Jada’s in. I know Jada’s in. She’s been in Scientology a long time,” Remini told me. “I never saw Will [Smith] there, but I saw Jada at the Celebrity Centre. They opened up a Scientology school, and have since closed it. But Jada, I had seen her at the Scientology Celebrity Centre all the time.”Remini was referring tothe Scientology Celebrity Centre in Hollywood, California, where its handful of famous acolytes take courses along the “Bridge to Total Freedom.” TheKing of Queensstar’s claim prompted Will to clear the air.“All right, so hold on—let’s clear some rumors, just to have it on record,” offered Will that day onRed Table Talk. “We’ve never been Scientologists, we’ve never been swingers.”A little over a week ago, the couple confessed—interribly awkward fashion—that the “swingers” portion of that statement was misleading at best. As for the “Scientologists” part, well, that doesn’t appear to be entirely true either. (The Smiths and the Church of Scientology did not respond to numerous requests for comment.)According to Tony Ortega, the world’s leading Scientology reporter and publisher ofThe Underground Bunker, while the Smiths aren’t currently involved with the controversial religion, Pinkett Smith has “definitely been misleading about her past involvement” in Scientology. “I talked to close friends of Will Smith who said he was a ‘dabbler’ who dabbled in everything, and that Jada was thehardcoreScientologist.”And nowhere was that influence more apparent than at the New Village Leadership Academy, the Smiths’ mysterious private school in tony Calabasas, California, that opened its doors in 2008 before quietly closing in 2013.The Daily Beast spoke to four former teachers and administrators at the New Village Leadership Academy who insist that Scientology not only bled into every aspect of the school but that it was “essentially a Scientology school,” filled with mostly Scientologist-teachers that taught students Scientology methods of learning.AdvertisementThe New Village Leadership Academy began as a home school in one of the Smiths’ unused residences in Indian Hills, California.“Will and Jada gathered 20, 30 kids—including their kids, Jaden and Willow—in their old home. It was a big house where they had several rooms, almost like a Montessori,” says Mariappan Jawaharlal, Ph.D., who goes by the nickname “Jawa.”Jawaharlal, who currently serves as an engineering professor at California State University, Sacramento, is one of the leading robotics instructors in the country, and was recruited by Jacqueline Olivier to be a guest-lecturer for the Smiths’ budding school. Olivier had previously run the Gillispie School in La Jolla, California, and was hired by the Smiths to help found and oversee the New Village Leadership Academy.“Theynevermentioned Scientology,” Olivier tells me. “But I remember they sent me the L. Ron Hubbard books [the founder of Scientology], and I didn’t put it together. It just seemed like a great opportunity.”There were other signs. Olivier says she soon discovered that all of the teachers in the Smiths’ home were Scientologists, and remembers Pinkett Smith ordering her to take classes in “study technology”—a dubious teaching method developed by Hubbard that is foundational to Scientology.Will and Jada Pinkett Smith's New Village Leadership Academy.AlamyAdvertisementThe New Village Leadership Academy’s website, which has since been removed, did not contain any mention of Scientology but did provide an explainer of study technology, which it described as: “An educational model developed by L R Hubbard, study technology focuses on three principles. First is the use of ‘mass’ (manipulatives and hands-on experiences) to foster understanding—children need to see and feel what they are learning about. Second is the attention to the ‘gradient,’ which ensures students master one level before moving on to the next. Third is the ‘misunderstood word,’ in which students master word definitions and are taught not to read past words they don’t know the meanings of in order to understand completely what they are reading and learning. NVA uses study technology as an umbrella methodology woven through the subjects.” (The practice of understanding the “misunderstood word” is known as “word clearing.”)“Will would say, ‘It has to be 100 percent study technology.’ And I later learned that you couldn’t have it less than that, because it’s a holy thing,” says Olivier. “And Jada said, ‘If you’re the person in charge of the school then you need to be the person who knows the most about study technology, so we need you to take these courses.’”Olivier says she and other teachers were made to take courses at Scientology’s Celebrity Centre in Hollywood, California, and also at Applied Scholastics, a Scientology-affiliated group that promotes study technology.“We all went to Applied Scholastics,” says Olivier. “They have all these front companies that you only realize later are Scientology.”“I had to go down to the Celebrity Centre and do stuff with theE-meter, and Jada was always at the Celebrity Centre,” she continues. “My feeling is that Jada was really into [Scientology] and Will was sort of whatever… but he took all the courses too.”But Olivier says that Smith was pressured to downplay—at least publicly—his involvement in the Church of Scientology. She recalls attending a meeting at the Smiths’ home wherein James Lassiter, who runs Smith’s production shingle Overbrook Entertainment, warned Smith, “Don’t let this Scientology shit get in the way ofHancock”—Overbrook’s big 2008 summer movie release starring Smith as a slovenly superhero. (Lassiter did not respond to requests for comment.)Advertisement“She recalls attending a meeting at the Smiths’ home wherein James Lassiter, who runs Smith’s production shingle Overbrook Entertainment, warned Smith, “Don’t let this Scientology shit get in the way of ‘Hancock’...”The 2008 tax returns for the Smiths’ charitable foundation, the Will & Jada Smith Family Foundation, showed that the pair gave a total of $122,500 to Scientology groups, including Applied Scholastics and its umbrella organization, the Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE).“I was naïve about it,” offers Olivier. “I take things at face value and believe people—and they’re actors. And that’s how they lured people into Scientology.”In 2008, the Smiths paid $890,000 for a three-year lease to a building that formerly housed Indian Hills High School—a place best known for educating five of the seven members of the “Bling Ring,” a gang of teens who robbed celebrity homes in Calabasas.And Olivier was admittedly excited at the prospect of helping found a school that provided educational opportunities for underprivileged kids, from pre-K to sixth grade.Advertisement“I really wanted to start a school, and was very into social justice and diversity, giving opportunities to kids,” explains Oliver, noting that 80 percent of the students at New Village Leadership Academy received some form of financial aid, and most of the student body was Black.Plus, both privately and publicly, the Smiths repeatedly maintained that New Village Leadership Academy was a secular, non-religious school that merely employed study technology.“All I can say is it is not a Scientology school,” Pinkett Smith toldEbonymagazine in 2009. “Now, if you don’t trust me, and you are questioning my integrity, that’s a whole different matter. That is straight evil to think that I would bring families into that educational institution and then try to get them to convert into some religion.”Former teachers and administrators who spoke to The Daily Beast dispute this characterization.“They had this course supervisor who had her own Scientology charges, and so I hired a bunch of people who weren’t Scientologists,” says Olivier. “Everyone else there were Scientologists.”She adds, “There were pictures of L. Ron Hubbard on the walls. And in the study technology book, there was a picture of [Hubbard] and a whole mini-biography of his life, and that was thefirst thing[kids] had to word clear—before anything. I mean, it was total Scientology. There’s no question.”AdvertisementJawaharlal, who guest-lectured at the school from 2008 to 2010, also says he observed posters of Hubbard on the walls, and that most of New Village Leadership Academy teachers were Scientologists.“Yes, there were posters on the wall. I didn’t even know who that was!” says Jawaharlal. “There were teachers there who were constantly talking about building materials into the curriculum that were related to Scientology. There were teachers there that I met and Icouldn’t even understandwhat they were saying. There was a geography teacher there, and I’m pretty well-versed in geography, but they were saying this vague stuff. There seemed to be an agenda. I mean, I’d sit in on classes and listen to these teachers and they were using weird words that I didn’t even know.”Olivier alleges that, in addition to study technology, the New Village Leadership Academy was implementing a number of other Scientology practices, including the “Tone Scale,” charting and analyzing a person’s emotion; the “Qualifications Division” or “Qual,” which verifies results and corrects wrongs; “Debugging,” or breaking down one’s barriers. It would also label people as “Suppressive Persons,” or those who, in the words of Hubbard, seek “to suppress, or squash, any betterment activity or group.”Leah Remini and Mike Rinder, two former high-ranking Scientologists (Rinder was their ex-spokesman and senior executive) who’verededicated themselves to exposing the Church of Scientology’s alleged abuses, say that study technology is a back-door way of getting people into Scientology.“L. Ron Hubbard’s study technology is a means of infiltrating areas of society: governments, schools, politics. This is pursuant to Hubbard’s policies on ‘allying’ organizations and groups to legitimize Scientology, and also as a first step in getting more of his ‘technology’ into use,” Remini and Rinder told me in a statement. “The concept is that if you can get someone to use one bit of the ‘tech’ they will be so impressed by it that they will want to find out more of his ‘tech.’ This is covered extensively by Hubbard in his ‘Public Relations’ policies, especially in one he titled, ‘The Public Image.’ And so you know, he directed that his ‘study tech’ be ‘secularized’ so it could be introduced to government agencies and public schools without running afoul of the separation of church and state doctrine in the U.S.—and so the front organizations established to do this (in this case, Applied Scholastics International) would be able to get government grants.”AdvertisementScientologist Tom Cruise attends the grand opening of Applied Scholastics International's new headquarters on July 26, 2003, in St.Louis, Missouri. Applied Scholastics is a Scientology-affiliated group.Mark Mainz/GettyIndeed, Hubbard once wrote that study technology is Scientology’s “primary bridge to society.” In the U.S. it is practiced in the Delphi Schools, a number of private schools across the country which have managed to get study technology approved by regulators by claiming it is a nondenominational “supplementary text.”“Scientologists who don’t want to come right out and say they are (or were) Scientologists usually downplay their association by saying things like: ‘We think L. Ron Hubbard’s technology on how to study and learn is something we found very helpful’ to avoid having to answer directly about their involvement in Scientology,” Remini and Rinder conclude.Plus, Olivier claims many of the young students at New Village Leadership Academy were said to be frustrated by the limitations placed on their learning through study technology.According to former teachers and administrators, there was a “culture clash” between the non-Scientologist teachers hired by Olivier, who were reluctant to employ study technology, and the Scientologist ones appointed by Will and Jada Pinkett Smith.Advertisement“There was instant clashing, because you can’t use study technology with kids. We had about 65 kids there [at New Village Leadership Academy], and every time a kid yawned they said it was a ‘misunderstood word.’”This concept of “word clearing,” or deciphering the “misunderstood word,” is the most important “barrier to study” of Hubbard’s study technology.“The ‘misunderstood word’ is the one that has most emphasis placed on it in Scientology. Hubbard claimed that going past a misunderstood word (abbreviated, like many things in Scientology as ‘M/U’ or ‘MU’) would result in the subsequent words or sentences being ‘blank.’ You would become tired or yawn,” explains Rinder. “When you come across a word you don’t understand you are supposed to look it up in a dictionary and understand every definition and the derivation of the word. You take each definition and ensure you understand all the words in it and if not, look those up. You then make sentences using the word to ensure you fully understand the meaning. It is alaboriousprocess.”Olivier recalls being constantly approached by young kids at New Village Leadership Academy who were frustrated by its “word clearing” exercises.“One kid came to me and she’d found this article about cats yawning, and she said, ‘Yawning is involuntary! It doesn’t mean we have a misunderstood word.’ I was like,yeah. And that was considered heresy, agreeing with her,” says Olivier.“I said to Jada, ‘It’s stopping and starting. They can’t move forward and everything is bogged down.’ They would have fifth graders reading second-grade material—just one paragraph, because they would stop at every word...”Advertisement“It was more like a babysitting exercise—since the kids weren’t listening, and there was no structured curriculum,” adds Jawaharlal. “You need to have some direction. A 7-year-old doesn’t know what’s right or what’s wrong. It wasn’t a rigorous program. In the name of ‘creativity,’ they were just letting the kids do whatever they want. But the principal [Olivier] was really trying hard.”The school opened its doors in August of 2008; by November, Olivier began voicing her issues with study technology to the Smiths.“I said to Jada, ‘It’s stopping and starting. They can’t move forward and everything is bogged down.’ They would have fifth graders reading second-grade material—just one paragraph, because they would stop at every word,” says Olivier. “And in math, you couldn’t even do 2+2 until you understood the word ‘plus’ and ‘equal,’ and I understand knowing your vocabulary, but then they had the kids ‘clear’ every word in the math glossary before they even did any math! How can you understand what the word ‘averaging’ means before you’ve even learned averaging?”“And then it was like,Crap… what did I get myself into?”Plus, as Olivier tells it, parents began catching wind of the Scientology teachings at New Village Leadership Academy and pulling their kids from the school.“There were a few parents who really got vocal, and were like, ‘This is Scientology!’ and then their kids left the school,” says Olivier. “[Will & Jada] just didn’t understand that nobody wants to go to a Scientology school—especially when you’re not admitting that that’s what it is.”AdvertisementThe problems proved insurmountable for Olivier, who left the school at the end of her first year. At the time, the Smiths insisted that it had nothing to do with the school’s Scientology teachings, with their rep claiming, “Jacquie is no longer at the school for reasons entirely unrelated to curriculum. She is an excellent educator and fully embraced the school’s secular and open-minded approach to innovative teaching methodologies.”Olivier says this was not the case.“They started seeing me as not on board [with Scientology]. They would constantly say, ‘Are you sure you’re on board?’” says Olivier. “We would have these meetings with Will where they’d bring in these big guys from Scientology.”Jawaharlal backs Olivier’s version of events. “All I knew was that it was related to Scientology, that she didn’t have the full authority to run the school, and that [Olivier] resisted the school’s Scientology curriculum,” he says.Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes pose at a luncheon at the Beverly Hills Hotel on February 21, 2008, in Beverly Hills, California.Charley Gallay/GettyThe Smiths subsequently hired Piano Foster (who also goes by Franca Campopiano), the wife of their trainer, to run the school. Foster was a Scientologist. (Foster did not respond to requests for comment.)Advertisement“The new principal, I don’t think she knew what she was doing,” says Jawaharlal. “I think she was part of their strategy.”Queenie Johnson, who taught at the New Village Leadership Academy from 2009-2013—and is not a Scientologist herself—says that the school began gradually “phasing out” its Scientology practices as the years progressed. (Others dispute this claim.)“The school always talked about ‘clearing’ words and things like that. That was something that helped [Jada] and her child initially. The idea that a kid understands a word, that is a very helpful teaching concept. But I don’t have to do it the way that L. Ron does it,” she says, adding, “I wasn’t ever going to be teachinganyScientology. Who’s gonna pay for L. Ron Hubbard or anything he has to say?”New Village Leadership Academy closed its doors in 2013. Despite its troubles, all of the teachers and administrators I spoke to for this story expressed disappointment that the school didn’t succeed, given its stated goal of providing a creative educational environment for disadvantaged children of color. Part of the reason was that it wasn’t financially sustainable. Tax filings revealed that Foster was making $225,872 a year, and that other salaries at the 16-teacher school came to $1,276,181; meanwhile, New Village Leadership Academy was only receiving just $740,000 in tuition payments, putting it squarely in the red.“The founders were very open to people being there on scholarship, the teachers were paidreallywell. It really was a financial situation at the end,” says Johnson. “What was there that is overlooked is it was an environment for Black children to feel comfortable with themselves.”AdvertisementFinancial woes aside, the Smiths’ lack of transparency concerning its Scientology ties also represented a problem. To this day, Will and Jada Pinkett Smith haven’t taken full responsibility for the school’s Scientology curriculum.“Schools have an obligation to be transparent about who they are, what they are, and what they teach,” says Ron Reynolds, head of the California Association of Private School Organizations (CAPSO). “If a school is enabling students to successfully transition to the next level of learning, that’s what’s important to me. But it can’t be done under false pretenses.”Jawaharlal puts it more bluntly: “A school should be all about creating a great learning experience. It wasnotabout that. It was about something else.”Marlow SternSenior Entertainment Editor@marlownycGot a tip?

It started when he was introduced as a rapper next to DJ Jazzy Jeff. Starting off as nothing but a kid from Philly with a dream, The Fresh Prince blew up with huge hit records like "Summertime" and "Parents Just Don't Understand." In between that time, he decided to crossover into rap and afterThe Fresh Prince of Bel Airwas a hit, Will went to Hollywood. He now has several award-winning movies under his belt and just as many critically acclaimed performances.Outside of acting, Will married Jada-Pinkett. They had two kids together, one of which was Jaden Smith. After a few years of trying out acting and deciding it failed to strike his fancy, Jaden took under his dad's footsteps in becoming a rapper. He has found some incredible success as a musician. After a slew of mixtapes and loose singles, Jaden's debut albumSyredebuted at #10 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Billboard chart and peaked at #24 on the Billboard 200.Another thing that Jaden inherited from his dad is that he's a workaholic, but also like his dad, he feels like he needs a vacation every once in a while.25JADEN: A BEACH VACATION IN BRAZILBack in May 2016, in hopes of celebrating the launch of the summer season just a little bit earlier than expected, Jaden Smith got a first class ticket to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil with some friends where they all enjoyed kicking back on the beach with the sun rays beaming onto them.Jaden Smith was seen on the beach swimming through the waters in Calvin Klein briefs. There was also a point during his Brazil trip where he took a detour from water dipping and got some pro photo work done to support his side gig as a model.24WILL: CELEBRATING FATHER'S DAY IN HUNGARYEarlier this summer, starting in June, Will Smith began filming for his latest movieGemini Man, which is to be directed by the Oscar-winning director ofBrokeback Mountain,Ang Lee.As the saying goes, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Will's name may not be Jack, but the Ali actor decided to give himself a day's worth of vacation in Hungary, Budapest for Father's Day. He celebrated his special day by sightseeing with his wife Jada Pinkett, daughter Willow, son Trey, and friends. Jaden would've been there, but he missed his flight, according to Will.23JADEN: IN MIAMI WITH GIRLFRIEND SARAH SNYDERSarah Snyder is a model who Jaden Smith used to date starting back in 2015 until they split in early 2017.Just a couple months before the breakup, the two vacationed together in Miami. While enjoying the sight of the seas, the pair was caught by paparazzi while under an umbrella at the beach. Rather than panic at getting caught, they were comfortable enough and not camera shy enough to embrace the sight of the camera.22WILL: A SOLO VACATION IN TUSCANY, ITALYIn 2014, four years before he would bring his family there for a summer vacation, Will Smith would take a solo vacation to the beautiful country of Italy. Specifically, Smith visited the country's central city of Tuscany.Tuscany served as the next destination on Will Smith's European Vacation list. Previously that summer, he trekked through Ibiza and Spain. The Pursuit of Happyness actor closed out his Western European vacation by heading over to Pisa where he took a selfie in front of the Leaning Tower.21JADEN: OUT ON A HIKE IN MALIBU WITH KENDALL JENNERJaden Smith has long been friends with the Kardashian-Jenner connection ever since he was a kid back when he used to date Kylie Jenner. The two may not remain as close coming out of their relationship, but the "Icon" rapper remains good pals with her sister Kendall. The two creative personalities met up just as recently as last month for brunch, according to Daily Mail.Back in 2015, while on vacation in Malibu, Jaden and Kendall went on a hike together with some friends.20WILL: MIAMI BLOCK PARTY WITH CASTMATESIt was only back in 1997 when Will Smith rapped about his love for the city of "Miami" in a song of the same name. Just under 20 years later, the rapper turned actor returned to the Floridian city to hose a block party to promote his latest filmSuicide Squad.At the block party, Will was seen partying it up with hisSuicide Squadcastmates, which included Oscar nominee Margot Robbie. The Aussie born actress had previously played Will's love interest in caper flickFocus. In their follow-up superhero romp, she played Harley Quinn while Smith played Deadshot.19JADEN: HOLIDAY IN MIAMI WITH GF ODESSA ADLONAs of 2017, Jaden Smith has been dating rising actress Odessa Adlon. Anyone who is not familiar with Odessa Adlon may be more likely to have heard of her famous mother, Pamela Adlon. Pamela is best known for being the Emmy winning voice of Bobby Hill onKing of the Hill, the co-producer ofLouie, and the writer/creator/star of FX'sBetter Things.The romance between Odessa and Jaden seems to be going strong, especially following their romantic getaway to Miami back in April.18WILL: PARTYING IN MUMBAI WITH BOLLYWOOD STARSIn 2016, Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar held a special party at his home to celebrate having three hit movies that year. Fans expected the party to include big stars from the Bollywood scene - which it did - but one actor who no one expected to make an appearance was Hollywood's Will Smith.Apparently, Smith and Kumar are good friends with each other. Kumar was kind enough as a host to spend much of the party catering to everyone's needs and introducing them to The Fresh Prince. Smith loved Mumbai enough to return in 2017 and 2018.17JADEN: HAS BRUNCH WITH JAY-Z IN CALIFORNIAAs a musician, Jaden Smith is currently signed to Jay-Z's label, Roc Nation. Under his tutelage, the heir of the Smith family has learned a lot of valuable knowledge regarding the industry from Beyonce's husband. In his song, "GHOST," Jaden told his listeners that "When [he] wanna grow, [he] listen to Hov, take notes," shedding light on just how far Jay's mentorship has taken Jaden.When they were together in California, Jay and Jaden shared a pre-Grammy brunch together. Surely, Jay passed on some wise words in between meals.16WILL: FAMILY VACATION IN HAWAIIIt would be an understatement to say that Will Smith loves the 50th state of the United States. Will is so in love with the state of Hawaii - in fact - that up until he sold this property in 2017 for $12 million, he and his wife Jada Pinkett-Smith used to own a Kauai getaway compound out there in Hawaii.Back in December 2015 for the holiday, Will brought the whole family along with him on a big vacation to Hawaii. Jaden and Willow were surfing while Jada and Will were just enjoying the sun on the beach.15JADEN: CELEBRATING 4TH OF JULY IN MALIBU WITH KENDALL JENNERAs we mentioned earlier, Jaden Smith is a big friend to both the Kardashians and the Jenners family. In many regards, Jaden gets treated by both the Jenners and the Kardashians as if he were an extended member of the family.The whole family especially loved and spent a whole bunch of time with Jaden back when he was still dating Kylie Jenner. When they were still dating in 2013, Jaden tagged along on a trip to Malibu with his then-girlfriend Kylie, Kendall, and some friends.14WILL: VISITING ETHIOPIA WITH HIS WIFE JADA PINKETTFor just over 21 years now, Will and Jada Pinkett Smith have been in a long and loving marriage to each other. It is a marriage that spawned two children and a combined net worth of $320 million. Add that number to the cute chemistry they always emulate while in public, they seem to have a marriage that anyone would die for.The two longtime lovers decided to go on a romantic getaway with each other on a trip to Ethiopia. In addition to a vacation, they also visited some charity water projects.13JADEN: CELEBRATING 18TH BDAY AT WIRELESS FESTAs a kid coming from the rich household of the Smith family, someone like Jaden Smith is expected to always go big when it comes to planning big birthday events. This was especially the case for his huge milestone of turning 18 years old.To celebrate his 18th trip around the sun, Jaden decided to take his whole family to London so that they could all celebrate his birthday at the Wireless Festival. Wireless Fest is a much acclaimed and famous music festival.12WILL: MOBBED BY FANS ON A BEACH IN IBIZAIn 2014, Will Smith spent his summer going on a wonderful vacation by himself around Western Europe. Among all of the Western European tourist spots he went to, he went out to Ibiza.While in Ibiza, he hung out with a few friends - among them being DJ Calvin Harris - on a superyacht, at nightclubs, and on the beach. The beach had to be a surreal experience for Will as it is perfectly legal to roam Ibiza beaches while topless. When seen approached by a topless woman who wanted a picture with him, the actor seemed a bit flustered.11JADEN: FILMING A MUSIC VIDEO WHILE ON VACATION IN COLOMBIASometimes, a true artist's work is never over. Not even while on vacation. This is especially the case for Mr. Rapper, Jaden Smith, who while on vacation in Colombia back in April was seen filming a music video on one of the Colombian beaches.No word yet on which song Jaden made a music video. Most of the speculation is pointing towards either a yet to be released single from his next album -Erys- or something from his recently released EP titledThe Sunset Tapes: A Cool Tape Story.10WILL: A TRIP THROUGH AFRICA WITH MODELSMany African Americans deem it essential to visit Africa at least once in their lifetime to truly experience what it means to walk through their motherland. Will Smith felt this similar urge when he decided to visit Africa back in 2017.As part of his African vacation, he only accompanied a handful of friends on his personal voyage; most of which were models. Specifically, he brought with him Sterling Shepard, a Victoria Secret's Angel - Chanel Iman - and a bunch of her model friends.9JADEN: IN COSTA RICA WITH HIS MOM AND DADWill Smith has only made a small handful of movies together. The most notable beingThe Pursuit of Happyness -which earned a Best Actor Oscar nomination for Papa Smith - and a notorious box office bomb inAfter Earth.The father and son duo filmed that latter movie in Costa Rica, but when they were not on the set, they were enjoying some quality downtime and familial bonding moments. Will's wife and Jaden's mother - Jada - was in tow as well and while there, she took the time to teach Jaden some Spanish.8WILL: FAMILY VACATION IN JAMAICAWill Smith frequently brings his family along to wondrous spots in the world for vacation all year round, but perhaps none have ever been as wondrous as the family's vacation trip to Jamaica.Will brought his sons Trey and Jaden, daughter Willow, wife Jada Pinkett, some friends, and Jada's mother Adrienne Banfield-Jones out to Jamaica in 2014 to celebrate a very special Thanksgiving Day. Rather than turkey that coincides with the spirit of America's birth, the Smith family indulged in local Jamaican cuisine whilst listening to Reggae music.7JADEN: SURFING WITH HIS SISTER IN HAWAIIWe mentioned earlier how much Will Smith is in love with the state of Hawaii. As it turns out, he managed to spread that love affectionately onto his two kids. Both Jaden and Willow seem to be in love with the land as well considering they both went on trips to Hawaii outside of their family vacation.While on holiday last January on a brother and sister vacation, Jaden and Willow Smith chose none other than the great state of Hawaii as their choice of destination.6WILL: CELEBRATING TYRESE'S 35TH BDAY IN DUBAIBack in 2014, Will Smith traveled to Dubai to celebrate his buddy Tyrese's 35th birthday. Both men were accompanied by R&B singer Maxwell as they enjoyed the Dubai scenery while also wearing the country's cultural garb.We are not sure just how close these two supposed friends are nowadays considering the strange developments in their relationship in recent years. In 2017, theFast & Furiousactor claimed that Will & Jada Pinkett Smith gave him $5 million to stay off social media, only for Will to come and quickly debunk those remarks.Subscribe to our newsletterCommentsShareTweetShareShareShareCopyEmailShareShareTweetShareShareShareCopyEmailLink copied to clipboardRelated TopicsLifestyleAbout The AuthorJoe Anthony Myrick(33 Articles Published)Joe Anthony Myrick is a photographer, journalist, and a music video director.

Because we covet the travels of Will Smith, who is one of the best-traveled celebs out there. It’s not hard to be when you’re promoting films that gross over a billion dollars worldwide. Whether Will is on a press junket in Japan or taking some R&R with his family, he travels in style.Mumbai, IndiaHow convenient it was that the Smiths had planned for a family vacation to India in April. Despite the Oscars debacle, Jada insisted that the couple go on the trip so as to connect and recenter. Where Will Smith travels is usually about the spectacle of his arrival. This time, he and Jada took time to meet with a spiritual leader to privately do some inner healing. Will famously loves India  and says that the country helps him awaken a new understanding of himself. It wouldn’t be hard to relax where he stayed at theJW Marriot Hotelin Juhu.Zanzibar, TanzaniaDespite now known for his somewhat dramatic display of heroism, Will is also a proponent of smaller acts of service. Recently, he and Jada traveled to Zanzibar where they facilitated several projects at the District Hospital in Bagamoyo. The trip wasn’t all work and no play, however, as they stayed atThe Residence Zanzibar. The hotel has coastal views and a prime spot on the Northern Coast of the island.Sydney, AustraliaPromotional trips aside, Will loves it down under. You just have to stalk his instagram to see that where Will travels, he documents. And Australia made a big appearance during his latest trip. Unlike other celeb instagrammers, Will is not concerned with posting glossy, staged photos. Instead, he goes full dad mode with close up selfies and foodie pics he claims not to love. It’s hard to complain, though, as his adventures at the Opera House, the Bridge climb, and at brunch atPorch and Parlourin Bondi Beach will inspire anyone to visit the far away continent.ShareTweetPinLinkedInPrevious PostChristian Bale On VacationNext Post3 Spots to Vacation Like Drew BarrymoreNEXT ARTICLE3 Spots to Vacation Like Drew BarrymoreBy Joelle MentisJune 1, 2022MoreBOOK MY TRIP NOWStaysFlightsCarsCheck-inCheck-outSearchPowered by ExpediaPrevious PostChristian Bale On VacationNext Post3 Spots to Vacation Like Drew BarrymoreNEXT ARTICLE3 Spots to Vacation Like Drew BarrymoreBy Joelle MentisJune 1, 2022MoreTRENDING ON GALAVANTEEvents & TastemakersTop Chef Eric AdjepongFOODRamp Matzo Ball SoupTravel BuzzSouthall Opens in TennesseeStyleSetting the Perfect TableFamily Travel,Luxury Family Travel & LifestyleMauna Lani: A Family Trip to HawaiiRoad TripThe Retreat: Joshua TreeThe SpecialWhere to Eat in GuatemalaTHE WEEKLYBE IN THE KNOW.TRAVEL.
