It named Bezos, along with Google founders Larry Page and Sergei Brin, and Will Wright, the designer of the videogame The Sims.The article also noted that young Bezos “would get so engrossed in his activities as a Montessori preschooler that his teachers would literally have to pick him up out of his chair to go to the next task,” according to his mother.Little wonder, then, that free “Montessori inspired” education is an interest for Bezos’srecently announced $2 billion Day One Fund.Camden, a preschooler, stacks blocks at the MacDowell Montessori School in Milwaukee.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos experienced a similar Montessori education as a child.Sara Stathas for Education Week“It is potentially a game changer,” said Jacqueline Cossentino, the director of research for the National Center for Montessori in the Public Sector.
There hasn’t been this kind of investment in any model, let alone Montessori.
We’re eager to see what he has in mind.”Over time, Montessori education has taken on a stereotype that it is mostly for the rich, because, in the United States, the educational framework is primarily offered in private schools.But Maria Montessori, the Italian physician and educator who built the educational framework in the early 1900s after years of observation on how children learn, started her work with children with disabilities and from low-income families—examples, perhaps, of the “underserved communities” that Bezos says he wants to reach with his new initiative.Distinguishing FeaturesMontessori education offers several features that distinguish it from typical preschool classrooms.
For example, classrooms feature multi-age groupings.
They use specific materials intended to encourage touch and play appropriate to a child’s interests and development.
Children are allowed much more free choice in what materials they can use, and there’s a premium placed on intrinsic motivation: Children master tasks based on their own needs and wants, rather than working for praise or for other types of rewards.
Under the educational framework, teachers are guides, rather than drivers of student activity.See AlsoAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos’ Ambitious Pre-K Move Sparks Wary Reactions“In that kind of environment, children are developing so many of the soft skills that 21st century learners need to have,” said Andrea Corona, the principal of Macdowell Montessori School, a public school in the Milwaukee school system that enrolls children from age 3 to 12th grade.There is research that suggests children from low-income backgrounds do benefit from high-quality Montessori classrooms.Angeline Lillard, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, studied public Montessori programs in Milwaukee and in Hartford, Conn.
In Milwaukee, she found stronger math, reading, and executive function skills among elementary-age children who attended public Montessori programs, compared with similar children who attended traditional schools.
In Hartford, Lillard found low-income children in Montessori programs academically outperformed similar children enrolled in typical preschools.‘A Certain Dignity’One big question, however, is whether it is Montessori that makes the difference, or whether the type of educators drawn to the philosophy are primed to be excellent teachers no matter what.Lillard said some smaller studies suggest that Montessori materials do make a difference, but there needs to be more research.
Lillard is among several researchers in the early stages of the first large-scale, federally funded longitudinal study of Montessori effectiveness that will study public programs in multiple locations.“The Montessori environment has a certain dignity,” Lillard said.
Regardless of their background, [children] have a sense of self and who they are.”Bezos’ interest in expanding the educational philosophy further is exciting, she said.
All children should be able to have this.”Christina A.

80]He later said: "Bezos could play a profound role.
If he said today, nobody who is employed at Amazon will receive less than a living wage, it would send a message to every corporation in America.

Named after the South American river, Amazon sold its first book in July 1995.Amazon.comJeff BezosAmazon quickly became the leader in e-commerce.
Open 24 hours a day, the site was user-friendly, encouraging browsers to post their own reviews of books and offering discounts, personalized recommendations, and searches for out-of-print books.

Amazon diversified even further in 2006 by introducingAmazon Web Services(AWS), acloud-computingservice that eventually became the largest such service in the world.

MacKenzie Bezos was one of Amazon's first employees, and according to Amazon lore, Jeff Bezos drafted part of the company's business plan while the couple drove across the country together.Read more:Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, announce they are divorcingAs the story goes, Jeff and MacKenzie Bezosmet in 1992when they were both employees at the New York City hedge fund D.E.
Jeff Bezos worked his way up to senior vice president at the firm, while MacKenzie Bezos, then MacKenzie Tuttle, worked there as a research associate.The two married in 1993, and a year later, Jeff Bezos told his wife about his revolutionary plan for an online bookstore that he would later name Amazon.
I'm not a businessperson.
So to me, what I'm hearing when he tells me that idea is the passion and the excitement," MacKenzie Bezostold CBS in 2013.
And to me, you know, watching your spouse, somebody that you love, have an adventure — what is better than that, and being part of that?In 1994, the couple drove from New York City to Seattle, the eventual Amazon headquarters, with MacKenzie Bezos driving and Jeff Bezos "tapping out a business plan on his computer along the way,"as Wired wrote in 1999.
With their dog Kamala in tow, "Jeff spent the trip pecking out a business plan on a laptop computer and calling prospective investors on a cell phone,"according to Entrepreneur.MacKenzie Bezos became an accountant for Amazon, and is considered one of the company's earliest employees.According to Wired, she was responsible for negotiating Amazon's first freight contracts, ironically, at a Barnes and Noble bookstore.Read more:Here's where Amazon's first 21 employees are nowMacKenzie Bezos, who in college was an assistant to the author Toni Morrison,is now a novelist.In his announcement in January, Jeff Bezos said, "we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends.

By comparison, the 2017 median household income in theU.S.
was $60,336.
Yet Medina is running out of money — and the irony is lost on no one.So how is the home of the richest people on the planet coming up short?The problem is, even though Medina home values are increasing, the city's income is not rising at the same speed, the city says.
You may find it hard to imagine that the City doesn't have enough income to sustain current service levels, particularly in this economy.
While property values continue to rise, the City's tax revenues don't rise in tandem," reads aJune 2019 Medina city newsletter.That's because by law, the local government cannot increase the amount of tax revenue it collects by more than 1% each year without the residents voting to approve a larger amount.The property tax rate in Washington state is set as a rate, not a percentage, Medina's director of finance Julie Ketter tellsCNBC Make It.
For Medina, the property tax rate is $7.92925 per $1,000 of assessed value.Of that, only $0.63486 goes to the city of Medina, Ketter says.
Another $2.42782 goes to local schools, $0.12266 goes to the port, $1.21906 goes to the county, $0.37441 goes to the library, $0.21762 goes to emergency medical services, $0.09660 goes to a flood fund, $0.20700 goes to regional transit and $2.62992 goes to the state school fund.
TWEET: Need more proof that Washington's tax system is as messed up as it gets?The most expensive home in Medina is assessed by the King County Assessors office as being worth $131,239,000, Ketter tells CNBC Make It.
This home —presumably Gates "Xanadu 2.0,"which has 24 bathrooms and a trampoline room — has a $1,040,627 total property tax in 2019.
Of that, $83,318 will go to the City of Medina.But comparatively, the majority of the homes in Medina are not as expensive: The median value of a home in Medina is just over $2 million, Ketter says.VIDEO1:0301:03Billionaires Bill and Melinda Gates play this 'crazy' game to unwindMake ItTherefore, in 2019, Medina will bring in only $2.8 million in property taxes, the City says.
A 1% increase of that is an additional $28,000, which is not enough to cover rising expenses.
Fire services alone increased by nearly double that amount in 2019," the newsletter reads.To fix the budget shortfall in Medina, the town will vote in November to lift the cap on property taxes enough to "provide funds to continue current service levels without significant cuts," the newsletter reads.The proposed increase of property taxes in Medina would increase the property tax by 20 cents per $1,000 of assessed value, Ketter says.
For a $2 million home, that would be $400 per year in 2020 and an increase of $589 per year in 2025, Medina says.The city, if it continues to operate without raising property taxes, will have a deficit of $500,000 by 2020 and a deficit of $3.3 million by 2025, the City says.
We're on an unsustainable path," the newsletter says.The fiscal problem in Medina is illustrative of a larger taxation issue in the state of Washington, whichdoesn't have a personal or corporate income tax.
In 2001, a rule limiting the increase in revenue brought in from property taxes to 1% per year was voted in.
The state's supreme court overturned the law and then it wasbrought back again in 2007.The cap is so restrictive that it can cripple local budgets.
Need more proof that Washington's tax system is as messed up as it gets?
Even the richest town in the state can't make it work," Seattle Times columnist Danny Westneat wrote of Medina on Friday.
The town of 3,200 is discovering what King County, Seattle and countless other municipalities around here have been screaming for nearly two decades: the math doesn't work anymore.
Westneat continued: "I hear some really important people live in Medina.
Maybe now that it's their town that's said to be in 'dire straits,' these questions will finally get some traction.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and wife MacKenzie to divorce | ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportfor-phone-onlyfor-tablet-portrait-upfor-tablet-landscape-upfor-desktop-upfor-wide-desktop-upBusiness NewsUpdatedAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos and wife MacKenzie to divorceByJonathan Stempel,Jeffrey Dastin5 Min Read(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person, and his wife MacKenzie Bezos are divorcing after 25 years of marriage, the couple said on Twitter on Wednesday.FILE PHOTO: Amazon CEO Jeff and wife MacKenzie Bezos arrive at the 2018 Vanity Fair Oscar Party in Beverly Hills, California.
REUTERS/Danny Moloshok/File PhotoJeff Bezos, 54, has a fortune that has soared as high as $160 billion thanks to his stake in Amazon, which again became Wall Street’s most valuable company this week, surpassing Microsoft Corp.Bezos has credited MacKenzie, 48, for her support when he uprooted the young couple to Seattle from New York to launch Amazon, an online bookseller that grew into the world’s largest internet retailer.MacKenzie Bezos, a Princeton graduate who is now a novelist, did accounting for Amazon for its first year after it was founded in 1994.The couple decided to divorce after a long period of “loving exploration” and trial separation, and expect to remain partners in ventures and projects, according to the joint statement.Amazon shares ended up 0.2 percent on Wednesday.
The divorce should have no material impact on the company and its shares, said Tom Forte, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co.According to Refinitiv Eikon data, MacKenzie does not hold any Amazon shares directly, while Bezos has a 16.1 percent stake worth about $130 billion.
Forbes magazine now estimates his overall net worth at $137.1 billion.Liat Sadler, a San Francisco matrimonial lawyer, noted that spouses owe a fiduciary duty to one another.“They have duties not to waste or devalue marital resources, and to keep the value of marital property as high as possible,” she said.
I don’t think there is an issue of concern for shareholders as to what will happen to Amazon because of the divorce.”Sadler said the main options facing the couple regarding Amazon stock were for Jeff Bezos to buy out his wife, or for MacKenzie Bezos to retain shares.“If she trusts that he would manage Amazon well, either he should pay her for her share of the stock, or they could enter a more complicated agreement where she keeps stock and he keeps voting rights,” she said.It is unlikely that many details of the divorce will become public, according to New York lawyer Bernard Clair, who represents Judith Giuliani in her divorce from Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and current lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump.“These two have been separated for a not insignificant time, and I would assume ... they would have used the time to reach a private, confidential agreement,” Clair said, referring to Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos.Reuters was unable to determine any further financial details of the planned divorce.“Jeff remains focused on and engaged in all aspects of Amazon,” said Drew Herdener, vice president of communications for the company.
He declined to comment on how the divorce might affect the ownership stake.MacKenzie Bezos met her husband when interviewing for a job at a New York hedge fund, according to a 2013 profile in Vogue.The two were engaged after three months of dating and married three months after that, according to the magazine.
They have four children.Speaking at an event in Berlin last April, Jeff Bezos said his wife’s support was instrumental when he founded Amazon.“When you have loving and supportive people in your life, like MacKenzie, my parents, my grandfather, my grandmother, you end up being able to take risks,” he said.Jeff Bezos in September committed $2 billion through the Bezos Day One Fund to helping homeless families and starting pre-schools for low-income communities.
He had solicited ideas on Twitter in 2017 for ways to donate some of his wealth.Last January, the couple donated $33 million to fund college scholarships for U.S. high schoolers with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status, an Obama-era program protecting young immigrants brought to the United States illegally by their parents.In 2012, they donated $2.5 million to a Washington state campaign to legalize same-sex nuptials there.From modest beginnings, Amazon branched out into almost every product category, taking on established retailers such as Walmart Inc.In November, Amazon picked America’s financial and political capitals for massive new offices, branching out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in New York City and a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C.Jeff Bezos also founded space company Blue Origin in 2000, and is funneling more than $1 billion a year of his own fortune into pulling it out of start-up mode and into production.He also owns the Washington Post, which has been a frequent target of criticism from Trump.Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Jeffrey Dastin, additional reporting by Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru; Writing by Meredith Mazzilli; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Susan ThomasOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.AppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

I posted our first job opening 25 years ago today, when I hadn't even settled on the name Amazon yet," he wrote.
The name at the time was Cadabra, a shortened version of the magician's expression, "abracadabra."
After Bezos' lawyer said "Cadabra" sounded like "cadaver" over the phone, Bezos changed it.
Feels like yesterday," Bezos wrote, ending with the hashtag "#gratitude.
Bezos' listing said he was seeking "extremely talented" developers "to help pioneer commerce on the Internet."
And with the same high standards Bezos requires today, he wrote that candidates should be able to build large, complex systems "in about one-third the time that most competent people think possible.
That exacting work ethos became an importantprincipleat the company and helped Bezos build Amazon into a business that currently has an$866.3 billionmarket cap.In hisfirst letter to shareholders in 1997, Bezos touted his deliberate hiring as "the single most important element of Amazon.com's success.
The past year's success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team.
Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com's success," Bezos said.He continued: "It's not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, 'You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can't choose two out of three'), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about.
Such things aren't meant to be easy.
We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com.
When I interview people I tell them, "You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can't choose two out of three.
Jeff BezosFounder and CEO, AmazonTwo decades later, Amazon's "high standards" were still a key theme.
You're going to build better products and services for customers — this would be reason enough!
Perhaps a little less obvious: people are drawn to high standards — they help with recruiting and retention," Bezos wrote inhis 2017 annual letter, published in April 2018.
I]t's part of what it means to be a professional," Bezos continued.
And "high standards are fun!
Once you've tasted high standards, there's no going back.
Amazonhas been criticizedforpushing employees to work too hardand in poor conditions.
Amazon denies the accusations.
In an industry leading move, Amazonraised its minimum wageto $15 per hour last year.

 Alan Kay-------------------------------------------------------------------At this time when Bezos posted this ad he had not even settled on the name "Amazon" for his startup, according to Brad Stone'sJeff Bezos biography,The Everything Store.Whoever replied to that post was applying to "Cadabra," as mentioned in the ad.
Awake.com," "Browse.com," or even "Relentless.com" were also names Bezos was considering at the time,according to the Stone.
If you type any of those three domains into your browser today, you'll be redirected to Amazon.The quote at the end is from computer scientist Alan Kay, winner of the 2003 Alan Turing Award -- computer science's most presitgious accolade.It may be lost to time who eventually got the job listed in the Usenet post, but soon thereafterBezos hired Shel Kaphanas the company's first employee and CTO in charge of building its technical infrastructure.In the job listing, Bezos said he was looking for an engineer who could build complicated systems in "about one-third the time that most competent people think possible."
In exchange, they would get "meaningful equity ownership.

Before it became the largest e-commerce company in the world, Bezos began selling books in Nov. 1994.A few years later, it expanded into selling computer games and music.
By the turn of the new millennium, Amazon started selling consumer electronics, video games, software, home improvement items, toys, and more.In the mid-2000s,Bezos founded Amazon Web Services, which marked the online retail company’s foray into tech.Today, Amazon has a market capitalization of $1.37 trillion — making it the fifth most valuable firm on the globe behind Apple, Saudi Aramco, Microsoft, and Alphabet Inc.Bezos, the third richest man in the world, stepped down as CEO of Amazon last year.Corbis via Getty ImagesBezos is the third richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of $158.2 billion,according to Forbes.Hestepped down as CEOof Amazon last year tomake way for the current chief executive, Andy Jassy.Share this article:FacebookTwitterFlipboardWhatsAppEmailCopyFiled underamazone-commercejeff bezosretailretailers8/24/22Read NextFlorida Gov.

Critics have chided Bezos for not signing theGiving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.Video Ad FeedbackExclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now01:50- Source:CNNIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”Asked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”Bezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.The 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and apossible economic recessionto Sánchez’s plan tovisit outer spacewith an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.Dolly PartonThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a$100 million grant to Partonas part of her Courage and Civility Award.
It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate andCNN contributor Van Jones.Getty ImagesDolly Parton receives $100 million Courage and Civility Award from Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right?
She is just beaming with light.
And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds.
And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”The throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.Unity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.How to give it awayBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune.
Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.Despite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to theBloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.Bezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs.
Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.Jose Andres, Jeff Bezos, Van Jones.Blue OriginBezos donates $100 million each to CNN contributor Van Jones and chef Jose AndresThough Bezos is now Amazon’s(AMZN)executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company.
Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s(AMZN)footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom.
Amazon’s(AMZN)reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.Bezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return.
It’s not easy.
Building Amazon was not easy.
It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added.
So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”Bezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recentlygave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizationsin the span of less than a year.The economic downturnWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.Last month, Bezostweeteda warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”Ringo H.W.
Chiu/AP/Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images'Batten down the hatches': Bezos and fellow billionaires are issuing recession warningsThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said.
Keep some dry powder on hand….
Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems.
You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”Many may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.Bezos and Sánchez’s partnershipSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said.
Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”Sánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot.
She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.Bezos has creditedhis own journey to spacefor helping to inspire his push to fight climate change.
Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.Sánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023.
And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”Washington’s NFL teamGetty ImagesJay-Z and Jeff Bezos are interested in buying the Washington Commanders togetherBezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume.
CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potentialjoint bid on the Washington Commanders.It is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.But during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.Sánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football.
I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”Bezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”– CNN’s Chloe Melas contributed to this reportRelatedAd FeedbackMore from CNN BusinessLucy Nicholson/ReutersCommercial real estate is in trouble.

Crucible, Amazon’s first game, is the perfect Jeff Bezos metaphor | WIRED UKSkip to main contentOpen Navigation MenuMenuCrucible, Amazon’s first game, is the perfect Jeff Bezos metaphorLong ReadsBusinessCultureGearScienceSecurityVideoMoreChevronSubscribeSearchSearchLong ReadsBusinessCultureGearScienceSecurityVideoSearchEventsJobsConsultingWe may earn a commission if you buy something from any affiliate links on our site.Learn more.Amit KatwalaCulture20.05.2020 12:07 PMCrucible, Amazon’s first game, is the perfect Jeff Bezos metaphorTeam-based shooter Crucible’s Alpha Hunters mode is all about working together – and then betraying your partnerAmazonInCrucible– the first release from Amazon Games – you play as part of a team dispatched to a lush, unspoilt planet and tasked with stripping it of its natural resources for monetary gain.The free-to-play, team-based PC shooter, which finally comes out today after a long-awaited, and then Covid-delayed launch, has been developed in conjunction with Relentless Studios, and was part of a line-up of three Amazon Studios games which were originally announced in2016.
Only two of those have made it, and along with MMONew World,Crucibleforms a key part of Amazon’s inevitable assault on the gaming industry.You play as one of ten ‘hunters’ – a group of aliens, humans and robots ranging from Ajonah, anAvatar-influenced marksman with a grappling hook and blue skin, to Bugg, aWALL-Einspired flying robot presumably repurposed from dropping off Amazon Prime deliveries.
To be honest it feels like they did a lot of the initial character development in 2009.The game is set in the distant future, on a jungle planet rich in a valuable substance called ‘Essence’.
Naturally, large corporations have their eye on it – this is a game from Amazon after all, whose founder Jeff Bezos has an ambitious plan to colonise space and harvest it for resources, while beingslow to clean up his company's carbon footprinthere on Earth.Most PopularThe World’s Longest Suspension Bridge Is History in the MakingByJacopo PriscoThe 39 Best Films on Netflix This WeekByWIREDEthereum’s Shanghai Update Opens a Rift in CryptoByJoel KhaliliThe 11 Best Shows on Apple TV+ Right NowByWIRED StaffAfter disastrously battling for control of the planet, the companies have now hired freelance hunters to harvest as much of it as possible (probably on zero hours contracts, with limited toilet breaks).
It’s a process that involves a lot more killing than you would expect.The game pulls off that classic tech giant trick of ransacking the best bits of rival products and then combining them into something that, while objectively better, feels a bit lacking in character, a little mechanical.
There are touches ofOverwatchin the characters and art style, while the game modes lean onLeague of Legends, and the monetised add-ons feel veryFortnite.
It is, the game’s senior combat designer toldWIRED US, designed to “feel familiar in all of its aspects but feel like a game you’ve never played before.”AlthoughCrucibleis Amazon’s first proper game release – barring an appalling tie-in with live-actionDaily Mailcomments sectionThe Grand Tour– it’s not the company’s first involvement in the games industry.
In fact, Amazon technology underpins huge swatches of the infrastructure supporting online play through Amazon Web Services.
The company is also working on a potential competitor to Google Stadia, which allows resource-intensive games to be streamed to low-powered devices, with all the processing done in the cloud.And then there’s Twitch.
Amazon bought the streaming service in 2014 for close to a billion dollars, and its now the de facto home of online games streaming, with billions of hours of footage watched every month.
WhenCruciblewas first announced in 2016, it was a pure battle royale game, with features designed to encourage Twitch streaming, in an era when people are almost as likely to watch someone playing a game online as they are to play it themselves.
But, after consulting with streamers, Relentless Gamesdecided to shelvesome of those Twitch-specific features for now, to focus on the game itself – although they did consult with streamers on the general look and feel of the characters.What setsCrucibleapart from the likes ofFortniteis the co-operative element running through every game mode.
There are three to choose from at launch.
In ‘Heart of the Hives,’ two teams of four players work together to take down huge monsters and capture their hearts.
Harvester Commander' is a bit like the King of the Hill mode fromHaloand other first-person shooters – two teams of eight players each earn points by capturing and holding ‘Essence Harvesters,’ with the winner the first to reach 100 points.The final mode is 'Alpha Hunters', which is the perfect encapsulation of Amazon’s business model, which – little business studies lesson here – is partly built on aggressively partnering with suppliers and brands, using its vast market share to build up reams of data on their customers and products, and then coming up with their own rival product thatundercuts their partners.Here, you team up with another player and work together to take out three other pairs of opponents, until there are only three of you left.
At that point, all alliances go out of the window, and you can laser cannon your former teammate in the back to claim victory and harvest that precious Essence until the planet is a dried husk of its former self.

The franchise that has caught Bezos’ eye is reportedly the Washington Commanders.
Bezos owns The Washington Post, so his interest in the Commanders makes sense.When current Washington ownerDaniel Snyder recently hired Bank of America to “explore potential transactions,” the Bezos rumors went into overdrive.Jay Glazer of FOX Sports reported Snyder’s intentionis a complete sale of the franchise.In a recent interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas, Bezos was asked about the buzz of potentially adding NFL owner to his resume.“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said while laughing.
Bezos’ partner, Lauren Sanchez spoke up and said, “I do like football.
I am just going to throw that out there for everyone,” she said.Bezos laughed and offered the following response.“There’s not much I can say about that right now, but she does like football.”Melas then asked Bezos if owning a professional sports team was always a part of his dream.“Well, I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid,” Bezos said.
It is my favorite sport; we’ll just have to wait and see.”After Bezos spoke, Sanchez chimed in again, “Once again, I do like football.”Will@JeffBezosbuy the Washington@Commanders?He was asked about it during a@cnninterview.pic.twitter.com/RDzWMWlNwx— Scott Abraham (@Scott7news)November 14, 2022Bezos is one of the multiple names with a reported interest in the Commanders.
There is a rumored partnership with millionaire music mogul Jay-Z as the two prepare a bid for the Washington NFL franchise.You can say a lot without saying a thing.
And that’s what Bezos did in this interview.
His words — or lack of words —combined with Sanchez’s “love” of football, tell you he plans to make a serious run at buying the Commanders.Story originally appeared on Commanders WireTRENDING1.Kyle Anderson says he and Rudy Gobert have 'hashed it out' after fight during timeout2.NFL Draft hopeful Michael Jefferson seriously injured in fatal Alabama car crash3.

Photo by Peter Sabok/COOLMedia/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Jeff Bezos is quickly building an impressive portfolio of streaming sports content that he is using to add members to his Amazon Prime service.Newreportshave Amazon linked with the remaining rights packages to La Liga, the top Spanish domestic league.
The two dominant teams in La Liga are Real Madrid and Barcelona, homes for the two biggest stars in soccer, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.
Perhaps just as important as the worldincreasingly moves to over-the-top viewingis that Ronaldo is themost popularsoccer player in the world on social media.In June, Amazonstruck a dealwith the English Premier League, Europe's most popular and richest league.
The deal gives U.K-based soccer fans with Prime membership access to 20 games per season for three seasons starting next year.
We are always looking to add more value to Prime, and we’re delighted to now offer, for the first time, live Premier League matches to Prime members at no extra cost to their membership,”said Jay Marine, vice president of Prime Video in Europe.
Over these two December fixture rounds, Prime members will be able to watch every team, every game, so no matter which Premier League team you support, you’re guaranteed to see them play live on Prime Video.”Amazon not only seems to have quickly surpassedTwitterin sports streaming, but it is also starting to look like it could go head to head withFacebook, Google'sYouTube TVand Walt Disney'sESPN+, which waslaunchedin April.
Amazon's advantage: its model not only brings in subscriber and advertising revenue but increases itretailingbusiness.
In April, the cost of Amazon Prime washikedto $119 a year from $99 andBezos told shareholders that the servicehas more than 100 million paying membersaround the world.It will not be easy for these companies to play burn poker with Bezos.
Amazon has $17 billion in cash, versus $13 billion for Alphabet (Google), $12 billion for Facebook and $2 billion for Twitter.
Disney, which has $4 billion of cash, is about to spend over$70 billionon much of 21st Century Fox.Last year, Amazon easilyoutbid Twitterfor streaming rights to the NFL's Thursday Night Football package.
Shortly afterward Amazonoutbid Skyfor the U.K. rights to the ATP World tennis tour.
This April Bezosnabbedthe U.K. rights to the U.S. Open tennis tournament.The deal means that Amazon can provide Prime Video subscribers with access to three of the four grand slams.
Subscribers who pay to access additional channels can also watch Eurosport, which has the UK rights to the Australian and French Opens.Tennis gave Bezos Roger Federer.
But with the La Liga deal, Bezos would bag Ronaldo, the most popular name in the world's most popular team sport.Send me a securetip.Mike OzanianEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

ReutersAnd Mr Bezos found the perfect home for his company in the mid-2000s: over 66,000 hectares of flat, dry land — perfect for launching rockets — situated about 40 kilometres from Van Horn.Read MoreBlue Origin unveils plans to build private space station 'business park'Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin has its eye on UAE desert for spaceportBlue Origin to fly 100,000 postcards from UAE pupils into spaceVan Horn's closest major cities are El Paso, two hours to the west, and Fort Stockton, two hours to the east.
Most I-10 travellers whizz right past Van Horn or use it as a pit stop before rolling on towards Tucson or Phoenix in Arizona.Over the course of last year, however, Van Horn — which relied heavily on tourism even before Blue Origin came along — received a major economic boost as astrophiles flooded the town, eager to witness wealthy rocketeers jetting off to space.But apart from the rockets' red glare, why would anyone want to visit the quiet town of 2,000 people?It turns out there's a lot to love about Van Horn, if you know where to look.Hotel El Capitan is one of the most popular places to stay not only in west Texas, but in the whole state.
Photo: Thomas MillardStayIf you decide to stay the night in Van Horn to catch a glimpse of one of Mr Bezos's rockets leaving the atmosphere, there are several comfortable places to stay, with the historic Hotel El Capitan being the crown jewel.Built in 1930 by the Gateway Hotel Chain, the pueblo-style building was designed by famed architect Henry Trost.It has 50 guest rooms and suites, some with private terraces and mini-courtyards with fountains, a handsome lobby with a cosy fireplace, and a gift shop packed with unique, eco-friendly souvenirs, such as locally sourced honey and handmade soaps.If pitching a tent or parking a caravan is more your speed, Van Horn has numerous options, some with swimming pools, horse corrals and dog parks as well as all the amenities one might expect when sleeping under the stars — trailer hookups, toilets and cleared pitch pads.PlayThe Clark Hotel Museum is one of the oldest structures in Van Horn and was completed in 1910.Trapped in time, some of the hotel's rooms have been preserved to show what life was like for the oilmen, ranchers and railway engineers who stayed under its roof.Other rooms hold artefacts from the town as well as oddities that former guests left behind.The original bar is still intact and there's even an ore car from the Hazel Silver Mine, once the second-largest producing mine in the state, parked on site for visitors to see.But the real place to play in Van Horn is outdoors.Hikers and bikers love the town due to its proximity to Guadalupe Mountains National Park, located less than an hour to the north.El Capitan is the southernmost point of this epic mountain range, and at 2,464 metres above sea level, it is the eighth-highest peak in Texas.
Its challenging terrain and distinct silhouette have made it famous among nature-lovers.Wildlife is also plentiful in and around the area, with grey foxes, desert cottontails, black-tailed jackrabbits, ringtails and rock squirrels common sights, though rare glimpses of mountain lions and packs of javelinas are also possible.If a scenic drive is more your thing, Carlsbad Caverns is only an hour and a half away.You can also schedule a private tour of the popular destination of Red Rocks Ranch, which also features camping.Jeff Bezos bought Longfellow Ranch in 2005, the same time the billionaire bought 66,773 hectares in West Texas.

The vessel can now be called by the name granted to it by its mega-rich owner: the Koru.
A Koru is a Māori symbol representing the spiral of an unfurling fern frond.Read moreThese Are Your Guilty Pleasure CarsThe 15 Most Successful Formula 1 Cars of All TimeThese Cars Should Never Have Been Killed Off“Its circular shape conveys the idea of perpetual movement, and its inward coil suggests a return to the point of origin.

It’s currently undergoing open-seas testing phase, which is consider one of the final steps before delivery.
The big boat enthusiast YouTube channelDutch Yachtingpublished footage of the testing earlier this week:Jeff Bezos’s 127m/ 417ft Sailing Yacht Koru having a first day of sea trialsKoru had a controversial start in life after Oceanco petitioned the Rotterdam government for the ability to dismantle a historic bridge in order to get the yacht to open water.
The city council in Rotterdam vowed never allow another dismantling of the Koningshavenbrug bridge, however, after it came down for a during renovations in 2017.
Known locally as De Hef, the bridge was heavily damaged by Nazi shelling in WWII but managed to survive.
It became a symbol for local resistance against the invading forces.When news spread that the bridge might need to be dismantled, angry Dutch people responded by vowing to launch eggs at the yacht as it passed through town.

The story added the board's belief that Snyder "is unfit to run a concession stand, let alone one of the region's marquee professional sports teams.

In case you forgot, billionaire Jeff Bezos is George Strait's cousinNewsSportsHookem.comAustin360OpinionAdvertiseObituarieseNewspaperLegalsSubscribeENTERTAINMENTIn case you forgot, Jeff Bezos is still George Strait's cousinElla Malena FeldmanAustin 360Jeff Bezos has been making headlines lately.
After landing ahistoric spaceflightwith his aerospace company, Blue Origin, in West Texas, the billionaireoffered NASA a $2 billion incentiveto include a human landing system made by Blue Origin as part of plans to return to the moon.
He's alsobeen widely criticizedfor using his wealth to galavant into space while problems — including wealth inequality, labor disputes at Amazon (the company he founded) and a pandemic — continue to roil here on Earth.But today, we're bringing you a headline that has nothing to to do with any of this, a headline that may surprise you more than the rest.
Bezos is related to a man who also has had a titanic cultural impact on American society: King George himself.That's right — Bezos and beloved country singer George Strait are cousins.The American-Statesmanfirst wrote about this innocuous yet fascinating factback in 2018, when Bezos was considering Austin as the location for Amazon HQ2.
Since then, the good people over atTaste of Countryhave brought a bit more clarity to the situation.Fora 2020 article, the country news publication did some digging to figure out exactly how the two men are related.
UsingFind a Grave, which is owned by Ancestry.com, they found quite a few degrees of separation between them: "Strait and Bezos' mother, Jacklyn Gise, are second cousins, making Strait's son, Bubba, third cousins to Jeff Bezos," Billy Dukes wrote.
If there is a term for how Strait and Bezos are directly related, it's not clear — perhaps cousins twice removed?
So, why have the two men never publicly acknowledged each other?
Did Strait make a joke about the shape ofBezos's rocket ship?
Was Bezos caught flirting with one of the numerous exes Strait purportedly has scattered across the state of Texas?Probably not.
The most likely explanation seems to be that they're just too distantly related to really be family.
Still, it's fun to entertain.CareersStaff DirectoryAccessibilitySite MapLegalsOur Ethical PrinciplesSubscription Terms & ConditionsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact UsSupport Local BusinessAdvertise Your BusinessAdvertising Terms and ConditionsPromote your EventLicensing & ReprintsAustin American-Statesman StoreHelp CenterSubscriber GuideMy AccountGive FeedbackPromote Your EventSubscribe TodayNewslettersFacebookTwitterInstagrameNewspaperArchivesJobsCarsHomesClassifiedsReviewed.com10BestLocaliQ Digital Marketing SolutionsEventsUSA TODAY Sports+© 2023 www.statesman.com.

My mind is blown.First of all I have to tell you that I grew up with a mother that believes in the cousins (once removed/twice removed etc).
Not everyone understands it but it really is a way of measuring your relation to people.
For example, what is the relationship between my first cousin Renee and my daughter Emily.
They are first cousins once removed.
My daughter Emily is second cousins with Renee’s daughter Natalie.
Follow me?So according to Ancestry via Taste of Country,  George Strait and Bezos mother, Jacklyn Gise are second cousins.
That makes George and Jeff second cousins once removed.
At least I think.This would make for one interesting family reunion.
Wonder if George is in the will or maybe it’s the other way around.
Both men have done pretty well for themselves.
Might be something in the genes!

Austin is one of them.
Dallas is the other.More:From education to transportation to cost of living, weighing the impact Amazon’s HQ2 could have on Austin -- and its peopleBut, as  theDallas Morning News pointed out back in Sept. 2017,there is a Texas connection to Bezos that some might have missed: King George himself.Related:Trump goes after Amazon — again — over postal deliveryYeah, you read that right.
I didn’t know this either, and only found out while doing someGeorge Strait research for another article.
But, as the DMN says:Bezos spent 10 hot summers on his grandfather's cattle ranch in Cotulla, Texas, and his cousin is country singer George Strait.An earlier DMN article from 1997 details the New Mexico-born Bezos’ time spent in Houston, where he lived as a child after his stepfather’s work with Exxon brought the family to Texas.Related:Amazon backlash?
In Austin, many are ‘meh’ over HQ2 pursuitAccording to Wikipedia, sourcing the 2017 DMN blog, Bezos’ tie to Strait is through his maternal grandmother, Mattie Louise Gise (née Strait).It seems neither strait nor Bezos have publicly commented on each other’s careers for some time (or, if they have, it’s hard to find).More:George Strait says country music is ‘trending towards traditional’As of right now, Amazon’s HQ2 location has still not been announced.CareersStaff DirectoryAccessibilitySite MapLegalsOur Ethical PrinciplesSubscription Terms & ConditionsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact UsSupport Local BusinessAdvertise Your BusinessAdvertising Terms and ConditionsPromote your EventLicensing & ReprintsAustin American-Statesman StoreHelp CenterSubscriber GuideMy AccountGive FeedbackPromote Your EventSubscribe TodayNewslettersFacebookTwitterInstagrameNewspaperArchivesJobsCarsHomesClassifiedsReviewed.com10BestLocaliQ Digital Marketing SolutionsEventsUSA TODAY Sports+© 2023 www.statesman.com.

And if so, how come neither the country star nor the Amazon founder has talked about one another publicly?It's a complicated exploration in genealogy, but the summary is simple.News that Bezos and Strait are related traces back a few years, to aDallas Morning Newsarticle that nonchalantly describes them as "cousins."
In 2019, theHouston Chroniclegoes deeper explaining that Bezos' maternal grandmother is Strait's cousin.
That's not quite true either, but it's closer.We did some digging at Find a Grave (owned by Ancestry.com) to get to the heart of the matter and learned that Strait and Bezos' mother, Jacklyn Gise, are second cousins, making Strait's son, Bubba, third cousins to Jeff Bezos.
If there is a term for how Strait and Bezos are directly related, it's not clear — perhaps cousins twice removed?A neat and tidy (if amateurish) graphic below explains it all, but the synopsis is that Strait's great-grandfather John Joseph Strait bore sons John Samuel (Strait's grandfather) and Yancey Clarance (plus four other children, perFind a Grave).
John Samuel would father John Byron, who is George Strait's dad.Yancey Clarence would father a daughter named Mattie Strait, whowould marry Lawrence Preston Giseand give birth to Jacklyn Gise, who gave birth to Jeff.
Jeff was actually born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen (perCNBC), but his father was a deadbeat dad and his mother (who became pregnant at age 16) remarried Miguel Bezos in 1968.
Bezos then adopted Jeffrey when the boy was four years old.George Strait Jeff Bezos RelatedTaste of Countryloading...While it's tempting to believe some sort of family rift separates Strait from Bezos, a more likely explanation is the relationship is just too loose to foster.
Think about it: How well do you know grandpa's brother's kids, let alone your grandpa's brother's great-grandchildren?Strait and Bezos are "cousins" in the mostly loosely defined ways — the Country Music Hall of Famer may be fewer degrees of separation away from Kevin Bacon than the richest man on the planet, but that's a study for another day.One last thought about the legitimacy of Find a Grave as a research tool: A long, but detailed exploration atMediumshows the site is a sort of Wikipedia for the dead.
It's user-generated, but those who participate are very dedicated and thorough.
There are fewer checks and balances than at Wikipedia (the days of Wiki being embarrassingly unreliable are long gone), but the community nature of it all means that you can likely count on the broad strokes details in this case.
Being owned by Ancestry.com also gives the site some legitimacy, but Ancestry does make mention that they claim no legal responsibility for the accuracy.Here's Why George Strait Stopped Doing Interviews:22 Too-Sweet Picture of George Strait + Wife Norma:Filed Under:George StraitCategories:Country Music News,Original FeaturesCommentsLeave A CommentMore From Taste of CountryGeorge Strait Announces Two New Shows in His Home State of TexasGeorge Strait Announces Two New Shows in His Home State of Texas10 Times the CMT Music Awards Got It Wrong10 Times the CMT Music Awards Got It WrongGeorge Strait Surprises Crowd at Bruce Springsteen Show in Texas [Watch]George Strait Surprises Crowd at Bruce Springsteen Show in Texas [Watch]Alan Jackson, Shania Twain, Kenny Rogers Among World’s Top Old-School Country Artists, Study FindsAlan Jackson, Shania Twain, Kenny Rogers Among World’s Top Old-School Country Artists, Study FindsGeorge Strait Blasts Off Into Space — With Snacks — in H-E-B Grocery Super Bowl Ad [Watch]George Strait Blasts Off Into Space — With Snacks — in H-E-B Grocery Super Bowl Ad [Watch]15 Country Legends Who Deserve to Be in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame15 Country Legends Who Deserve to Be in the Rock & Roll Hall of FameBlake Shelton Opens up About Cutting Back on TouringBlake Shelton Opens up About Cutting Back on TouringGeorge Strait Raises a Record $2.4 Million for Veterans at Benefit ShowGeorge Strait Raises a Record $2.4 Million for Veterans at Benefit ShowTim McGraw Shares Joyful Cover of George Strait’s ‘Christmas Cookies’ [Watch]Tim McGraw Shares Joyful Cover of George Strait’s ‘Christmas Cookies’ [Watch]InformationContact UsPrivacyAdvertiseExercise My Data RightsMobile AppFollow UsVisit us on YoutubeVisit us on FacebookVisit us on Twitter2023Taste of Country, Townsquare Media, Inc.

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A childhood dream was fulfilled on Tuesday as 82-year-old astronaut Wally Funk blasted off with Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos.Lift off: Blue Origin’s Bezos becomes latest billionaire in spaceRiding his own rocket, Bezos launched into space on a thrilling 10-minute up-and-down flight.
And Funk, who made history with him, has a family connection back on Earth, in Memphis.Memphis etiquette and protocol expert Sally Shy personally knows Wally Funk.
The aviation trailblazer who just happens to be Shy’s first cousin by marriage.“From the moment I met Wally 50 years ago, she has told me she always wanted to go,” said Shy.
She’s fabulous.
I’m so proud to be able to say even though she’s not a blood cousin, she’s my late husband’s first cousin.”Shy showed WREG photos of Funk with her family throughout the years.
She said they just talked on the phone Thursday about space, and things more down to earth.Sally Shy watches the launch on her phone in Memphis.Wally Funk and Sally ShyWally Funk (submitted photo)Wally Funk (submitted photo)Wally Funk, right, describes their flight experience as Mark Bezos, left, and Jeff Bezos, left, center, founder of Amazon and space tourism company Blue Origin, applaud from the spaceport near Van Horn, Texas, Tuesday, July 20, 2021.
AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez)Related ContentBlue Origin auctions first seat on crewed space flight …“We talked for about a half an hour laughing, giggling, and saying how fabulous it was that she was going to do this, and then she said, ‘Do you still have that album of mother’s 90th birthday and could you send it to me?’ I said I’ll do that very thing,” said Shy.Days later, the next thing Funk did was travel to space.“I sat there with tears all morning just watching her.
I cried when she went up.
I cried when the capsule separated, and I cried when she came down,” said Shy.They were tears of joy because she knew her cousin had trained to become an astronaut, but her dreams were dashed because of gender and age.“When the gender was allowed to go up into space, she was too old.
So, she missed it for being a female and missed it for being too old until along came Jeff Bezos, our hero,” said Shy.Bezos wanted Funk to be on board this flight becoming the oldest person to ever fly to space.
Sally Shy says her cousin is showing the world you’re never too old to aim for the stars.“I am so proud of her.
That shows what patience and determination can do,” said Shy.Shy says Bezos and others probably had a hard time trying to keep up with her cousin, because at 82, she has more energy than most people.Close ModalSuggest a CorrectionYour name(required)Your email(required)Report a typo or grammatical error(required)SubmitΔSuggest a CorrectionCopyright 2023 Nexstar Media Inc.

You may know him as the founder of Amazon, the largest retailer in the world.
His name?
This extraordinary man goes by the name of none other than, Jeffrey Preston Bezos.
We have come to know him as someone who has changed the way we shop forever, he continues to show us new ways to push the envelope and change the modern world.
Who would have known the son of a teen mother would have become the man he is today.
He was introduced to the world on January 12, 1964 in Albuquerque New Mexico.
He was conceived by Jacklyn Bezos and her husband Ted Jorgensen.Years later, his mother married Miguel Bezos, a Cuban immigrant.
This is where Jeff got the well known last name of Bezos.
He attended Princeton University where he got his degree in electrical engineering and computer science.
After graduating in 1986, Bezos went to Wall Street where he found a successful job.
Not long after, he found himself, beheld with an idea that would change his life forever.
That idea was Amazon.
With the success his company brought him, he has found many ways to use his influence for the betterment of others, becoming a hero to many.
A hero contains many traits.
A few being, determination, resilience, passion, and care.
Jeff Bezos is a modern day hero because of his unconditional care for others and his unbreakable determination.Jeff Bezos in his determined state of mindtheverge.comJeff Bezos has furthered his title as a modern day hero through his immense determination that has made him a fearless entrepreneur and innovator.
His determination was proven to be useful as he struggled to make a decision to quit his Wall Street job to pursue his dream.
Seen in the light, it was a really difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot.
I didn’t think I’d regret trying and failing.
And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all”(Catherine Clifford para.
18) said Bezos.
He was fixed with the decision to quit and pursue his dream or sit there and and watch it fade.
But after seeing that Web usage had been growing by 2,300% a year, Bezos knew he had to do something about it.
Bezos was able pursue his dream of Amazon because of his determination to start something new and his propensity to not fear failure.
Bezos’ determination doesn’t stop there.
When seem promoting his company, he is industriously trying to grow his company and spread the word of Amazon.
Analytical and Methodical, Bezos is also enthusiastic and tireless in promoting his company and the potential of the internet to change the way people buy”(Business Leader Profiles for Students para.3).
Jeff Bezos shows his determination through his love and desire for his company.
The amount of time and effort he has put forth for his company inspires all.
His non-stop promoting, eagerness to change the way people shop, and his desire to be the best all stemmed from the eternal flame fueling his vision.
It is through his heroic acts of determination and resilience that he inspires the youth to do more, and be more while simultaneously changing the world, furthering his status of hero.from a relentless boss to kind hearted manbusinessinsider.comJeff Bezos also demonstrates his unconditional desire for helping others as another one of his heroic abilities that makes him such an influential figure in today’s society.
His willingness to try new things in order for them to have a positive effect on others has led him to his upcoming philanthropy plan, “As hard as it might be, reducing healthcare’s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort”(Jeff Bezos Biography.com-Entrepreneur, Business Leader para.22).
While having less of an effect on the economy, Jeff Bezos’ philanthropy plan is aimed to help others in desperate need of health care.
In doing so he uses the platform he has created to provide benefits for those who can’t support themselves.
This exemplifies his caring nature in many ways, but the main reason is the fact he puts aside his own needs only to benefit others.
A similar scenario in which Bezos exhibits his aide to society is one he takes across the globe.
...In early 2016, he flew his personal jet to Germany to pick up and bring home the Washington Post reporter who had been detained by Iran”(Avery Hartmans para.
32) Avery Hartman wrote.
His efforts to reach this reporter were extensive.
But without a shadow of a doubt, he was going to go retrieve the reporter.
Bezos wasn’t obligated to go get him, no one was.
But he did anyways.
If it wasn’t for Bezos, who knows what could have happened to that reporter.
As demonstrated by Bezos, kindness and giving back can go a long way, literally.
Through Jeff Bezos’ dearest efforts, he has been a quintessential example of how to treat others in a caring manner; putting society on a path toward great things.To conclude, Jeff Bezos, in many ways, has shown us what it is like to be a modern day hero.
Whether it was through his determination or his concern for others, he has demonstrated many acts of one.
Ranging from a decision to create a startup company to flying his private jet to pick up a detained news reporter.
What astonishes me despite all his success is that “Amazon founder Jeff Bezos went from the son of a teen mom to the world's richest person, his wealth topping $105 billion”(Catherine Clifford-cnbc article title).
He is living proof that extraordinary things can happen no matter the life you’re born into.
Whether you’re born into a poor childhood or a wealthy one, there is a chance.
A chance to do good.
Bezos had a dream and he executed, leaving a huge imprint in the 21st century.
Through his determination to change the world and his unconditional desire to help others, he will forever serve as a hero.
As an inspiration for future generations, Jeff Bezos has and will keep innovating, continuing to demonstrate his many of his heroic attributes and changing the lives of many along the way.Works CitedAu-Yeung, Angel.

      Bezos (pronounced bay-zohs), founder, chief executive office (CEO), and
      head cheerleader forAmazon.com, the Internet bookselling company he founded in 1995.
With about $1
      million in capital, most borrowed from friends and family, Bezos built a
      multibillion-dollar empire in about five years and in doing so,
      revolutionized the way commerce is done on the Internet.Childhood YearsJeffrey Preston Bezos was born January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New
      Mexico.
A year later, his parents divorced and since then he has never had
      contact with his biological father.
Three years later, his mother, Jackie
      Gise, married Michael Bezos, who fled his native Cuba when he was fifteen
      years old.
In early 1996 we were called Amazon.con, in '97
        Amazon.toast, and in 1999 it was Amazon.bomb.
Then there was my personal
        favorite:Amazon.org, because clearly we're not for profit.… It still gets a
        ton of attention.
I mean, you're still talking to me.
Much of Jeff Bezos's relentless drive and ambition likely came from
      his new father, who was raised in a Catholic mission.
Mike Bezos always
      strove to better himself, learning English
       and working various odd jobs to pay for his education at the University
      of New Mexico at Albuquerque.
After college, he became an engineer with
      Exxon Corporation, causing the family to move to Texas.
After several
      years, another job transfer brought them to Florida, where Jeff Bezos
      attended Palmetto High School in Miami.
Bezos was popular in school and
      became class president and valedictorian in his senior year.Early InnovatorBezos always had a knack for figuring out how things work.
InJeff Bezos: King of Amazon,author Josepha Sherman writes, "From the time he was a toddler,
      Bezos was busy trying to change his world.
He felt he was too old to sleep
      in a 'baby' crib, so he found a screwdriver and took the
      crib apart.
Instead of getting mad, Bezos's family encouraged
      him.
Bezos had a younger sister, Christina, and brother, Mark.
When the young
      siblings learned to walk, they loved going into their brother's
      room because of all the fascinating "toys".
To warn him that
      the children were coming, Jeff attached an alarm to his bedroom door that
      made a loud buzzing sound when someone entered.When Bezos was twelve he wanted something called an Infinity Cube.
The
      device was a set of small motorized mirrors that reflected off one another
      so the images seemed to go on endlessly.
It cost $20 but Bezos did not
      have enough money to buy it.
Instead, he purchased mirrors and other parts
      with what money he had and constructed his own reflecting cube.
He built
      other inventions, including amateur robots.
At one point he had so much
      clutter in his bedroom, his parents made him move all of his half-finished
      devices and experiments into the garage.There are many similar stories surrounding Bezos's childhood years.
      He spent countless hours building models and an assortment of electronics
      kits.
He worked on science projects, often coming up with his own
      "inventions."
By the time he reached high school, he had
      turned the family garage into his personal science and electronics
      laboratory.
Ironically, Bezos later would launchAmazon.comfrom his own garage.Enters PrincetonAfter graduating with honors from high school, Bezos decided to follow in
      the footsteps of Stephen Hawking and enroll in the physics program at
      Princeton University.
He soon realized, however, that the subject was too
      difficult for him, so he switched to a double major in electronics and
      computer science.
Bezos discovered he excelled at creating software
      programs.
In 1986, he graduated with highest honors and Phi Beta Kappa
      (membership in a national honor society), earning degrees in electrical
      engineering and the still new field of computer science.Bezos turned down several job offers from large corporations and instead
      took a position with a newly formed fiber optic company, Fitel.
His task
      was to help the company build a computer network specifically for
      international finance.
In 1988, he took a job developing systems for
      managing investment funds at Banker's Trust in New York City.
After
      two years, he moved to the Wall Street investment firm of D. E. Shaw
      & Company as a computer specialist.
In 1992, at age twenty-eight,
      he became Shaw's youngest ever vice president; two years later he
      was promoted to senior vice president.Bezos and DisneyAt various times, Jeff Bezos dreamed of becoming a cowboy or an
        astronaut.
He was a devotedStar Trekfan and went as far as naming his dog Kamala after a minor character
        from an episode ofStar Trek: The Next Generation.His heroesincluded American inventor Thomas Edison(1847-1931), astrophysicist Stephen Hawking (1942-), andWalt Disney(see entry), although he was no Mickey Mouse fan.
Instead, he was
        fascinated with how Disney came up with the electronics and animatronics
        used in Disney World in Orlando, Florida.
The thing that always amazed me [about Disney] was how powerful
        his vision was," Bezos said in aTimearticle.
He knew exactly what he wanted to build and teamed up
        with a bunch of really smart people and built it.
Everyone thought it
        wouldn't work, and he had to persuade the banks to lend him $400
        million.
But he did it."
Many friendsandfamily members would likely say the same thing about Bezos and the way
        he tookAmazon.comfrom an idea to a multibillion-dollar enterprise.
Bezos, however, did
        it much quicker than Disney.From Idea to RealityWhile at Shaw Bezos developed the idea that would eventually becomeAmazon.com.
In 1994, he read an article about how the World Wide Web was growing by
      2,300 percent a year.
He knew he had to tap into such a great potential
      for commerce but was unsure what type of business would work
       best.
He researched mail-order companies, believing their products would
      sell well on the Internet.
After drawing up a list of twenty popular
      mail-order items, Bezos finally settled on books since the millions of
      titles in print offered an enormous potential for sales.On July 6,1995, Bezos launchedAmazon.com, named after the South American river, with financial and moral support
      from family and friends.
The company operated out of the garage of the
      Bezos's two-bedroom home in suburban Seattle, Washington.
With
      almost no publicity, sales took off immediately.
Within the first
      few days, I knew this was going to be huge," Bezos toldTime.
It was obvious that we were onto something much bigger than we
      ever dared to hope.
Person of the YearBy the end of 1999,Amazon.comhad become a multibillion-dollar corporation offering 3.5 million titles
      for sale.
It had expanded into a variety of other merchandise, including
      music and videos, and had set up operations in Europe.
Bezos's
      personal fortune alone was estimated at $10.5 billion.
In the crowning
      achievement of his career,Timemagazine named Bezos its "Person of the Year" for 1999,
      proclaiming him king of cybercommerce.With success came adversity.
The company became involved in several
      notable lawsuits filed by Barnes & Noble and Wal-Mart.
But none of
      the problems compared to the biggest challenge of all: making the company
      profitable.Amazon.comlost money every year, including $1.4 billion in 2000.
In 2001, the
      company laid off thirteen hundred workers and instituted other
      cost-cutting measures.
The belt-tightening worked andAmazon.composted its first ever net profit of $5.1 million for the fourth quarter
      of 2001.Despite his hectic schedule, the head of the world's largest
        bookstore still finds time to read.
Jeff Bezos buys about ten books a
        month although he reads only three.
His favorites includeThe Remains of the Dayby Kazuo Ishiguro,Duneby Frank Herbert, andBuilt to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companiesby James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras.For the future, Bezos plans to makeAmazon.coma place people can buy anything they want on-line.
And now that theCEO and founder Jeff Bezos is known for his sunny disposition and
            booming laugh.Reproduced by permission of the Corbis Corporation (Bellevue).company is firmly rooted, Bezos and his wife MacKenzie want to turn their
      attention to charitable work.
At some point, we want to figure out
      how to do philanthropic work that's highly leveraged," said
      Bezos.
It's very easy to give away money ineffectively.
But
      doing it well requires at least as much attention and energy as building a
      successful company.

He was born the son of a 16-year-old mom and deadbeat dad.
And he didn't set out to be the CEO of an e-commerce juggernaut.Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff BezosPhoto by Bloomberg"I won the lottery with my mom.
Thanks for literally everything, Mom"Jeff Bezos was born on January 12, 1964, as Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen.
His biological dad, Ted Jorgensen, met and started dating his mother, Jacklyn Gise, when they were both in high school.
Jorgensen was 18 and Gise was 16 when she became pregnant.
They flew to Mexico with their parents' money to get married.Jorgensen belonged to a unicycle troupe and worked at a retail store making $1.25 an hour, so he didn't have much money.
He was also "had a habit of drinking too much," according to"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon," by journalist and biographer Brad Stone.
When Jeff Bezos was 17 months old, his mom divorced Jorgensen.In 1968, Gise remarried Miguel Bezos, who arrived in Miami in 1962 from Cuba knowing only one word of English: "hamburger."
Jorgensen agreed to let Bezos adopt his son and, at 4 years old, Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen became Jeffrey Preston Bezos.Biographer Stone suggests that Bezos' childhood may have contributed to his obsession with success.
It is of course unknowable whether the unusual circumstances of his birth helped to create that fecund entrepreneurial mix of intelligence, ambition, and a relentless need to prove himself.
Two other technology icons, Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison, were adopted, and the experience is thought by some to have given each a powerful motivation to succeed," Stone writes.Growing up, Bezos spent summers with his grandparents on their Texas ranch,he says in the commencement speechhe gave at Princeton in 2010.
I helped fix windmills, vaccinate cattle, and do other chores.
We also watched soap operas every afternoon, especially 'Days of our Lives,'" says Bezos.Bezos would also occasionally get to road trip with his grandparents.
My grandparents belonged to a Caravan Club, a group of Airstream trailer owners who travel together around the U.S. and Canada.
And every few summers, we'd join the caravan,"Bezos says in graduation speech.
We'd hitch up the Airstream trailer to my grandfather's car, and off we'd go, in a line with 300 other Airstream adventurers.
I loved and worshipped my grandparents and I really looked forward to these trips.
Launching Amazon: "I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice"Bezos got straight As in high school, was the valedictorian of his class and was accepted early admission to Princeton, according to Stone's biography.
For a time in college,he thought he would be a theoretical physicist.But it was years later, while working in finance in New York City that he had the idea to start Amazon.
I came across the fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year.
I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles — something that simply couldn't exist in the physical world — was very exciting to me," says Bezos, in his 2010 Princeton address.At the time, Bezos was just 30 and had been married for a year.
I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go do this crazy thing that probably wouldn't work since most startups don't, and I wasn't sure what would happen after that," he says.After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.Jeff Bezosfounder of Amazon, Blue OriginHis wife told him to go for it.
As a young boy,I'd been a garage inventor.
I'd invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker that didn't work very well out of an umbrella and tinfoil, baking-pan alarms to entrap my siblings," he says.
I'd always wanted to be an inventor, and she wanted me to follow my passion.
But not everyone was on board.
Bezos boss took a walk through Central Park and told Bezos that, while it sounded like a "really good idea," it would be an even better idea for somebody who didn't already have a good career.
That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision,"says Bezos.
Seen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot.
I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing.
And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all.
After much consideration,I took the less safe pathto follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.
The early days of Amazon: "I thought maybe one day we would be able to afford a forklift"When Amazon first started, it sold only books.
Bezos would drive the packages to the post office himselfin his 1987 Chevy Blazer.
I thought maybe one day we would be able to afford a forklift,"Bezos tells Charlie Rosein a wide-ranging interview in 2016.
And it is very, it's very, very different today.
After books, the next items Bezos added to Amazon were music and videos.
Then, he asked customers to see what else they would want to buy from the online retailer.
I sent an email message out to the customer base, actually a thousand randomly selected customers, and I said, besides books, music and video, what would you like to see us sell?
And the list came back incredibly long," explains Bezos.
It was basically just whatever the person had on their mind right now," says Bezos, and that sparked an idea.VIDEO1:0501:05Here's what makes up the Jeff Bezos empireThe Definitive Guide to Business"One of customers said, 'I wish you sold windshield wipers because I need windshield wipers for my car.'
A light kind of went on in my head.
You know, people — people will want to use this new fangled e-commerce way of shopping for everything,"Bezos says to Rose.
People are very convenience-motivated," says Bezos.
So that really started the kind of the expansion into all categories, consumer electronics, and then apparel, and so on.
Expand he did.
Today, Amazon sells almost everything.
From toilet paperto groceriesto electronics to fashion to furniture.When Bezos enters a new product category, he is not intimidated by a lack of expertise.
I am never disappointed when we're not good at something because I think, well think how good it's going to work when we are good at it,"Bezos tells Rose.
And the apparel is like that.
There is so much opportunity.
Nobody really knows how to do a great job of offering — apparel online yet.
And we have tons of invention and ideas and working our way through that experimental list.
Amazon's North star: "Customer obsession, as opposed to competitor obsession"Bezos has always been a rare combination of optimistic, idealistic and visionary.Back in 2003, while much of the tech industry was still hungover from the dot-com bust, Bezos was aggressively foretelling the potential of the Internet.
I do think there's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us,"says Bezos in a TED Talkhe gave that year.
We're very, very early.
As Bezos charged full force into the Wild West that was the Internet then, he was — and still is today — guided by a single belief: Do what is best for the customer.
Thing that connects everything that Amazon does is the number one — our number one conviction and idea and philosophy and principle which is customer obsession, as opposed to competitor obsession.
And so we are always focused on the customer, working backwards from the customer's needs, developing new skills internally so that we can satisfy what we perceive to be future customer needs,"Bezos tells Rose.Another through line to Bezos' business strategy is his "willingness to think long-term," he says.
We are very happy to invest in new initiatives that are very risky, for five to seven years, which most companies won't do that,"Bezos tells Rose.
It's the combination of the risk-taking and the long-term outlook that make Amazon, not unique, but special in a smaller crowd.
Finally, he's obsessive about finding problems and fixing them.
Taking real pride in operational excellence, so just doing things well, finding defects and working backwards — that is all the incremental improvement that in business, most successful companies are very good at this one.
... [Y]ou don't want to ever let defects flow downstream,"Bezos says to Rose.
That is a key part of doing a good job in any business in my opinion.
VIDEO0:5100:51The evolution of Jeff Bezos: See if you can recognize him through the yearsDigital OriginalFrom e-commerce to mediaAs consumer behavior on the web has evolved, so, too has Amazon.
Prime, the e-commerce's populartwo-day shipping membershipcomes with access to premium television shows, for example.Being a content creator built on the back of an e-commerce giant gives Amazon freedom to be creative.
For example, one of Amazon's most popular shows, "Transparent," is about a patriarch who becomes a woman later in life.
It's won eight Emmys and beennominated for another 28.
A show like 'Transparent' which has won Golden Globes and Emmys is not ever — it is not a show that could be successfully done on broadcast TV, because broadcast TV needs a much bigger audience,"says Bezos to Rose.
And so you can actually think about the creative process a little differently.
You can attract different storytellers.
You can go for stories that are narrower but incredibly powerful and well told.
In addition to producing online shows, Bezos is also the owner of another kind of content: journalism.
Through his Nash Holdings LLC, hebought the Washington Postin 2013 for $250 million.
I bought it because it's important," says Bezos.
I would never buy a financially upside down salty snack food company.
You know, that doesn't make any sense to me.
But The Washington Post is important.
And so it makes sense to me to take something like that, and I also am optimistic.
And I thought there were some ways to make it — I want it to be a self-sustaining, profitable enterprise," Bezos says to Rose.
And I think it can be done.
Bezos' empire now stretches far and wide.
Amazon, which currently has amarket cap of more than $500 billion,bought Whole Foods in Augustand also owns companies like Zappos and Twitch.
ThroughBezos Expeditions, he's also invested in companies like Twitter and Basecamp,among many others.The final frontier: "I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5"While shipping toiletries and downloading books hasmade Bezos wealthy, his passion is outer space.Buzz Aldrin dropped by Blue Origin HQ to say hi to the team yesterday.
This is a childhood dream,"Bezos says to Rose.
I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5 years old.
I watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon.
You don't choose your passions, your passions choose you.
So I am infected with this idea.
I couldn't ever stop thinking about space.
I have been thinking about it ever since then.
To that end, Bezos is the founder ofBlue Origin, a company that aims tomake space tourism affordable.
Basically what I am doing right now is taking my Amazon winnings and investing them.
Every time you see me sell stock on Amazon, it's send more money to the Blue Origin team,"Bezos says to Rose.In addition to making it possible for more people to travel to space, Bezos says he is building the infrastructure for the next generation of space entrepreneurs.
I]f I'm 80 years old, looking back on my life and the one thing I have done is make it so that there is this gigantic entrepreneurial explosion in space for the next generation," says Bezos, "I will be a happy, happy man.

Jeff Bezos: Life Story, Bio and FactsELEVATESOCIETYAboutElevating KnowledgeElevating GoalsElevating BooksElevating IdeasJeff Bezos: Life Story, Bio and FactsEarly Life, Struggles, and Road to SuccessThe impact of a single stroke of genius can be immeasurable.Take the case of Jeff Bezos, the founder ofAmazon.com, who started an online bookstore in his garage and forever changed the way we buy just about everything.LEARN MOREBezos is a true pioneer who sees opportunities on the horizon and takes risks to get ahead of the trends.Early Interests and InitiativeJeffrey Preston Bezos was born to a ranch family in Albuquerque, New Mexico on January 12, 1964.
Jeff’s mother, who was a teenager when he was born, only remained with his father for about a year, then remarried Miguel Bezos, a Cuban immigrant who had come to the U.S. by himself when he was 15, working his way through the university to become an engineer for Exxon.Jeff Bezos showed a precocious interest in engineering himself, tinkering with things around the house, even turning his parents’ garage into a sort of laboratory.
He pursued his passion for science and technology while in high school, attending the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida.
He also started his first business in high school: the Dream Institute, a summer enrichment camp for grade-schoolers.After turning briefly to physics in his undergraduate studies, Bezos committed to his love for computers and went on to earn his degree from Princeton in electrical engineering and computer science.After college, he took a job on Wall Street that allowed him to still be involved in the field of computer science.
He quickly established a high-paying career for himself in finance.But once again, his lifelong curiosity would draw him back into the world of technology.
He left his lucrative job and went headlong in pursuit of his inspired start-up vision: he saw the opening for e-commerce in the rapid development of the Internet, along with recent changes in tax regulation, and he came up with an idea to take advantage of these profitable conditions.He didn’t waste any time, either.
Bezos wrote the business plan for the online bookstore we now know as Amazon while making the cross-country trip from New York to Seattle, where he would start his new company in his garage.Amazon and BeyondWith only a few employees, Bezos started developing software in his own home.
After having his friends beta test the site, he launched Amazon.com on July 16, 1995.It was an instant success.
In the first few weeks of its existence, with no promotional budget, Amazon grossed $20,000 in international book sales, a faster growth than Bezos himself had imagined.When Amazon went public in 1997, Bezos faced doubts about whether the company could compete with established retailers once they too went online.
But Amazon had changed the game and continued to lead.What set Amazon apart from other companies during the dot.com bust was its versatility: Bezos repeated his model for book sales with CDs and videos, then with apparel, electronics, and other items, turning Amazon into a one-stop shop by partnering with more and more retailers.In 2011, Amazon saw a 70% growth and was valued at over $17 billion.The net worth of Jeff Bezos is estimated in the billions as well, but he’s not simply accumulating wealth.
Instead of paying himself the typical CEO-sized salary, he invests in the next big innovation.In 2006, he announced that he had founded a human spaceflight startup, Blue Origin, with plans to make space exploration widely available.
He is also venturing into what he calls the “uncharted terrain” of online journalism with his purchase in 2013 of the Washington Post.
Again, Bezos is taking the lead by taking the risks that will adapt the marketplace.Success in New Ideas, Not NumbersIn 2014, Jeff Bezos ranked 17th on the list of wealthiest people in the world.
But this statistic is not the right measure for his success.If Bezos were driven to be successful by making money, Amazon would probably not exist, at least not as we know it today, because he might not have risked his wealthy lifestyle for the chance to start something new, from the ground up—and not just a new business, but a new way of doing business.If personal wealth was what Bezos was after, he could simply let Amazon run its course and collect the profits, instead of investing in new possibilities, reinvigorating the news and space industries through adaptive innovation.Bezos recognizes possibilities within emerging conditions and takes action for the sake of these possibilities.
Although his story is filled with impressive numbers, its theme is putting new ideas into practice.

You earn reputation by trying to do hard things well.
What we need to do is always lean into the future; when the world changes around you and when it changes against you - what used to be a tail wind is now a head wind - you have to lean into that and figure out what to do because complaining isn't a strategy.
What's dangerous is not to evolve.
I think frugality drives innovation, just like other constraints do.
One of the only ways to get out of a tight box is to invent your way out.
The human brain is an incredible pattern-matching machine.
If you only do things where you know the answer in advance, your company goes away.
We've had three big ideas at Amazon that we've stuck with for 18 years, and they're the reason we're successful: Put the customer first.
Invent.
And be patient.
There'll always be serendipity involved in discovery.
If you don't understand the details of your business you are going to fail.
A company shouldn't get addicted to being shiny, because shiny doesn't last.
Real estate is the key cost of physical retailers.
That's why there's the old saw: location, location, location.
Amazon.com strives to be the e-commerce destination where consumers can find and discover anything they want to buy online.
I have won this lottery.
It's a gigantic lottery, and it's called Amazon.com.
And I'm using my lottery winnings to push us a little further into space.
The key thing about a book is that you lose yourself in the author's world.
Life's too short to hang out with people who aren't resourceful.
The best customer service is if the customer doesn't need to call you, doesn't need to talk to you.
It just works.
If you do build a great experience, customers tell each other about that.
Word of mouth is very powerful.
If you're competitor-focused, you have to wait until there is a competitor doing something.
Being customer-focused allows you to be more pioneering.
It's not an experiment if you know it's going to work.
If you can't tolerate critics, don't do anything new or interesting.
The common question that gets asked in business is, 'why?'
That's a good question, but an equally valid question is, 'why not?
There are two ways to extend a business.
Take inventory of what you're good at and extend out from your skills.
Or determine what your customers need and work backward, even if it requires learning new skills.
Kindle is an example of working backward.
Humans are unbelievably data efficient.
You don't have to drive 1 million miles to drive a car, but the way we teach a self-driving car is have it drive a million miles.
If your customer base is aging with you, then eventually you are going to become obsolete or irrelevant.
You need to be constantly figuring out who are your new customers and what are you doing to stay forever young.

Van Horn, population about 2000, is the closest town to the launch site.
Van Horn being put on the map, it's exciting for some and there's some that are going to benefit economically from it," said Culberson County Sheriff Oscar Carillo.Most people on I-10 drive past Van Horn on the way to somewhere else.
But a crowd is expected in town for Tuesday's launch.
Van Horn is about 20 miles from where Bezos company Blue Origin operates a launch site in a remote area of West Texas.The facility is closed to the public and as close as the people can watch since Blue Origin asked TxDOT to close highway 54 nearby.Bezos’ company has been quietly operating here since 2000 and only recently put up a gleaming sign at the entrance of the launch site ahead of the first flight with people on board.
I don't think people realized what they were doing out there, north of here," said Carillo.ANGELA KOCHERGA / KTEP NEWSOscar Carillo is Sheriff of Culberson County which includes the region of West Texas where Jeff Bezos company Blue Origin has a launch site.Van Horn is a historic ranching town, about 120 miles east of El Paso.
North there's oil and gas, traditional foundations of the Texas economy.
But the region is now part of a modern-day private space race.Over the yeaers, Van Horn residents have figured out when there's a test flight.
We know something's brewing as many launches as they've had.
We see the influx of blue origin people coming in to support the launch," said Carillo.Some townspeople catch sight of a flight in the blue skies over the desert now and then.
Amy Morales has seen a few launches from the roof of the historic El Capitan Hotel where she's the assistant manager.But a few days before the human flight She was more excited about another event, the Jubilee, a reunion of graduates from Van Horn High School, home of the Eagles.
A lot of people do come back.
We have a good time.
It gets pretty crazy," said Morales.The reunion includes an ice cream social, a big dance and a chance to catch up with old friends who've moved away.
Like many struggling rural towns, young people leave for jobs in big cities.
We've been losing population.
The young kids graduate and hardly any of them come back.
The old timers are dying," said Culberson County Commissioner Gilda Morales.Morales moved back to take care of her aging parents.
The county commissioner is also  a nurse practitioner at the local clinic, editor of local paper and owns the Cactus Cantina and grill.
The  place is popular with locals "kind of like cheers where everybody knows your name," she said.ANGELA KOCHERGA / KTEP NEWSCulberson County Commissioner Gilda Morales also owns the Cactus Cantina and Grill in Van Horn.The cantina's small staff all have day jobs so it's only open in the evenings Thursday through Saturday and the occasional Sunday.
But there are extended hours leading up the Blue Origin launch.
She and other business owners expect an economic boost from the high profile flight that included auctioning off a seat on the rocket.
I think we have to pinch ourselves because you see it on tv and then you walk outside and hey that's happening here," Morales said.While grateful for the extra customers, she hopes the benefit goes beyond space tourism so more young people can build a future in their hometown.
If there are good paying jobs, maybe with Blue Origin, why not here?
Why leave for bigger towns?
ANGELA KOCHERGA / KTEP NEWSBlue Origin recently installed a sign at the entrance to the company’s launch site in far West Texas.Blue Origin has 275 employees in West Texas but the company did not specify how many live in Van Horn.
The company has 50 additional contractors on site providing support services.
They include catering, cleaning and maintenance services according to Morales.Blue Origin employees also mentor the robotics team and the company also helped add a college curriculum course to the schools according to the company.In place where people know their neighbors, Morales and others look forward to the opportunity to meet the elusive Bezos someday.
I'm sure he's a very nice guy but we don't see much of him.
I guess that goes with territory of being a billionaire, people hitting him up.
We just want to get to know him.For now, she and most local residents will have to settle for glimpse of Bezos face on a wall painted on a mural in town with a rocket blasting off behind him.
And that's too bad because I think he would like us," Morales said.This story originally appeared on KTEP.Today in Houston Newsletter SignupWe're in the process of transitioning services for our Today in Houston newsletter.

Now he's got a plan to colonize the planet.MALE NEWSREADER:Bezos is laying out his plans for colonizing space.FEMALE NEWSREADER:Bezos is known for going big, and now he's literally shooting for the moon.NARRATOR:In May of 2019, Jeff Bezos, the richest person on the planet, unveiled his latest invention.JEFF BEZOS:This is Blue Moon.
It’s time to go back to the moon, this time to stay.JOSHUA WEINSTEIN, Jeff Bezos’ friend:Jeff has said over and over again that the most important work he’s doing is work in space.
What he’s built with Amazon is really important and really interesting and it’s revolutionized commerce.
But it’s only revolutionized commerce.NARRATOR:Bezos’ plan is to chart a new course for the future of humanity.JEFF BEZOS:—manufactured worlds rotated to create artificial gravity with centrifugal force.
These are very large structures, miles on end.
And they hold a million people or more each.NARRATOR:It’s an idea he’s had since he was a teenager.JEFF BEZOS:This is me in high school.
And I want to highlight this quote: “The earth is finite, and if the world economy and population is to keep expanding, space is the only way to go.” I still believe that.CHRISTIAN DAVENPORT, The Washington Post:The way Jeff Bezos see is it is that consumerism is an example of how today’s society lives better than our parents did, and our grandparents, and he wants future generations to continue to have an increasingly better lifestyle.JEFF BEZOS:These are beautiful.
People are going to want to live here.NARRATOR:Bezos unveiled his extraterrestrial plans at a time of growing concern about the empire he’s built here on Earth.FEMALE NEWSREADER:Amazon is the great disrupter, from books to retail to grocery stores.NARRATOR:For more than 25 years, Jeff Bezos has been disrupting and transforming almost every aspect of our modern lives.AMY WEBB,CEO, Future Today Institute:Once you start connecting the dots, you see that Amazon is building all of the invisible infrastructure for our futures.FEMALE NEWSREADER:Amazon announced a health care partnership.MALE NEWSREADER:Amazon is helping the CIA build a secure cloud—CHARLIE ROSE, 60 Minutes:How much of the internet do you run?JEFF BEZOS:That’s a good question.
It’s a lot, though.NARRATOR:But in recent years, Amazon and Bezos have come under scrutiny for their aggressive tactics and expanding power.FRANKLIN FOER, The Atlantic:Everything that is admirable about Amazon is also something that we should fear about it.NARRATOR:For the past year, we’ve been investigating how Jeff Bezos built his empire and at what cost.JEFF BEZOS:And so think about this: Big things start small.NARRATOR:Jeff Bezos' empire has its roots not in Silicon Valley, but on Wall Street.
That's where the young Princeton graduate went to work in the early 1990s at a secretive hedge fund called D.E.
Shaw.ANDREAS WEIGEND,Former chief scientist, Amazon:David Shaw was the one revolutionized Wall Street by introducing data.
And I think Jeff really embraced that, that idea that, hey, if you have data, ultimately, you win.BRAD STONE,Author, "The Everything Store":One of the things that David Shaw asked Jeff Bezos to do was to go and investigate new businesses, and in particular this new thing in the early '90s called the World Wide Web.TOM BROKAW:We all know that a communications revolution is underway in this country—BRYANT GUMBEL:What is the internet?FEMALE GUEST:It’s sort of the mother of all networks.VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE:It’s an information highway.FEMALE TEEN:It’s kind of like your remote control to the world.NARRATOR:Bezos was quick to see the untapped potential of the new digital landscape and was determined to get in on it.JEFF BEZOS:I came across this startling statistic that web usage was growing at 2300% a year.
So I decided I would try and find a business plan that made sense in the context of that growth, and I picked books as the first best product to sell online.Because books are incredibly unusual in one respect, and that is that there are more items in the book category than there are items in any other category by far.
So when you have that many items you can literally build a store online that couldn’t exist any other way.NARRATOR:The store he was imagining didn’t exist, so he decided to build it himself.BRAD STONE:The reaction to Jeff's idea to start selling books on the internet was pretty incredulous from a lot of the people close to him.
His mom tried to convince him to just do it at night or over the weekends; she didn't want to see him give up his job.JOSHUA WEINSTEIN:Jeff called and he told me that he and MacKenzie were quitting their jobs and they were moving to Seattle and starting a company.
I said, "Great!
Well, what are you going to do?"
He said, "We’re going to sell books."
I said, "Nice."
He said, "On the internet."
I said, "Oh.
Jeff, why will anybody buy anything from you?"
And he said, "Well, we’re going to have more books than anybody else.
NARRATOR:One of the first names Bezos considered for his new website was Relentless.com.JAMES JACOBY, Correspondent:Why “relentless"?JOSHUA WEINSTEIN:Relentless meant "we move on no matter what."
He ultimately obviously decided that relentless wasn’t quite the right fit.
Amazon, Earth’s largest river, was.
Amazon means "gigantic.
JAMES JACOBY:In terms of relentlessness, of stopping at nothing, is that an apt description of Jeff?JOSHUA WEINSTEIN:No.
It's not that Jeff stops at nothing.
It's that when Jeff sets his mind on a goal that he thinks he can achieve, he won’t stop until he’s proven wrong or until he achieves it.SHEL KAPHAN,Former chief technical officer, Amazon:Jeff and MacKenzie had rented a house in Bellevue.
And then we moved to a small second-floor office in the south part of Seattle.NARRATOR:Shel Kaphan was Amazon employee No.
1, one of nine former Amazon insiders who agreed to talk on camera.SHEL KAPHAN:What the company is now was nowhere in my wildest imagination.
Nowhere.
So the fact that it could have the kind of position in the world that it has now, I had no clue.NARRATOR:In July 1995, Amazon.com went live.JAMES MARCUS,Former senior editor, Amazon:It was an incredible novelty; it was tiny and obscure; and it’s very hard to imagine, but the entire universe that Amazon now dominates did not exist.MALE NEWSREADER:Amazon.com.
This virtual shop claims to be the world’s largest bookstore.NARRATOR:It didn’t take long for Bezos’ vision to prove prescient.JEFF BEZOS:What makes us different is vast selection, convenience—we deliver right to the desktop.
If our catalog were printed on paper it would be the size of seven New York City phone books.NARRATOR:The company quickly outgrew the garage and soon had more than 50 employees.
In 1996, James Marcus applied to be No.
55.JAMES MARCUS:There was a very palpable excitement in the air at this place, and of course at this point Jeff Bezos was the first person to interview every prospective employee, so I was ushered into his office.
He wanted to see how fast you are on your feet.
He also always wanted to know your SAT scores.JAMES JACOBY:He wanted to know your SAT scores?JAMES MARCUS:Every time, yes.JAMES JACOBY:How old were you at the time?JAMES MARCUS:I was 36 or 37.JEFF BEZOS:This is the original sign that I made for Amazon.com.
Blue spray paint on white poster board.JAMES MARCUS:Jeff wasn’t a figure out of folklore at that point.
He was not the wealthiest man in the world.JEFF BEZOS:Here’s my computer, Amazon.com up on the screen.
Hello, Jeff Bezos.JAMES MARCUS:He was a small, nondescript, sandy-haired man sitting at a desk, with quite a large and eruptive laugh.But he wasn’t threatening.
He was a normal guy to a sort of amazing extent.JEFF BEZOS:Hal 9000 hat.
Very important.
Hal and I share a birthday, we’re both born on January 12th.JAMES MARCUS:It belied an enormous Napoleonic ambition.JEFF BEZOS:One of the people I really like, Thomas Edison.
Here’s a model of his original light bulb.
He’s famous for saying, "1% inspiration, 99% perspiration."
Laughs] It turns out ideas are the easy part.
Execution is everything.JAMES MARCUS:Domination was on Jeff’s mind from the beginning.
One of his sort of second-in-command people said to me, "You have to understand that Jeff wants to sell many more things than books.
And Jeff’s idea is that in the near-distant future you could buy a kayak from Amazon.
And after you bought the kayak, you could figure out good places to kayak and buy travel services from Amazon.” So, those ambitions were very clear, and this was very early on.
But he was clearly thinking in those terms from the get-go.JAMES JACOBY:How did that ring to you at the time?JAMES MARCUS:A little bit exciting and a little bit nutty.JEFF BEZOS:Amazon.com.
Very good website.
You should really try it.
Laughs]JAMES MARCUS:If you signed on to work at a kind of futuristic bookstore and the guy who owned it was suddenly talking about selling every object in the universe, you just weren’t sure how seriously to take it.NARRATOR:Though his public image was often unserious—JEFF BEZOS:That was awesome!NARRATOR:—inside the company, Bezos was a hard-charging manager relentlessly focused on the principle that would make Amazon one of the most trusted brands in the world: The customer always comes first.JEFF BEZOS:This culture of customer obsession——obsessive focus on customer——obsesses over our customers——totally obsessing over the customer experience.JENNIFER CAST,Vice president, specialty recruiting, Amazon:We used to call it "customer ecstasy."
It means building, delivering, focusing on your customer, and we did it in the very, very early days at every stage.NARRATOR:Jennifer Cast was there in the early days and is one of six top Amazon executives the company put forward to speak to us.JENNIFER CAST:Customer obsession was our North Star.
And so it was a place where we knew we were a part of something that was new, the internet.
There was an excitement that we were doing something that hadn't been done before.
It was exhilarating.
We were all aligned around building for customers.JEFF BEZOS:Hey, you guys!
Laughs]JAMES JACOBY:I’ve heard there was an empty chair that would often be put at meetings.
Who was in the empty chair?JOHN ROSSMAN,Former director, Marketplace division, Amazon:Yeah, so that empty chair was there to remind us all to understand the customer, have empathy for the customer, understand the details of the customer experience.
The customer isn’t there; we have to bring forward the voice of the customer.MALE AMAZON OPERATOR:Thank you for calling Amazon.com.NARRATOR:And Bezos quickly learned that, in this new online world, he could understand exactly how customers were behaving.FEMALE AMAZON OPERATOR:All orders do need to be placed online, but I'd be happy—JAMES MARCUS:It was made clear from the beginning that data collection was also one of Amazon’s businesses.
All customer behavior that flowed through the site was recorded and tracked.
And that itself was a valuable commodity.FEMALE AMAZON OPERATOR:Have you visited our website?RANDY MILLER, Former director, Pricing & Product Management, Amazon:We could track how a customer navigated through the site.
So we could see what you looked at; we could also see what you paused at; we could see what you put in your basket but didn’t order; we could see what you put in your basket and did order.
So that’s when we started realizing, man, this is rich, this is rich rich rich.
And so we’ve used it for everything.MALE REPORTER:What do you do with that information?JEFF BEZOS:That’s the data that allows us to predict, or try to predict, what books that you would like that you haven’t discovered yet.NARRATOR:Bezos treated the site as a laboratory where he studied customer behavior along with his chief scientist, Andreas Weigend.ANDREAS WEIGEND:I was shocked to see how predictable people are.
If you take the time of the day into account, if you take maybe when they were last on the site, how long they were on the site last time, how long they’re on the site today, you know what they’re falling for.ROBERT FREDERICK,Former senior manager, Amazon Web Services:Whoever owns—collects the data.
If you have access to and rights to data, then you are king.
It’s all about the data.
Everything.JEFF BEZOS:One of the most fascinating kind of tools we have at our disposal is the ability to do active experiments.
It's kind of this huge laboratory.ANDREAS WEIGEND:We did not think about it as exploiting.
We thought about helping people make better decisions.JAMES MARCUS:I was starting to feel that that was less respectful toward the consumer, who was after all was supposed to be our god, the person whose ecstasy was our very reason for being.
And it was closer to getting a cow into a milking stall and extracting as many pails as possible during each visit, and that felt a little more unsavory.
But that was the business of Amazon.FEMALE NEWSREADER:Amazon has added 880,000 new customers—NARRATOR:While Bezos was using these insights to bring more and more customers into Amazon—MALE NEWSREADER:The number of customers who use the website has increased fourfold—NARRATOR:—there was one thing he hadn’t done yet.JAY LENO:The company’s never made a profit.JEFF BEZOS:That’s right.
Laughter]JAY LENO:Now, why?
How does that—why?JEFF BEZOS:Seems like a new math, doesn’t it?NARRATOR:Bezos would spend years losing money trying to beat his competition, and he convinced investors to go along with it.JAMES THOMSON,Former senior manager, Amazon:One of Jeff Bezos’ greatest accomplishments has been his ability to get Wall Street to accept the fact that for 20-some years, Amazon wasn’t going to be very profitable.
And that’s OK because they’re building infrastructure that will create huge opportunities for them to gain scale and gain customers and gain business.NARRATOR:He spelled it out in a letter to shareholders after the company first went public: “It’s all about the long term,” he wrote, rather than short-term profits or Wall Street reactions.STACY MITCHELL,Co-director, Institute for Local Self-Reliance:And he essentially says we are going to forgo profits in order to take market share; that our strategy is to lose money, which enables us then to put other companies out of business who can’t afford to lose money.NARRATOR:That strategy wouldn't sit well with critics like Stacy Mitchell, who advocates for small businesses.STACY MITCHELL:In essence, at the very beginning he’s signaling to shareholders, "I have a strategy to monopolize the market and that’s going to reward you, but it’s going to be far down the road, and will you come along with me?"
And they said yes.NARRATOR:Investors also recognized Bezos’ essential advantage over physical stores, which had to charge their customers sales tax, unlike online businesses.GREG LEROY, Executive director, Good Jobs First:So not collecting sales tax gave Amazon a big leg up over bricks and mortar retailers, and that was central to their early strategy of gaining market share as quickly as they can.STACY MITCHELL:What booksellers were saying to me is that this is driving my customers to Amazon—they’ll come into the store, they’ll browse, they find what they want but then they’ll go buy it on Amazon because they can save that sales tax.GREG LEROY:So it was a very irksome early big issue from the book vendors, first of all—they were kind of the canaries in the mine, so to speak—and then lots of other retailers.MALE NEWSREADER:Amazon has added thousands of warehouse workers and 3 million square feet of space.NARRATOR:Amazon’s sales tax advantage would be central to its success as it expanded beyond books into other products.JEFF BEZOS:And we have a fantastic selection of things you can look at.
Electronics and then, of course, toys.
Yeah, thank you.Here we've got the friendly Pokemon.
This is more than 10 times the selection that you would find in a typical physical world software store.NARRATOR:But Bezos was still a long way from his goal of Amazon being the place where you could buy everything online.
And he saw a way to achieve it.FEMALE NEWSREADER:Amazon could soon become the Walmart of the internet.NARRATOR:There were thousands of businesses eager to sell online.
Bezos offered them a way to do it.FEMALE NEWSREADER:Amazon is transforming itself from an online bookstore to an online mall.NARRATOR:He transformed Amazon into a retail platform where anyone could sell their goods to his customers and invited thousands of other businesses to be a part of it.JEFF BEZOS:It's the easiest place for anybody, small or large, who wants to set up shop online to sell online, because they can access our 12 million-plus customers.
Anybody, all comers.JAMES THOMSON:We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of companies with literally tens of millions of products.NARRATOR:Name brand stores started selling on Bezos’ platform, and so did tens of thousands of small entrepreneurs.JASON BOYCE, Former seller on Amazon:Everyone knew Amazon.com.
The only people that knew SuperDuperHoops.com were the ones that were searching to buy a basketball hoop and saw our name on an advertisement.
To us it was really a no-brainer.
We knew that we would increase our sales.
First year we did 100,000, next year we did a million, we did 2 million, 4 million—we were doubling every year in the early days.NARRATOR:It was great for the companies, and even greater for Jeff Bezos.MALE NEWSREADER:Amazon has become the most recognizable name in e-commerce.NARRATOR:Not only would he take a cut of everything other businesses sold, he’d also keep his own store on the platform, competing against everyone else in marketplace he owned and controlled.JASON BOYCE:He owns the main street.
He has the main street real estate.
Not just one building on the corner, the entire main street.NARRATOR:How Amazon would wield its power over the online marketplace would eventually become a question for government regulators, but early on there were indications.The first to see them were book publishers.JAMES MARCUS:Amazon took over a large market share of the publishing industry very, very fast.
They were very quickly in a position to demand concessions.
I think it was a moment publishers started to realize, "Oh, wait a minute, they’re our partner, but they now have the beginnings of a boot on our windpipe.
NARRATOR:Inside the company they had launched a strategy that some called “the Gazelle Project,” because they’d heard Bezos wanted them to pursue publishers the way a cheetah pursues a sickly gazelle.RANDY MILLER:Well, you don’t go after the strongest.
He's like, "The cheetah.
The cheetah looks for the weak, looks for the sick, looks for the small.” That’s what you go for.
So don’t start with No.
1 publisher.
Start with No.
7 publisher, and then No.
6 publisher, and then by the time you get to No.
3, 2 and 1, the noise has gotten back to them.
They’re going to know this is coming, and chances are you may be able to settle that without a full-on war.DENNIS JOHNSON,CEO, Melville House Books:We were just this little mom and pop publishing company, publishing poetry books and translated fiction.NARRATOR:In the early 2000s the number of books Dennis Johnson was selling on Amazon had been rising steadily.
Then one day he got a phone call.DENNIS JOHNSON:Our distributor called us up to talk about our Amazon contract.
And he said, “I went out to dinner last night with Amazon.
It was like going out to dinner with the Godfather.
They want a kickback.” That’s the word he used: kickback.
And he said they wanted 4% more of our sales.JAMES JACOBY:Was that unusual?DENNIS JOHNSON:It was—in our experience, it was totally unprecedented, yes.NARRATOR:Randy Miller ran the European book team and says he saw nothing wrong with Amazon’s tough tactics to challenge publishers on prices and profit margins.RANDY MILLER:In order to bring them into line, we would actually take them out of automated merchandising, take their prices up to list price.
We would put references on the product page, their product page saying, "You want this cheaper?
You want this book on this topic for a way cheaper price?
Click here."
And we’d send them to whoever we thought their worst competitor was.
That was how Amazon forced their vendors to comply.
But that's an old Walmart trick.
It wasn’t like Amazon created that.
And it made a difference.
And Jeff kind of got excited about it.NARRATOR:When Dennis Johnson still refused to give in to Amazon’s terms, he says the buy button on all Melville House books suddenly disappeared, making it impossible for customers to purchase them on Amazon.DENNIS JOHNSON:I mean, this is the company that referred to little publishers like me as wounded gazelles, I believe?
That’s how they think; that’s how he thought from the beginning.
And we eventually had to pay what at the time I called a bribe.
And our attitude toward Amazon was, you know, render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and carry on as best you can.JAMES JACOBY:Jeff Bezos may say that Amazon comes along and has given publishers like yourself access to a huge distribution channel for your books.
Has Amazon been good for your business?DENNIS JOHNSON:Well, absolutely they have.
Any bookseller that sells our books is good for our business.
So I’m not complaining that Amazon is selling our books.
I’m just complaining of the way that their tactics are hurting the industry I love.NARRATOR:In addition to granting interviews, Amazon responded to written questions.
Regarding Dennis Johnson’s characterizations, it told us, “Amazon disagrees with this account.”JAMES JACOBY:Were you uncomfortable with that sort of ruthlessness ever?RANDY MILLER:Well, no, because I was in retail.
People think that’s ruthless.
You know, I looked—and some people at Amazon, “Wow, that’s kind of mean,” and I’m like, “Oh, a retailer and a supplier having a disagreement?
Stop the presses!"
It happens all the time.
I mean, you know, look—you’ve got finite margin, and somebody’s going to have to give.
And a lot of times Amazon wasn’t the one giving.JEFF BEZOS:Kindle is a purpose-built reading device.NARRATOR:The tension between Amazon and book publishers would ramp up even further with the unveiling of the Kindle, which helped the industry transition to the digital age but gave Amazon more power to set prices lower.JEFF BEZOS:—and new releases are only $9.99.NARRATOR:Around that time, Barry Lynn, an advocate for broad antitrust enforcement, was growing increasingly concerned by what he was hearing from publishers.BARRY LYNN,Executive director, Open Markets Institute:If the door was open, the publisher would say, "Hey, you know, Amazon, they're just a terrific customer.
They're our biggest customer.
They buy the most books, they sell the most books.
We love them.
And you close the door and they say, "Amazon is destroying our business model.
They're destroying our business.
They have way too much power.
We must do something about them.
NARRATOR:Lynn wanted publishers to speak up publicly and thought federal antitrust regulators might investigate whether Amazon was a monopoly, illegally abusing its market dominance in anti-competitive ways.BARRY LYNN:And they'd say, "No way, I'm not going to talk about Amazon in public.
I'm not talking about them on Capitol Hill.
They will take retribution against me.
JAMES JACOBY:To which you responded?BARRY LYNN:“Well, that's why we have to do something about it!”NARRATOR:Jennifer Cast ran Amazon’s books division in its formative years.JAMES JACOBY:We've had a difficult time in some ways getting publishers to talk to us on camera about Amazon.
In part, it seems, the reason is that they're afraid.
How do you react to that, that publishers find it uncomfortable to talk about Amazon publicly?JENNIFER CAST:I don't know.
I haven't seen that.
I haven't been in your shoes.
I'm sure they have—if you're saying that they don't talk negatively about us—I know they have a lot of good things to say about us.
I don't know why they wouldn't speak their minds.
We certainly value speaking our minds.JAMES JACOBY:There is this well-known anecdote about cheetahs and gazelles.
This "gazelle" program.
Do you know about that?JENNIFER CAST:I don't.JAMES JACOBY:We've talked to former Amazonians about it, where Jeff had said, "We should basically try to negotiate with book publishers and try to get better terms and treat the smaller publishers as a cheetah would go after a wounded gazelle.
JENNIFER CAST:I didn't hear the cheetah and gazelle example, but what we were looking for was people that were willing to move away from the old model of bricks and mortars to a new model, which was a virtual store that had many different types of opportunities to present their books to customers.JEFF BEZOS:I want to talk a little bit about how we think about innovation at Amazon.com.NARRATOR:Amazon would begin to accumulate even more power in 2005, when Bezos quietly rolled out a revolutionary new program: Amazon Prime.FEMALE NEWSREADER:Now they have something called the Prime shipping program, where for roughly $79—JEFF BEZOS:Amazon Prime, we only launched this a week ago.
You pay $79 a year and you get two-day shipping for free.NARRATOR:It was a risky bet, and it paid off.SCOTT GALLOWAY, Professor, NYU Stern School of Business:The linchpin, or the glue, if you will, and probably the seminal moment in Amazon’s business history, was the introduction of what has become the most successful membership program in history, and that’s Prime.JEFF BEZOS:Many of you in this audience will already be Amazon Prime members.
Bless you.
This is very much appreciated.NARRATOR:Eventually, more than 150 million people would sign up for the free shipping, a tremendous expense for Amazon.
But to Bezos, it was worth it.JAMES THOMSON:The Prime program at Amazon is one of the most important drivers of Amazon’s growth.
When you go on and look to buy a product and it’s available in two days, delivered to your door anywhere in the country, that Amazon Prime program becomes a mechanism that keeps bringing you back as a customer to keep buying and keep searching for new products on Amazon.NARRATOR:Two-day delivery anywhere in the country was a big promise for a company that, at the time, had less than 10 warehouses.
So Bezos went on a building spree.Across the country Amazon warehouses began to spring up, filled with millions of products being sold on Bezos’ platform.
He’d call them "fulfillment centers," and they’d create hundreds of thousands of jobs in places hard hit by the Great Recession—FEMALE NEWSREADER:—10% of Pennsylvania residents unemployed—MALE NEWSREADER:The job market is in complete disarray.NARRATOR:—like Allentown, Pennsylvania.SPENCER SOPER,Bloomberg News:At that time it was tremendous news that an employer was coming and actually opening a facility and hiring people versus gutting half the staff.NARRATOR:Spencer Soper was a business reporter for the Allentown Morning Call when Amazon opened in the area in 2010.
He began hearing stories about working in the warehouse.SPENCER SOPER:People are basically in this big, sprawling warehouse that’s stocked with goods in very random fashion, and they have scanners that tell them which things to get.
And people are walking maybe 10-15 miles a day.
People are just kind of crisscrossing this big warehouse all day long.NARRATOR:As workers told him about the punishing pace to meet the daily quota of packages, and the intense heat, Soper and his colleagues started to investigate further.SPENCER SOPER:People really felt like Amazon was playing fast and loose with their health.NARRATOR:Soper discovered there had been numerous complaints to authorities at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA.SPENCER SOPER:They actually had a complaint from an emergency room doctor who called their hotline one day saying, "Listen, you might want to check out this Amazon place.
I’ve had people parading through my emergency room to be treated for heat stress."
There was a security guard who worked in the facility who sent a complaint to OSHA saying that he saw pregnant women suffering heat stress in the facility.
And so there’s just like these red flags right and left.NARRATOR:After an investigation, OSHA said Amazon needed to keep the temperatures in the warehouses lower.
In a statement at the time, the company said it installed new industrial air conditioning and pledged that worker safety was its No.
1 priority.SPENCER SOPER:Amazon is shrewd business people.
Shrewd business people know when they have leverage, and when you’re the only shop hiring people in town you can push them a lot harder than you can when they’ve got alternatives.NARRATOR:Over the following years, Amazon would hire hundreds of thousands of workers and become one of the largest jobs creators in the country.
At the fulfillment centers, Bezos experimented with new techniques and technologies to boost productivity.JEFF BEZOS:Willingness to experiment is the key to being able to do new things.
So we do hundreds of experiments every day in our fulfillment centers to get a little bit better.
Kind of like incremental invention.NARRATOR:When a company called Kiva perfected a warehouse robot, Amazon bought the whole company.FEMALE NEWSREADER:Amazon has acquired Kiva Systems.
They make shipping robots.NARRATOR:It helped transform the work environment in Amazon’s warehouses.JEFF WILKE, CEO of Global Consumer, Amazon:When I first showed up at Amazon in 1999 I led our global operations team.NARRATOR:Jeff Wilke created the Amazon fulfillment center system and is one of two CEOs under Jeff Bezos.JEFF WILKE:As we’ve added 200,000 robots, in that same time frame since 2012 we’ve added 300,000 people in our fulfillment centers.
So what happens is the robots change the work so they allow us—people don’t have to walk as far, which is a complaint that we’ve heard in the past.
They make the job safer.
They make them higher quality because we present a smaller set of options to employees and that’s all good for customers.
And it’s good for employees, too.NARRATOR:But at the same time, complaints have persisted.SHEHERYAR KAOOSJI, Executive director, Warehouse Worker Resource Center:People who have worked in warehouses for decades say this is different.
This is not the same.We're here today because we want to make sure that these workers know about their rights in the workplace, especially around heat.NARRATOR:Sheheryar Kaoosji is an advocate for warehouse workers in the San Bernardino, California, area—an Amazon hub, with 10 fulfillment centers and over 15,000 employees.SHEHERYAR KAOOSJI:Because of the way that Amazon operates, because of the way that they set their rates for productivity, it’s a lot harder work physically but also psychologically.NARRATOR:We sat down with a group in San Bernardino who’d recently worked at Amazon.MALE FORMER EMPLOYEE 1:When they first got here I thought it was exciting.
Like for me, I was thinking maybe I could find a place where I’m going set roots, of a good job, move up in the place, but after being there for a while, I was like, there’s no way.MALE FORMER EMPLOYEE 2:It's like, OK, this is where I can probably make a career.
But once you worked there for a certain amount of time, it’s just not realistic how they expect you to work.NARRATOR:Like dozens of workers we’ve spoken to around the country, they say they struggled to keep up with the rate Amazon expected them to pick and pack items.JAMES JACOBY:How realistic are the rates that they're giving you?
I mean, what’s—MALE FORMER EMPLOYEE 3:Not realistic at all.
Unrealistic.JAMES JACOBY:Not realistic?MALE FORMER EMPLOYEE 1:There’s absolutely no way to make rate.
You gotta find little ways to cheat it, because once you hit rate, by the end of the week, they raise it—they bump it up again.
Because they start seeing, hey, people could hit those rates, could hit those numbers, hey, let’s push ‘em a little harder.Every week it seemed like it was going up.MALE FORMER EMPLOYEE 2:You have security cameras right behind you at all times that are looking at you 24/7, and if you don't meet standards or the rates, you're out the door.
You're just disposable.SHEHERYAR KAOOSJI:Every worker has a scanner at all times that basically track exactly where you’re at.MALE FORMER EMPLOYEE 4:And they have a little blue line at the bottom of the screen, and it has how many seconds that you have to have it done by the time it hits zero, and it puts you into panic mode.MALE FORMER EMPLOYEE 5:And pretty much you can’t talk to people.
You can't be in the same aisle as them.
You just constantly have to sit there scanning like a robot, all day long.
If they catch you not scanning, you get a write-up.SHEHERYAR KAOOSJI:And what they’re doing is they’re producing this mass of data that they are using to be able to analyze the entire workforce.MALE FORMER EMPLOYEE 4:We’re not treated as human beings.
We’re not even treated as robots.
We’re treated as part of the data stream.JAMES JACOBY:It’s the incentive at any warehouse, on any assembly line, to get the most out of any worker.SHEHERYAR KAOOSJI:Yes.JAMES JACOBY:To make rates, to be as efficient as possible, to be as productive as possible.
So I don’t see exactly what’s different about Amazon as opposed to any other warehouse.SHEHERYAR KAOOSJI:Amazon is the cutting edge.
Other warehouses are starting to adopt these technologies; other companies are definitely interested in doing what Amazon is doing.
Data collection could become basically the standard for all workers, and that you're never good enough.
You're never able to keep up.NARRATOR:Amazon told us work rates are not based an individual employee’s performance, and that the scanning devices workers use are not for tracking people, but inventory, a common practice in the warehouse industry.JAMES JACOBY:We’ve talked to workers around the country, both current and former workers.
They’ve described the pace of work as being really grueling.
In the early thinking about rates and how far you could push human beings in terms of their productivity, what was the thinking about that?JEFF WILKE:Well, obviously if the rates are too high you’re not going to have people showing up for work.
So we have 600,000 people at the company.
Most of them are in the fulfillment centers and they come to work every day; they stay for years.
These are considered great jobs in the hundreds of communities where we have fulfillment centers all over the world and in the U.S. We have—almost every state has an operation in it, and people come to work because these are great jobs.
They’re safe; we pay double the minimum wage, the national minimum wage.
We have terrific benefits—the benefits for the folks that work on the floor are the same benefits that my family has access to.
Our family leave is like 20 weeks.
So the rates are set so that we can accomplish what we need to, which is get orders to customers in a reasonable time and in a high-quality way, and that creates a workplace that people want to come back to, and they do.NARRATOR:Amazon wouldn’t tell us how long fulfillment center workers stay on the job or how often they’re injured.
But workers we spoke to say the rates are higher than other warehouses, and that the company rebuffs attempts to unionize.AMAZON TRAINING VIDEO:We do not believe unions are in the best interest of our customers, our shareholders or most importantly, our associates.NARRATOR:This is a clip from a video the company says it used in the past to teach managers about employees' rights and labor laws.AMAZON TRAINING VIDEO:The most obvious signs would include use of words associated with unions or union-led movements, like “living wage” or “steward.”JAMES JACOBY:Early on Amazon took a position to basically be anti-union.
Why was that decision made?JEFF WILKE:I don’t think we made the decision to be anti-union.
We just feel that all of the things that unions would want to get us to do, we’ve already done.JAMES JACOBY:What about setting rate, though?
Do you not see that there’s a little bit more leverage in the hands of management in this scenario than there would be in a unionized environment?JEFF WILKE:I don’t know, it’s hard to speculate on that.
But I do think that we have the obligation to set rates that are, again, going to encourage people to seek these jobs and deliver for customers what we’ve promised.JAMES JACOBY:What would you say to someone, though, who’s worked in your fulfillment centers that feels as though there’s been—that humans are increasingly being treated like robots?
Because it’s something that we’ve actually heard, and I don’t sense it’s hyperbole.JEFF WILKE:Well, that’s not the experience that I had in setting it up or that I’ve seen.
It’s certainly true that these jobs are not for everybody, and there may be people that don’t want to do this kind of work.NARRATOR:Amazon executives also stress the company has become an industry leader in training its workforce for career advancement.JEFF WILKE:We just announced a pledge recently to spend $700 million to upskill, which is basically creating career opportunities for people—100,000 of our employees.
We pay 95% of tuition to go to college to get a skill that isn’t about Amazon, that’s about creating options for the employees.
And I would expect those people to take advantage of that, work for us for a couple of years and then go do something that they would much rather do, and that’s OK.JAMES JACOBY:There will be people that will hear what y’all are saying and they’ll say, "Well, you signed up for physical labor, a job is a job, there were benefits and they're now investing $700 million to do retraining for other types of jobs.
What’s the real grievance?
What is there to complain about?
MALEFORMER EMPLOYEE 6:I actually used to think that way for a while whenever I—when I first started—whoever I heard complaints from.
I was like "Well, it was in the job description, and you signed up for it."
The part they don't talk about is the safety rules that you have to ignore to make rate.
It’s not just you go in, OK, you do your job and that’s it.JAMES JACOBY:So you're in a weird bind.MALE FORMER EMPLOYEE 6:It’s incredibly hard to meet rate while following all the safety procedures.JAMES JACOBY:A complaint that we’ve heard from workers in terms of the sort of automation of their work as humans, some of them telling us that yes, there are high safety standards in these fulfillment centers, but that in order to make rate they’re having to cheat the standard a little bit.JEFF WILKE:Well, I would say that’s not OK.
So I—from the moment that I arrived 20 years ago, I made it very clear to our operations teams that we will not compromise the safety of our employees to do anything else.
So we have a culture that if we are asking people to do something that they have to do too fast to be safe, they can raise their hand and say, "This isn’t right," and we’ll fix it.NARRATOR:For years, Amazon has put a happy face on its business and its workforce.SPENCER SOPER:Even in Amazon’s commercials, the people are almost like shadows and silhouettes.
It’s all about boxes, just like happy boxes singing and bumbling their way to your door.
They don’t want you to even think about how they do this.
They just want you to be wowed and, “Oh!
How'd this get here?” They wanted people to just think, “Whoa, magic!”NARRATOR:And magic was a big part of Bezos’ marketing strategy, with an emphasis on the company’s miraculous level of innovation and growth.JEFF BEZOS:We started Amazon Prime in 2005.
But then, something very extraordinary happened—this.
In 2011, the slope of that graph changed, a lot.NARRATOR:As Amazon grew, he wanted his top executives to think about the kind of company it was becoming.
He wrote a memo titled "Amazon.love.
A copy of it was obtained by Brad Stone.BRAD STONE:The memo is another example of Jeff being very prescient about the future.
It's Jeff grappling with the idea that not all big companies are loved; that there is something that we get uncomfortable with when we talk about very big companies.“Rudeness is not cool.
Defeating tiny guys is not cool.
Risk taking is cool.
Winning is cool.
Polite is cool.
Defeating bigger, unsympathetic guys is cool.
Inventing is cool.
Explorers are cool.
Conquerors are not cool.”JEFF BEZOS:Some businesses, you can tell when you go in and have meetings with them, they have a conqueror mentality.
And there's a big difference between a being a conqueror and being an explorer.
And I think in this very inventive space that we're in, it pays to explore.NARRATOR:But to some watching Amazon’s growth, the company was falling short of that ideal and taking steps to make sure nothing got in its way,In 2013, Amazon was moving to create its own delivery system and made a key decision: Rather than hire its own drivers, it built a network of independent businesses to deliver packages.PATRICIA CALLAHAN,ProPublica:They weren't just going to dabble here and dabble there.
They were going to go and create a system that would rival Fed Ex or UPS.NARRATOR:ProPublica reporter Patricia Callahan, in conjunction with BuzzFeed, has investigated the system Amazon set up.PATRICIA CALLAHAN:They figured out a way to get around regulation.
The cargo vans they choose are big enough to stuff with hundreds of Amazon packages, but they're small enough that they're not regulated by the federal government.MALE NEWSREADER:An 84-year-old woman struck and killed by an Amazon delivery truck.MALE NEWSREADER:A woman hit and killed in a parking lot.NARRATOR:ProPublica and BuzzFeed found that drivers are under intense pressure to deliver packages.MALE NEWSREADER:After striking him, the van maneuvered around Salinas and his dog.NARRATOR:And they documented more than 60 crashes, including 13 deaths, since 2015.FEMALE NEWSREADER:An infant critically injured in a car crash has died.PATRICIA CALLAHAN:When it came time to figure out who's responsible, Amazon would always say, "It's the contractor, it's not our responsibility.
JAMES JACOBY:Now you've been able to find 13 deaths, and that's over the course of several years.
Is that statistically significant, given all of the packages that they deliver in any day or any given year?PATRICIA CALLAHAN:So I don't pretend to claim that there's only 13 deaths and that I found every single one.
I just found enough to show that this is happening around the country.
With UPS, there's a record.
There's a federal record you can look at how many serious injury and fatal accidents they have.
With Amazon, that doesn't exist.
No one knows the safety records of all of Amazon's contractors.NARRATOR:Amazon disputed the ProPublica report.
It would not release any data on crashes involving its driver network but told us it had a “better than average” safety record and that nothing is more important to them than safety.JEFF WILKE:Any accident is one accident too many, so just as we were focused on safety in the fulfillment centers and product safety, we set very high standards with all of those partners for safe performance.
We have training videos for the third parties that work with us to help them understand what we expect in terms of the drive.
We have mapping software that we use to help them find the right routes.
Every one of our drivers is required, including the third parties, are required to have comprehensive insurance, including liability insurance, so that if there is an accident, that the person who’s injured is covered.MALE NEWSREADER:Amazon wants to get Prime members their packages even faster—NARRATOR:In the last year, Amazon announced a change to the way it handles Prime deliveries.
Instead of delivering packages in two days, they promise to do it in one.FEMALE NEWSREADER:Free next-day delivery all across the U.S.JEFF BEZOS:It's impossible for me to imagine a world 20 years from now where a customer comes up to me and says, "Jeff, I love Amazon.
I just wish your prices were a little higher."
Or, "I love Amazon.
I just wish you delivered a little more slowly.
NARRATOR:At the same time the delivery network was being set up, Amazon was also rapidly expanding its product offerings, inviting more sellers onto the site, including those from China.RACHEL JOHNSON GREER,Former product safety manager, Amazon:It basically makes it to where it’s super easy for these companies who are maybe not as careful with adhering to the law, where they’re able to just start a business up on Amazon, import some stuff, sell it, cause some problems and then disappear.NARRATOR:Rachel Greer worked in product safety at Amazon and worried that the site was being flooded with untested and potentially unsafe products.RACHEL JOHNSON GREER:Are there proper warnings?
Has it been safety tested for durability?
If the child chews on it, will the paint come off?
Is that paint leaded?JAMES JACOBY:Most people would assume that there’s a pretty high safety standard on Amazon.RACHEL JOHNSON GREER:And that assumption would be incorrect.NARRATOR:She says that's because Amazon, like other tech companies, takes the position that it's not legally responsible if its customers are harmed by products sold by third parties on the site.JAMES JACOBY:If someone buys something that causes harm at Walmart or at Target, a consumer can sue Walmart or Target.RACHEL JOHNSON GREER:Right, because no one is forcing you when you come into Walmart, to enter the doors of Walmart, they aren't making you sign away your rights.JAMES JACOBY:But when do you sign that when you go on Amazon.com?RACHEL JOHNSON GREER:When you make your account.
When you accept the terms and conditions.NARRATOR:People have been challenging Amazon's terms and conditions in court.
Some have even been successful.JAMES JACOBY:Ultimately who's on the hook when a customer buys a dangerous product on Amazon?
Who takes ultimate responsibility for that?JEFF WILKE:Well, in the rare case when something like that happens, if it's a third-party seller, the sale is by a third-party seller, and it is the seller's responsibility to sell a legitimate product to our customer.
And then when Amazon is the retailer, and we sell a product to a customer, then it's our obligation to make sure that we understand the manufacturer and the supply chain for that product and its safety.JAMES JACOBY:But when the other sellers are selling in your store, you're not responsible for it, ultimately, if they're selling your customer a defective or dangerous product?JEFF WILKE:I think the way things work in the U.S. is that the seller of record is the person who is setting the price and who is purchasing the product.
And for things not sold by Amazon, and it says on the detail page, it will tell you who the seller is, it's the seller's responsibility for those things.
And for us, it's very clear, it says "Amazon.com" whenever we sell it.JAMES JACOBY:Do you audit your sellers, in terms of whether they're actually providing safe products to your customers?JEFF WILKE:We do.
Some of our sales, so about almost 60% of our sales are by third parties, and those sales, some of them come directly from the third parties, so we're not involved at all.JAMES JACOBY:But you take a cut.
It's on your infrastructure, it goes through Amazon.com, so I mean—JEFF WILKE:Well, it's on our infrastructure in terms of the website and payments, but we're not, we're—JAMES JACOBY:And fees that—you're taking a cut of the sale, right?JEFF WILKE:Sure, sure.
And we're providing traffic that—that's kind of the way they think about marketing is why they would pay that fee.
But it's harder to, before an experience, inspect that product.MALE NEWSREADER:A South Carolina woman who bought a hair dryer on Amazon said this happened.FEMALE SPEAKER:Fire is coming out of the hair dryer.NARRATOR:Amazon's approach has had consequences.FEMALE NEWSREADER:A hoverboard caused a fire that destroyed their home.NARRATOR:Dangerous products were flagged by authorities in Washington state.FEMALE NEWSREADER:—found dozens of school supplies that had high levels of toxic metals.NARRATOR:And a recent report found thousands of banned, unsafe or mislabeled products.JAMES JACOBY:I’m having a hard time understanding something, which is that Amazon’s entire brand is about the customer, right?RACHEL JOHNSON GREER:Yes.JAMES JACOBY:That it’s—RACHEL JOHNSON GREER:Oh, I reminded them of this over and over again.JAMES JACOBY:You reminded them of what?RACHEL JOHNSON GREER:I said that no customer wants to buy an unsafe product.
No customer wants selection that harms their child.
No customer wants to buy something that burns down their house because it looks cool and it's the latest, coolest thing.JAMES JACOBY:Sitting here today are you able to basically say that the products that you sell on Amazon.com are safe?JEFF WILKE:What I can say is we work really hard to make sure that they’re safe.
We’ve spent $400 million in the last year on systems that seek out things that are not safe, and there are millions of sellers and hundreds of millions of products, and our job is to as fast as we can weed out the ones that don’t belong on our site.We're going to have to be vigilant as a retailer and as a technology company, and we are definitely dedicated to protecting the safety of our customers.NARRATOR:We heard that concern for the customer over and over in our interviews with Amazon executives.DAVE LIMP,Senior vice president, Devices & Services, Amazon:Customer trust in a company like Amazon, it’s just sort of foundational.JAY CARNEY,Senior vice president, Global Affairs, Amazon:Customer obsession is the first leadership principle, and it’s not a corporate slogan.JEFF WILKE:We try to stay really focused on customers.JENNIFER CAST:Very focused on delivering results for our customers.ANDY JASSY, CEO, Amazon Web Services:Providing a great customer experience that customers want.ARDINE WILLIAMS:Delivering that customer delight.NARRATOR:This commitment to the customer and to keeping prices low had another benefit: It helped them avoid running afoul of regulators who enforce the nation’s antitrust laws.BARRY LYNN:It's important to understand that there's two fundamental philosophies of antitrust, of anti-monopoly law.
There's the traditional philosophy in which you want to break up all potential concentrations of power that you can.
But for the last 30 years, there's been this change in how we do antitrust.
And this is the idea that the only purpose of antitrust should be to drive prices lower to serve the interest of the consumer.NARRATOR:Lynn had been urging regulators to take a more traditional approach and examine whether the company was gaining market power in exploitative ways, stifling fair competition but keeping prices low for consumers.JAMES JACOBY:We live in a society of consumers, though, and seemingly there is some net benefit to all of us when prices are low.
So, what's wrong with that view of things?BARRY LYNN:It's obviously good for people to—for all people if we can drive down prices.
If we have lower price drugs, if we have books that anybody could buy, that's a good thing.
It's a good thing for society, and it's a good thing for us as consumers.But we're not only consumers.
We're also citizens.
We're also producers.
We're also people who think and who make things and who grow things, and we want to have access to open markets.NARRATOR:Once again, the tension was most pronounced with book publishers.
Amazon was selling around 40% of all new books in America—and two-thirds of all electronic books—thanks to the success of the Kindle.Then, one of the world’s largest publishers, Hachette, decided to push back.
Franklin Foer was one of its authors.FRANKLIN FOER, Author, "World Without Mind":Hachette and Amazon set out to renegotiate their e-book contract.
And Hachette said, "No, we don’t accept the terms of your contract."
And Amazon basically said, “To hell with you, Hachette.
We’re going to stop delivering your books.
If somebody searches for a Hachette title, we’re going to redirect them to another publisher.”MALE NEWSREADER:Amazon’s battle with Hachette and the authors that Hachette publishes is heating up.NARRATOR:As Bezos’ virtual blockade dragged on for months—JUDY WOODRUFF:A bitter seven-month standoff—NARRATOR:—thousands of authors, including bestsellers like Douglas Preston, were caught in the middle.DOUGLAS PRESTON, Author:Some authors were losing 50% to 90% of their sales from Amazon.
It was absolutely devastating to first-time authors.
It actually destroyed their careers.JAMES JACOBY:Did you see your sales plummet?DOUGLAS PRESTON:I did.
Yes, I saw my sales plummet tremendously.NARRATOR:In frustration, Preston penned an open letter on behalf of all authors.
It was published in The New York Times with more than 900 signatures.DOUGLAS PRESTON:We authors have loved Amazon.
We have enthusiastically supported it, and this is how they treat us?
This is not right.FEMALE NEWSREADER:Amazon has been accused of doing everything from raising prices to deliberately delaying shipments.MALE NEWSREADER:Is this what happens when Jeff Bezos decides to flex his muscles?NARRATOR:While Hachette and Amazon were at an impasse, Douglas Preston, Franklin Foer and other authors went to Washington and asked the Obama administration to open an investigation.FRANKLIN FOER:I went to the Justice Department and I went to the Federal Trade Commission with the Authors Guild and we tried to explain to them why this power was so dangerous.
We pointed out all the ways in which Amazon was bullying the publishing industry.DOUGLAS PRESTON:The Department of Justice listened to us, and their answer was essentially this: "Amazon is one of the most popular companies in the country.
They have brought tremendous services to consumers and they've brought lower prices.” And that we hadn’t given them any kind of reason to open an antitrust investigation.NARRATOR:Eventually, Hachette and Amazon would settle their dispute, with Amazon allowing Hachette to set its own prices for e-books but offering it incentives to keep them low.PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:It’s great to be here at Amazon.NARRATOR:Amazon would thrive during the Obama years and eventually account for nearly 40% of all online commerce in the country.PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA:Last year during the busiest day of the Christmas rush, customers around the world ordered more than 300 items from Amazon every second.NARRATOR:But the complaints about its tactics would continue, with retailers of all kinds concerned that Amazon had become the online shopping gatekeeper.JASON BOYCE:You’ve got to be on Amazon.
You have to be there because that’s where everyone is.
A hundred million Prime subscribers.
They are the de facto e-commerce channel in the United States.
Period.
End of list.JAMES JACOBY:Amazon executives have told us that there are many other options out there.
There is Walmart, there's Alibaba.
As a seller, you’ve got options.JASON BOYCE:I’ve heard that response from Amazon executives before, and we did that.
We listed all of our products on every other online marketplace, but it’s a testament to just how good Amazon is.
All of the others that were not Amazon combined did about 10% of what we were doing on Amazon.NARRATOR:Businesses big and small have been accumulating complaints about Amazon’s hold on them.JAMES THOMPSON:On Amazon, the customer belongs to Amazon.
It doesn’t belong to the third-party seller; you are basically renting the Amazon customer.NARRATOR:James Thomson used to recruit brands to come onto Amazon and now advises them on how to do business with the company.JAMES THOMPSON:I represent brands today that face a number of challenges with Amazon.NARRATOR:Among those challenges: Businesses say that Amazon has access to their valuable data, which gives it an unfair advantage.They also complain about increasingly higher fees to stay on the platform and pressure to use Amazon’s warehouses and shipping services.We spoke to numerous name brand companies, but none would share its grievances on camera.MALE AMAZON SELLER 1:My account was suspended.NARRATOR:Some small business people have been talking about their experiences, good and bad, online.MALE AMAZON SELLER 2:When you're selling on Amazon you’re playing in someone else’s playground.STACY MITCHELL:Who gets placed where, whether or not your product shows up in the search results.FEMALE AMAZON SELLER:They suspended my account without warning—STACY MITCHELL:These are all things that are governed by Amazon’s rules.
And if there’s a dispute within that arena, if you feel you are mistreated, the judge and jury is Amazon.MALE AMAZON SELLER 3:They don’t care, they’ll just kill your account like that, or suspend it.PAUL RAFELSON,Executive director, Online Merchants Guild:There are all sorts of crazy stories about why people get their accounts shut down on Amazon.
And it could take a week, it could take months, it could be never before you're back online again.
Amazon has the upper hand and the ability to basically take your business away from you at any given moment.AMAZON AD:Selling on Amazon, take one.NARRATOR:Amazon said third-party sellers account for more than half of everything sold on the site—MALE AMAZON SELLER 4:I sell mini longboard skateboards.MALE AMAZON SELLER 5:I sell mineral water.
This is what I do.NARRATOR:—and it's committed to its sellers’ success, proactively contacting them when their accounts are at risk of suspension and offering an appeals process to resolve disputes.AMAZON TRAINING VIDEO:You already have great products.
Scale up and—NARRATOR:But in the eyes of some businesses, Amazon has essentially become like the railroads at the turn of the last century that controlled the flow of commerce across the country.AMAZON TRAINING VIDEO:Start selling today.JAMES JACOBY:Do you see yourself as being kind of like the rails for e-commerce, that sellers bring their goods to market ON your rails, through your marketplace?JEFF WILKE:I don’t think of it that way and here’s why: The vast majority of stuff that's sold—well, all of the stuff that’s sold is manufactured, right?
So it’s manufactured, meaning there are brands AND factories that produce stuff and then sell it.
We’re 1% of the retail sales in the world, about.JAMES JACOBY:Well, you are the biggest marketplace online right?JEFF WILKE:No.
So again, I don’t—the idea that there’s an online distinct for brands to sell their stuff in, distinct from physical, just doesn’t make sense to me, and we’re far from the largest retailer.
So I describe this as retail, and we’re competing against Walmart and Target and Costco and Carrefour and Alibaba and Tmall and all kinds of folks who are now selling both physical stores and online.NARRATOR:In addition to pointing to other large retailers, inside the company, employees have been schooled in how to talk about its size and power.JAMES THOMSON:When I worked at Amazon we had training specifically on the use of terms like "monopoly."
We were not allowed to use a term like "market share."
Amazon has what’s known as "market segment share."
What is "market segment"?
What is "market segment share"?
I don’t know, but I know the lawyers at Amazon feel that those terms are much safer than using terms like "market share.
JAMES JACOBY:So market share was something they were really concerned about.JAMES THOMSON:Clearly somebody with the necessary legal training or PR training recognized that Amazon was growing very quickly, and when we were asked to use the term "market segment" and "market segment share," in essence it’s a polite way of saying, "I’m not gonna talk to you about how big we are.
NARRATOR:Since leaving Amazon 20 years ago, Shel Kaphan has been watching the company with increasing concern, and he’s speaking out about it for the first time.SHEL KAPHAN:I think that the characterization of Amazon as being a ruthless competitor is true, and under the flag of customer obsession they can do a lot of things, which might not be good for people who aren't their customers.JAMES JACOBY:I know you're not a legal scholar, but are you basically concerned that Amazon is a monopoly?SHEL KAPHAN:I'm concerned that it has that type of power.
I think whether you technically can call it a monopoly or not, I don't know.NARRATOR:That question has continued to loom over Amazon.STACY MITCHELL:I think that Amazon is looking out, and the existential threat that they may face is going to be from government.
It’s whether or not policymakers are going to step in and intervene and say, "You have too much power.
NARRATOR:For years, Bezos has been ramping up Amazon's profile in Washington.FEMALE NEWSREADER:Amazon has been lobbying the FAA to lift—MALE NEWSREADER:—trying to cozy up to politicians so that they will give him the biggest tax breaks around.NARRATOR:Spending millions a year on lobbying.FEMALE NEWSREADER:Amazon lobbied more government entities than any other tech company.NARRATOR:And hiring as its spokesman the former White House press secretary Jay Carney.JAMES JACOBY:You’ve got an army of lobbyists, many of whom have revolved in and out of government, including yourself.
What are you hoping to get for all that lobbying spend and all that influence?JAY CARNEY:One of the things we discovered is because of the visibility of our company, but also the range of businesses that we’re in, we need subject-matter experts on food safety, on transportation, on drones, on privacy.
And also, we can be a resource, an information provider to policymakers and regulators.
It’s not lobbying in the traditional sense in terms of trying to persuade somebody to so something.
It's just answering questions and providing data and information.NARRATOR:Bezos himself would also become a presence in the capital and eventually buy the largest private residence in town.FRANKLIN FOER:Jeff Bezos never really showed much interest in politics, but as he’s cemented himself in the city, he started to acquire this physical presence.
He bought a mansion and developed it into a place that’s explicitly designed to be social.STACY MITCHELL:It has a big ballroom.
I mean, it is designed to create a real presence for him in the nation’s capital, where he can hobnob with the people who make decisions.NARRATOR:He’d even bought the hometown newspaper—MALE NEWSREADER:Jeff Bezos sent a thunderbolt through the media world this week—NARRATOR:—spending a quarter of a billion dollars to rescue the struggling Washington Post.JEFF BEZOS:And I do believe that democracy dies in darkness.
I think that the capital city of the United States of America needs a paper like The Washington Post.FRANKLIN FOER:I gotta say, full credit to him, he hasn’t intervened in any of the coverage of the paper.
And he’s invested in the paper.
Every dollar of profit that the paper makes is plowed back into making it a better paper.BRAD STONE:Bezos allowed the Post to hire, to restock its newsroom.
He reversed what had been an atmosphere of sort of decline.
I'd say The Washington Post has really flourished under Bezos' ownership.JEFF BEZOS:Let’s cut this digital ribbon.NARRATOR:At the time, critics saw a more cynical motive.MALE NEWSREADER:Perhaps he’s buying The Washington Post to buy some sort of protection.MALE NEWSREADER:Precisely.
This deal could give him more influence over politics.FRANKLIN FOER:Nobody hangs out in Washington, D.C., just to go to the free museums.
You buy a home in Washington, you buy a newspaper in Washington, because it is the most influential city in the world and you want to lay your hands on that power.NARRATOR:Bezos saw a business opportunity there as well.
The Obama administration planned to modernize the federal government by embracing cloud computing.
Bezos had been quietly building a revolutionary cloud computing business.
He called it Amazon Web Services.BRAD STONE:It's basically computing power in the cloud, but really it's Amazon’s server farms around the world that give people access to the kind of technology services they need.NARRATOR:To keep Amazon running, Bezos had developed an unprecedented digital infrastructure.
He realized he could rent parts of it out, not just to businesses, but also to the government.AMAZON PROMOTIONAL VIDEO:Our infrastructure is built to satisfy the security standards of the most risk-sensitive organizations.JAMES BANDLER, ProPublica:He's already got a huge edge over the other big competitors in it.
So he wants to take that lead and capture the U.S. government.NARRATOR:In 2013, he got a major boost when it was revealed that Amazon Web Services had designed a computing cloud for the CIA.MALE NEWSREADER:Amazon Web Services was awarded a 10-year contract for $600 million.MALE NEWSREADER:Amazon is helping the CIA build a secure cloud computer network.JAMES BANDLER:The CIA contract was probably one of the best things that happened to Amazon's cloud business.
It lifted all doubts about the security of the cloud and about whether you could trust Amazon with your most precious data.BRAD STONE:The message to the world is, if the CIA trusts Amazon with its data, then maybe other companies and government institutions can as well.NARRATOR:And they did.EXPEDIA AD:Experience it with Expedia.NARRATOR:AWS became by far the world’s leading cloud computing platform.CBS AD:—on CBS.NARRATOR:Today more than a million businesses, as well as PBS, pay Amazon to store and manage their data.Bezos had again anticipated the next frontier in technology and had made himself indispensable to it.STACY MITCHELL:What Jeff Bezos is after is really creating a company that is the infrastructure, that owns the infrastructure for how commerce is done.
And that’s an incredibly powerful place to be.MALE CONFERENCE ANNOUNCER:Please welcome chief executive officer of Amazon Web Services, Andy Jassy.NARRATOR:Andy Jassy created and runs AWS.
He credits the service with making it easier to do business and sparking innovation throughout the economy.ANDY JASSY:Look at what AWS has enabled with regard to change in our society.
Look at—Netflix changed the way that we consume digital content, and Airbnb changed the way that we get accommodations, and Hola and Grab and Lyft and Uber changed the way that we get transportation.
AWS has enabled—has been a part of enabling all these huge innovations and changes in consumer experiences that have made life better for people.AWS AD:And we're the cloud with the most capabilities, the most innovation, the most customers.NARRATOR:The division generated $35 billion in sales last year.AWS AD:Amazon Web Services.
Build on.NARRATOR:The success of AWS gave Bezos billions to expand Amazon from a company that sells everything to a company that does everything.A top priority—WILLIAM SHATNER:To boldly go where no man has gone before!NARRATOR:—was to create the sci-fi future he’d fallen in love with as a child.WILLIAM SHATNER:Gentlemen, this computer has an auditory sensor.
It can, in effect, hear sounds.NARRATOR:A world of artificial intelligence, in which computers can think and make decisions for humans and about humans.FRANKLIN FOER:Jeff Bezos is a big fan of "Star Trek."
He admits that that was on his brain when he came up with the idea that Amazon should be pursuing a little disk that you can bark commands into.WILLIAM SHATNER:Stop.FRANKLIN FOER:This is his "beam me up, Scotty" fantasy realized.JEFF BEZOS:We started working on this device.
And our vision was, in the long term, it would become the "Star Trek" computer.AMAZON ECHO AD:When it first arrived from Amazon, I didn’t know what it was.NARRATOR:In 2014, Bezos’ talking computer, the Amazon Echo, hit the market.AMAZON ECHO AD:Is it for me?It’s for everyone.NARRATOR:The voice known as Alexa would embed Amazon deeper into the lives of millions of people.AMAZON ECHO AD:Alexa, what do you do?ALEXA:I can play music, answer questions, get the news and weather.FRANKLIN FOER:They call it a personal assistant, and just that term implies this intimate connection that we then begin to develop with Amazon.ALEXA USER:Alexa, sing the ABC song.ALEXA:[Singing] A B C D E F G—AMY WEBB:I believe that when we think about the future and the future with artificial intelligence given where we currently are today, Alexa in some ways represents the moment that it becomes seamlessly interwoven with our lives.AMAZON ECHO AD:Alexa, how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon?ALEXA:One tablespoon equals three teaspoons.AMAZON ECHO AD:Oh, OK.AMY WEBB:And the problem is that we forget that it’s there.MALE ALEXA USER:Alexa, lights on.ALEXA:NARRATOR:But Alexa is also listening.
And she’s learning.ALEXA:I’m answering questions and learning more.NARRATOR:And that helps Amazon in the race to dominate artificial intelligence.BRAD STONE:Every time you ask Alexa something, you're making the Alexa algorithm better.
It's one of the reasons why Amazon, having had a head start, is able to kind of preserve that head start, because they've got the most data of anyone.MEREDITH WHITTAKER,Co-director, AI Now Institute, NYU:Alexa is one more way for Amazon to gather extremely valuable data.
And this data collection is extremely important to this business model.
It’s extremely hard to do, and convincing people to just deploy something like this in their home is a brilliant trick.NARRATOR:Dave Limp is Amazon’s head of devices.JAMES JACOBY:How is it that you convinced tens of millions of people to put what is essentially a listening device in their homes?DAVE LIMP:Well, I would first disagree with the premise.
It doesn't—it's not a listening device.
The device in its core is—it has a detector on it—we call it internally a "wake-word engine"—and that detector is listening—not really listening, it's detecting one thing and one thing only, which is the word you've said that you want to get the attention of that Echo.NARRATOR:Once the device is awake and the blue light is on, it’s recording.
And last year, it was revealed that Amazon employs thousands of people around the world to listen and transcribe some of those recordings to help train the system.JAMES JACOBY:Do you think that you did a good enough job of disclosing that to consumers?
That there are humans involved in listening to these recordings?DAVE LIMP:We try to articulate what we're doing with our products as clearly as we can.
But if I could go back in time and I could be more clear and the team could be more clear on how we were using human beings to annotate a small percentage of the data, I would, for sure.
What I would say, though, is that once we realize that customers didn't clearly understand this, within a couple of days we added an opt-out feature so that customers could turn off annotation if they so chose.
And then within a month or two later we allowed people to auto-delete data, which they also asked for within that time frame.We're not going to always be perfect, but when we make mistakes, I think the key is that we correct them very quickly on behalf of customers.NARRATOR:But even one of the founders of Amazon Web Services approaches his Alexa devices with caution.JAMES JACOBY:When do you turn off your Alexa?ROBERT FREDERICK, Former senior manager, Amazon Web Services:I turn off my Alexa when I know for a fact that the conversation that I am going to have or whenever I just want to have a private moment.
I don’t want certain conversations to be heard by humans, conversations that I know for a fact are not things that should be shared, then I actually turn off those particular listening devices.DAVE LIMP:We have had an incredible year.
The team has invented a lot on behalf of customers and I cannot wait to show you what we have.NARRATOR:So far, Limp and his team have made Alexa compatible with more than 100,000 products.DAVE LIMP:Echo Frames allow you to get done more around you and be more present in the everyday.SHOSHANA ZUBOFF,Author, "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism":Now they’re going to know more about you than anyone knows.
They’re trying to move as intimately as possible and as quietly as possible into everyday life.DAVE LIMP:Echo Loop is a smart ring, packed with ways to stay on top of your day.SHOSHANA ZUBOFF:Amazon wants to have the entire environment essentially miked.AMAZON ECHO BUDS AD:Alexa, start my running playlist.SHOSHANA ZUBOFF:They want your walk in the park, they want your run down the city street.NATIONWIDE INSURANCE AD:Nationwide’s teamed up with Amazon to bring you the all new Echo Auto.SHOSHANA ZUBOFF:They want what you do in your car, they what you do in your home.DAVE LIMP:Amazon Smart Oven.AMAZON SMART OVEN AD:Alexa, bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.SHOSHANA ZUBOFF:All these intimacies, all this insight is being integrated—analyzed and integrated.AMAZON ALEXA AD:Alexa, alarm off.SHOSHANA ZUBOFF:That is an extraordinary kind of power that has never before existed.NARRATOR:After Alexa, Amazon would go on to spend nearly a billion dollars to buy Ring—MALE VOICE:Hey, bud, the police are on the way.NARRATOR:—a doorbell camera and app that Amazon describes as “the new neighborhood watch.”MALE VOICE:Hey, hey—get away!
Get out of there!NARRATOR:To promote it, Amazon has enlisted the help of hundreds of local police departments.MALE POLICE OFFICER:It’s a phenomenal tool to assist detectives.NARRATOR:They give them access to a portal to request footage and have given free cameras to hand out—and talking points.FEMALE POLICE OFFICER:This system is so simple to use.MEREDITH WHITTAKER:You have Amazon in partnership with police departments, who have basically turned policemen into Avon salespeople for Amazon Ring.
They have given police departments talking points and marketing materials to encourage the installation of Ring by community residents.
None of this was public knowledge.DAVE LIMP:And this is Ring’s first indoor cam.
It is cute, is what I would say.NARRATOR:Amazon has continued to expand the scope of Ring.
Last fall, Dave Limp unveiled a version designed to monitor the inside of people’s homes.Within weeks, hackers discovered a way to terrorize Ring customers.MALE HACKER VOICE:Come on, can you say the magic word?
N*****!YOUNG GIRL:Who is that?MALE HACKER VOICE:I’m your best friend.
I’m Santa Claus.YOUNG GIRL:Mommy!JAMES JACOBY:Did you see that video?DAVE LIMP:I did see that video.JAMES JACOBY:What did you think of it?DAVE LIMP:I think that that is an industry problem.
It's not just about a Ring camera—it could be about anybody's cameras.
It's about any device.
And we've already investigated that one to make sure what the root cause was.What we want to be able to do in those cases is we want to minimize them.
We'd like to detect them.
And we also want to build tools that give them the ability so that doesn't—that makes it harder for those kinds of attacks to happen.
There’s a lot of bad people in this world.JAMES JACOBY:Here's a device that you had described as “cute” and seems harmless, and I'm just wondering whether you're being straight with people about the attendant risks to your customers that you are obsessed with, supposedly.DAVE LIMP:Well, it's not supposedly, we are obsessed with customers.
I would say that we are trying to build security features at every level of the stack: operating systems, authentication, fraud detection.
We offer things that customers can turn on that make it even harder for those attacks to happen.MALE HACKER VOICE:Yo, what’s up?
How’s your day?FEMALE VICTIM:Who is that?MALE HACKER VOICE:What’s going on, buddy?
What are you watching?NARRATOR:There were a series of similar attacks across the country.MALE HACKER VOICE:What’s up, homie?
I still see you.You hungry?What’s goin' on, my main man Shaq?NARRATOR:And it’s not just hackers.
Ring has fired some of its own employees for spying on customers.JAMES JACOBY:In George Orwell's "1984," he describes a dystopia in which “you had to live, you did live from habit that became instinct in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard.” And I wonder if you ever think about how easily this could become dystopian to some degree.DAVE LIMP:Well, I don't want to live in that world.
So I do not want to invent the technology that—or have my teams invent the technology that would create that world.
And so—but I am an optimist.
I think if you take the absolute view of that, we wouldn't invent anything.JAMES JACOBY:We're increasingly living in a world in which your products and your designs are there.
Can you see how it could be concerning in some ways that we all can't opt out of that world at this point?DAVE LIMP:Sure.
I can see why it could be concerning to some customers.
Our job in building that technology is to build it in such a way that it takes into account for the scenarios that you just talked about as best as we possibly can.
The reality of it is that world happened way before Ring or Alexa.NARRATOR:That’s something that Bezos himself wrestled with 20 years ago.Oct.
20, 2000JEFF BEZOS:I believe that privacy is going to be one of the prominent issues of the 21st century.
There are towns now in the United States that have installed security cameras on every corner and their crime rates decrease by 80%, but do you really want cameras on every corner?
There are very strange things that are going to happen over the next 100 years with respect to technology that are going to challenge us as a society to figure out how we want to deal with privacy, so that's—NARRATOR:Decades later, Bezos would be at the vanguard of expanding the use of that kind of technology.AMAZON REKOGNITION PROMOTIONAL VIDEO:Introducing Amazon Rekognition Video.ANDY JASSY:Rekognition allows you to pass an image to us.
You can say, "Do these two faces match?"
which is incredibly useful for applications in the security space.
You can imagine unlocking your—NARRATOR:After Amazon rolled out a facial recognition tool, it marketed it to law enforcement.AMAZON REKOGNITION PROMOTIONAL VIDEO:Recognize and track persons of interest, from a collection of tens of millions of faces.NARRATOR:Police we’ve spoken to say it’s a valuable tool to identify suspects quickly.MALE POLICE OFFICER:It appears to be a match, but I’m going to make sure I look at them all.NARRATOR:And while Amazon has offered guidelines for how it should be used, there are few laws governing the use of this technology.MALE SPEAKER:It returns anybody with warrants that look like her.NARRATOR:Civil liberties advocates have raised concerns, as have computer scientists, who worry Amazon has released the software before it's ready and that police are essentially field-testing it on the public on behalf of the company.ANIMA ANANDKUMAR,Former AI principal scientist, Amazon:The tools are not what I call battle-tested, and we still do not understand how well they work in the environments in which they’ll be applied.
That's where I see a danger.NARRATOR:Anima Anandkumar was the principal scientist for artificial intelligence at Amazon.In her first interview about her concerns, she told us she was particularly alarmed by an MIT study that found the software prone to mistakes with darker-skinned faces.
Amazon has questioned the study’s methodology.ANIMA ANANDKUMAR:As a researcher in AI I feel it’s my personal responsibility to educate the public of where AI truly is today.
Because they hear so much of AI being hyped up—it’s supposed to be magical, it’s supposed to solve all the world’s problems.
I see the potential in doing that, but at the same time we need a reality check.
We need to ask, "Where is AI today?
What can it truly do well?
JAMES JACOBY:And when it comes to facial recognition, you don’t think it’s ready for prime time.ANIMA ANANDKUMAR:I don’t think face recognition is ready for prime time in challenging applications like law enforcement.NARRATOR:Anandkumar and other scientists have asked Amazon to stop selling Rekognition to law enforcement because they say the system’s accuracy is still in question and there are no clear regulations about how it’s used.We asked Andy Jassy about it.ANDY JASSY:I have a different view, and we’ve spent—we’ve had the facial recognition technology out for use for over 2 1/2 years now, and in those 2 1/2 years we’ve never had any reported misuse of law enforcement using the facial recognition technology.
And I think a lot of societal good is already being done with facial recognition technology.
Already you’ve seen hundreds of missing kids reunited with their parents and hundreds of human trafficking victims saved and all kinds of security and identity and education uses.
There’s a lot of good that’s been done with it.
But I also understand that it could be misused.I think at the end of the day with any technology, whether you’re talking about facial recognition technology or anything else, the people that use the technology have to be responsible for it, and if they use it irresponsibly they have to be held accountable.JAMES JACOBY:There’s been all sorts of problems with policing in this country.
So why allow police departments to experiment?ANDY JASSY:We believe that governments and the organizations that are charged with keeping our communities safe have to have access to the most sophisticated, modern technology that exists.
We don’t have a large number of police departments that are using our facial recognition technology and, as I said, we’ve never received any complaints of misuse.
Let’s see if somehow they abuse the technology.
They haven’t done that, and to assume that they’re going to do it and therefore you shouldn’t allow them to have access to the most sophisticated technology out there doesn’t feel like the right balance to me.JAMES JACOBY:It’s been difficult to even know how many police departments are using the facial recognition technology, and there’s no public auditing to know whether there are complaints about abuse.
How would the public ever know?ANDY JASSY:You know, again, I don’t think we know the total number of police departments that are using facial recognition technology.
I mean there’s—you can use any number—we have 165 services in our technology infrastructure platform, and you can use them in whatever conjunction, any combination that you want.
We know of some, and the vast majority of those that are using it are using it according to the guidance that we’ve prescribed, and when they’re not, we have conversations.
And if we find that they’re using it in some irresponsible way we won’t allow them to use the service and the platform.NARRATOR:Andy Jassy and Jeff Bezos have said they want governments to hurry up and regulate how law enforcement can use facial recognition.
But in the meantime, Amazon has forged ahead and has even discussed its services with Immigration and Customs Enforcement—AMAZON WEB SERVICES PROMOTIONAL VIDEO:At Amazon Web Services—NARRATOR:—and the U.S. military.AMAZON WEB SERVICES PROMOTIONAL VIDEO:—to deliver for our warfighters and defense leaders for when it matters most.NARRATOR:Bezos himself has made it clear that he sees Amazon playing a critical role in national security as well as in commerce.JEFF BEZOS:We're going to continue to support the DOD, and I think we should.

I kind of think that in like 10 years Jeff Bezos owns every single thing there is.SCOTT GALLOWAY:So Amazon has these Darth Vader-like abilities to just look at a sector and begin choking it of oxygen without even touching it.
Amazon can begin beating competitors without even competing.JAMES JACOBY:You actually think that Amazon is having a negative effect on competition in the innovation economy right now?SCOTT GALLOWAY:I think it’s a mixed bag.
I think that you could argue and there’s evidence that they have inspired innovation in certain sectors.
But I think there’s a lot of small companies that aren’t being formed because if you go in to try and raise money for an e-commerce company, it’s, "Well, how are we going to compete against Amazon?"
And I say, "Well, the answer can be summarized in one word: impossible.

If they wanted to actually show that they were willing to work with this community and our values, they did a horrible job.COREY JOHNSON:You are in a union city.
And one of the first answers to your question today, is would you be neutral?
You said, no!
That is not a way to come to our city.NARRATOR:It was not the reaction the company expected when it launched the contest.
Two weeks later, Amazon pulled out.MALE NEWSREADER:Amazon is pulling the plug on its New York plans.JAY CARNEY:We decided we didn’t have to be there in that political dynamic.
The fact of the matter is, when it turned out the governor and the mayor supporting something turned out not to be enough to persuade other critics that it was the right kind of investment for New York to make, we decided, that’s fine, we can go elsewhere.JAMES JACOBY:He said to us that it turned out that the governor and the mayor supporting something wasn’t enough to persuade other critics that it was the right kind of investment for New York to make, so we decided it’s fine, we’ll go elsewhere.BILL De BLASIO:That’s an idiotic statement on its face.
That is pure idiocy from a guy who should know a hell a lot better.

Amazon knew it was done.
There was noise, there was posturing by people in the political world, but the deal was done, so all we’re talking about here is the background noise.In what world are there no critics?
Well, yeah, in an autocratic totalitarian world maybe they’re not allowed, and maybe that’s the world that Jeff Bezos somewhere in his mind thinks he is entitled to.NARRATOR:At the time, Bezos was involved in some personal turmoil.FEMALE NEWSREADER:Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his wife of 25 years announcing they are splitting.MALE NEWSREADER:The announcement coming amid tabloid reports that Bezos is now in a relationship with former news anchor Lauren Sanchez.NARRATOR:The National Enquirer had been pursuing him for months.MALE NEWSREADER:The tabloid claims it tracked him across five states and over 4,000 miles.NARRATOR:Bezos saw the Enquirer’s report as politically motivated.CHRIS MATTHEWS:So what would be the motive here of getting that embarrassing material about Bezos and his alleged affair to the National Enquirer?
Who would want to get the dirt in the press?NARRATOR:The magazine’s owner, David Pecker, was linked to two powerful men who disliked how they were covered by Bezos’ Washington Post.The first was President Trump.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:It’s put there for the benefit—The Washington Post—of Amazon.
That's my opinion.NARRATOR:The second: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, who the CIA had tied to the murder of one of the Post’s journalists, Jamal Khashoggi.MALE NEWSREADER:Former CIA Director John Brennan said, "I have no doubt that Saudi Arabia would want to embarrass Jeff Bezos and hurt him financially.

He was very transparent, he was very courageous, he admitted some very embarrassing things about himself, didn't try to deny it, and positioned the other individual as the bully and kicked the bully in the nuts and somehow turned this into net positive.
I mean, this really was the PR strategy and execution of the ages.
I’ve never seen anything like this.NARRATOR:Publicly, Bezos has pushed ahead undaunted, a world-famous celebrity.
And even after a $38 billion divorce settlement, still the richest person on the planet.But the calls to reign in his company are growing louder.SEN.
ELIZABETH WARREN (D-Mass.
Amazon reported $10 billion in profits and paid zero in taxes.SEN.
CORY BOOKER (D-N.Y.):I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that.SPENCER SOPER:Here’s Bezos archiving this American dream and success, and he’s now the target of all of this criticism and basically becomes a symbol of all of these problems.ANDREW YANG, Entrepreneur:Amazon is closing 30% of America’s stores and malls and paying 0%.SPENCER SOPER:You’re basically a pinata dangling in front of any politician with a populist message.
Anyone who wants to talk about wealth inequality, they’re pointing their finger at you.SEN.
BERNIE SANDERS (D-Vt.):This is why three people own more wealth than the bottom half.SPENCER SOPER:If they want to talk about problems with capitalism in general, they’re pointing their finger at you.ELIZABETH WARREN:We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies.NARRATOR:And it’s coming from all sides.MALE NEWSREADER:President Trump just sent a chill down the spine of Jeff Bezos.MALE NEWSREADER:Today the president again teed off against Amazon on Twitter.NARRATOR:President Trump has made Bezos’ ownership of The Washington Post a regular target.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:Washington Post, Bezos uses that as his lobbyist, OK?FRANKLIN FOER:He kind of assumed that The Washington Post was operated in the sort of way that he would operate a newspaper.
And so he thought that Bezos was dictating coverage to the Post, which we should be careful to say is not the case.NARRATOR:Trump has also criticized Amazon and accused the company of evading taxes.Last year, the company was competing for a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Department of Defense.JAMES BANDLER, ProPublica:This contract would have solidified Bezos’ dominance in cloud computing.
This is a hugely important thing.NARRATOR:But the company claims President Trump intervened to scuttle the deal.PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:—and we're looking at it very seriously.
It's a very big contract, one of the biggest ever given.MALE NEWSREADER:A big win for Microsoft, beating out Amazon—FEMALE NEWSREADER:Amazon can protest the outcome, especially given the unusual, unprecedented comments by President Trump.
But Amazon hasn't said—JAMES BANDLER:It’s extraordinary times we live in that one of the world’s biggest corporations, Amazon, is now saying the president of the United States has corrupted our ability to win this contract.JAMES JACOBY:Is there any evidence of that?JAMES BANDLER:The evidence is what the president has publicly said.NARRATOR:And Amazon’s problems have continued to multiply.The Federal Trade Commission is now reconsidering its stance on antitrust enforcement and is looking at Amazon, as are regulators in the EU.REP.
DAVID CICILLINE, Chairman, antitrust subcommittee:This gatekeeper power and how the platforms are exercising it is of tremendous concern.NARRATOR:In Washington, Democratic Congressman David Cicilline has launched an antitrust investigation into allegations of abusive conduct by Amazon and the other tech giants.DAVID CICILLINE:Given your experience, do you agree with Amazon's statement suggesting that it seeks to act in the best interest of independent sellers?DAVID BARNETT, Author:I disagree with that.
We get what I might call bullying with a smile.DAVID CICILLINE:We were able to get several CEOs to come to a public hearing.
That required tremendous courage, because there's a real potential for economic retaliation for their sharing that.DAVID BARNETT:We don't have the resources to fight Amazon.
We could use some help.JAMES JACOBY:In the course of your investigation thus far, and you've had several public hearings, have you seen any evidence of anti-competitive behavior by Amazon?DAVID CICILLINE:We have seen evidence of anti-competitive behavior by all of the large platforms as a result of their market dominance.
but it sort of doesn't fall on the companies to fix this problem.
It falls on us.Without objection, the hearing is adjourned.NARRATOR:Cicilline’s committee is considering everything from imposing limits on what businesses a company like Amazon can engage in to restricting the collection and use of data.The man who helped Jeff Bezos build Amazon more than 25 years ago says it may be necessary to go even further.SHEL KAPHAN:On the one hand, I'm proud of what it became, but it also scares me.
And I just feel like it's important for someone in my situation to at least say what they think about what's going on.JAMES JACOBY:This is sort of in some ways a baby that you gave birth to, right?
And so, I mean, you helped birth Amazon.SHEL KAPHAN:Yeah, very much so.
In fact, I used to get up several times during the night just to see if it was working and take care of it if it wasn't, so.JAMES JACOBY:And when you look at what Amazon has grown into today, you see what?SHEL KAPHAN:[Laughs] Well, you don't want to see your offspring become anti-social adults, right?
So, I think not all of the effects of the company on the world are for the best.
I wish it weren't so, but I had something to do with bringing it into existence.
So, it's partly on me.JAMES JACOBY:Isn't this just capitalism?
Isn't this just a company doing what a company does?SHEL KAPHAN:Yes.
Yes, it is.
I think they're doing what the business schools teach people to do, and they're doing it aggressively and skillfully and with great intelligence.
And they will continue to do that unless they're constrained by other forces in society.JAMES JACOBY:There are proposals out there to break up Amazon.
Is that something you'd promote, the idea of breaking them up?SHEL KAPHAN:I think that they're now at the scale where that could potentially make sense.JAMES JACOBY:How do you and Jeff and others at the senior leadership level think about the call to break you guys up?ANDY JASSY:We don’t think about it very deeply.
I’ve been in Amazon now for 22 1/2 years, and I always remember one of the first things I heard Jeff Bezos say back when we could fit the whole company in just one conference room for an all-hands meeting.
He said, "I would not go to bed at night fearing your competitors or fearing any external issues.
I would go to bed at night fearing whether you’re doing right by your customers."
And that really is a credo that we live here, and it’s what we spend most of our time thinking about.JEFF WILKE:Well, I understand that we’re big and that we deserve scrutiny.
And I think everything that’s large in the economy and in society should deserve scrutiny.The problem is when you think about us, we’re in a lot of verticals, yes.
There’s video and there’s commerce and there’s web services—there are all these things.
But in every one of them we have intense competition, and I do understand why when you’re in a lot of them it can seem like we’re everywhere, but the global—if we were everywhere, that means we’re talking about the global economy, not just global retail.
It’s so vast we’re a speck.JAMES JACOBY:To the public it may sound strange coming from Amazon, which is a company with basically a trillion-dollar market cap, your CEO is the richest man in the world, but Jeff Wilke said to me that you’re kind of just a speck in the scheme of things.
Do you see how that can seem strange or in incongruous?ANDY JASSY:You know, Amazon as a whole has become—has been successful, but simply because the company’s been successful in a few different business segments doesn’t mean it’s somehow too big.NARRATOR:As Jeff Bezos’ company is coming under ever-greater scrutiny, for everything from how it wields power to even its impact on the environment, he’s continuing to look beyond it all.JEFF BEZOS:We get to preserve this unique gem of a planet, which is completely irreplaceable.
There is no Plan B.
We have to save this planet, and we shouldn't give up a future for our grandchildren's grandchildren of dynamism and growth.
We can have both.
Who is going to do this work?NARRATOR:He’s spending a billion dollars a year of his personal fortune on a space exploration company he created.JEFF BEZOS:And it's this generation’s job to build that road to space, so that the future generations can unleash their creativity.NARRATOR:For Bezos, it’s always been about one thing: his vision for the future.JEFF BEZOS:I want you to think about this.
This vision sounds very big and it is.
None of this is easy.
All of it is hard.
But I want to inspire you, and so think about this: Big things start small.

He is best known for being the founder, CEO and chairman of leading online retailer Amazon.
With a net worth of $130 billion, he is noted as the world’s richest person and the first person to be worth over $100 billion.Will Jeff Bezos bring his dogs to space next?In July 2021, Jeff Bezos flew to space in his ship, Blue Origin, and became one of the first billionaires to fly into space on their own rocket.
He launched a second flight in October 2021 withWilliam Shatneras part of the crew on the second manned launch.
At 90, Shatner was the oldest person ever aboard a space flight.Now, the only question we have is: Will Jeff Bezoseverbring dogs to space?
He’s invitedTom Hanksamongst other celebrities but what we really want to see are more astronaut pooches, even if it just Spot Minithe robot dog.
And, we know he’s cool with them being in theAmazon headquarters.Bezos’ space flight was the second of celebrity space flights withRichard Bransonbeating him out by nine days.
Branson’s Virgin Galactic managed heights of 54 miles while Bezos’Blue Origin reached 66 miles.
So, if you were going to declare a winner in the epic celebrity space odyssey, you would have to factor in a couple of things.
For us, the best celebrity space flight will have to be one with dog astronauts.
No question.Who is Jeff Bezos?
A Brief HistorySince a young age, Bezos always showed an interesting in science and technology, eventually graduating from Princeton University with Bachelor of Science degrees in computer science and electrical engineering.
After graduating, he found work in telecommunications and then banking.After finding success in banking through his 20s, he left to launch his first online venture with an online bookstore named “Amazon” out of his garage.
He always planned to expand from books to other products, eventually doing so through capital raised in 1998.

                                  as well as other partner offers and accept ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy.It's been a turbulent two-and-a-half years for Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez.In January 2019, the bombshell news broke that the Amazon CEO and his wife, MacKenzie, weregetting a divorceafter 25 years of marriage.
Hours later, we learned that Bezos was in a relationship with Lauren Sanchez, a TV host and helicopter pilot who, along with her husband, had been friends with the Bezoses.Despite a tumultuous few months that involved leaked texts, blackmail, a billion-dollar divorce, and maybe even interference from the Saudi Arabian government, Bezos and Sanchez are still going strong.When Bezos embarked onhis high-profile trip to the edge of space, Sanchez was in attendance, greeting him with a hug when he landed back on Earth.Here's how their relationship became public and how they've spent the last two years as a couple.It all started on January 9, 2019.
Shortly after 9 a.m., Jeff and his wife, MacKenzie, issued a joint statement on Twitter that they were divorcing.Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos.Dia Dipasupil / Staff"As our family and close friends know, after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends,"the statement read.
If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again.
MacKenzie is one of Amazon's earliest employees.
The couple has four children together.Hours later, a second bombshell dropped: Bezos was in a relationship with Lauren Sanchez.Lauren Sanchez.Paul Archuleta/Getty ImagesSanchezstarted her career as a news reporter and anchor— she was a longtime anchor of "Good Day LA" on Fox 11 and worked as a correspondent on "Extra.
More recently, she's worked as a helicopter pilot and founded her own aerial filming company in 2016 called Black Ops Aviation.Sanchez has also had TV and film roles, including as the host of the reality show "So You Think You Can Dance" and playing an anchor in movies like "Fight Club" and "The Day After Tomorrow," according toher IMDB page.Bezos and Sanchez met through her then-husband, Patrick Whitesell, the co-CEO of WME, a Hollywood talent agency.Jeff Bezos, right, with Lauren Sanchez and her then-husband, Patrick Whitesell.Todd Williamson/Getty Images for Amazon StudiosSanchez and Whitesell had been married since 2005, but at the time the news broke, the couple had been separated since that fall,according to Page Six.According to Brad Stone's book"Amazon Unbound,"Sanchez and Bezos reconnected at an Amazon Studios party for the film "Manchester by the Sea" in 2016, though it's unclear when their romance began.In March 2018, Sanchez was invited to Amazon's annual MARS conference in Palm Springs.
One month later, they had dinner with Sanchez's brother, Michael, in Los Angeles.That July, Bezos hired Sanchez's company tofilm footagefor his rocket company, Blue Origin.The National Enquirer said it had conducted a four-month investigation into Bezos and Sanchez's relationship and had obtained texts and photos the couple had sent to each other.Jeff Bezos.AP Photo/Pablo Martinez MonsivaisThe Enquirer saidit had tracked the couple "across five states and 40,000 miles, tailed them in private jets, swanky limos, helicopter rides, romantic hikes, five-star hotel hideaways, intimate dinner dates and 'quality time' in hidden love nests.
Page Six, which published the news a few hours before the Enquirer, reported that Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos knew that the Enquirer report was coming out and had timed their divorce announcement to get ahead of the news.The gossip site also reported at the time that Bezos and Sanchez started dating after Jeff and MacKenzie had separated the previous fall, and that MacKenzie knew of the relationship.The Enquirer said it had gotten its hands on "raunchy messages" and "erotic selfies," including a text that reportedly read: "I love you, alive girl.
FILE PHOTO:  Founder, Chairman, CEO and President of Amazon Jeff Bezos speaks during an event about Blue Origin's space exploration plans in WashingtonREUTERS/Clodagh KilcoyneThe tabloid saidit also had racy photosof Bezos, including one that was too explicit to print.But according to Stone's book, the tabloid never actually had a "below-the-belt selfie" of Bezos — it was a photo of someone else Michael Sanchez took from a male escort website and showed to the tabloid over FaceTime.Almost immediately, questions arose about the Enquirer's motives for investigating Bezos and Sanchez and the tabloid's connection to President Trump.David Pecker, CEO of AMI.Marion Curtis via AP, FileA feud has simmered for years between Trump and Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, a frequent Trump target.
The Enquirer's publisher, AMI, is run by David Pecker, a longtime Trump ally.By the end of January,The Daily Beast reportedthat Bezos was funding an investigation into who had leaked his private messages to the Enquirer.
Bezos' personal head of security, Gavin de Becker,headed up the investigation.
De Becker said at the time that he thought the leaks were "politically motivated," whichAMI denied.The investigation initially pointed to Michael Sanchez, Lauren's brother and an outspoken Trump supporter, as the person who leaked the photos and texts, whichSanchez denied.Then, in February, Bezos dropped a bombshell of his own: an explosive blog post titled "No thank you, Mr. Pecker," in which he accused Pecker and AMI of trying to blackmail him.Jeff Bezos.Reuters/Joshua RobertsBezos wrotethat the publisher had been threatening him with the publication of explicit photos he'd taken of himself unless he stopped investigating who was leaking his photos and texts to the tabloid.AMI also demanded that Bezos no longer claim the publisher's investigation into his personal life was influenced by political motivations, Bezos wrote.As a result, Bezos published the emails he'd received from AMI.
Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten," Bezos wrote.Bezos also hinted in the post that there may have been a link between the investigation into his relationship with Sanchez and the Saudi Arabian government — specifically, that he might have been a target of the Saudis because he owns the Washington Post, which provided "unrelenting coverage," Bezos said, of the murder of its journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, who waskilled by Saudi agents.
The "Saudi angle" of Bezos' own investigation into the leaks seemed to have "hit a particularly sensitive nerve" with Pecker, Bezos wrote.For its part,the Saudi Arabian government denied any rolein the situation and called the whole saga a "soap opera.
Things quieted down for Bezos and Sanchez publicly for a few months, until April 2019, when Jeff and MacKenzie finalized the terms of their divorce.Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos at the 2017 Vanity Fair Oscar Party.Evan Agostini / AP ImagesJeff and MacKenzie Bezos bothreleased statements on Twittersaying they had "finished the process of dissolving" their marriage and would be co-parenting their four kids.MacKenzie said she was granting Jeff all her interests in the Washington Post and Blue Origin, as well as 75% of the Amazon stock they owned and voting control over the shares she retained.Her remaining stake in Amazon has positioned her among the richest people in the world witha net worth of $62.7 billion.One day later, Sanchez and Whitesell filed for divorce.Patrick Whitesell and Lauren Sanchez.AP PhotoTMZ reported at the timethat the couple asked for joint custody of their two children.
The couple reportedlyfinalized their divorcein October 2019.The Bezos divorce was finalized in July.
A few days later, Bezos and Sanchez made their first public appearance as a couple at Wimbledon.Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos.AP Photo/Tim IrelandThe couple wereseated behind the royalsat the men's Wimbledon final between Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic at the All England Club.A few months prior to Wimbledon, the couple had attended another exclusive event: the annual Allen & Company conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.
There, they mingled with Warren Buffett, Tim Cook, and Mark Zuckerberg, according to Stone's book.The pair was spotted again in August on what appeared to be a fabulous European vacation: They were seen strolling through Saint-Tropez and cruising off the coast of Spain, in the Balearic Islands, aboard media mogul David Geffen's superyacht, the Rising Sun.The Rising Sun.Victor Fraile/ReutersOther guestsreportedly includedGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and the founder of Thrive Capital, Josh Kushner, along with his supermodel wife, Karlie Kloss.Bezos and Sanchez were then seen on fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg's sailing yacht off the coast of Italy.

Sanchez claimed in the suit that Bezos told journalists he had handed over the images to the tabloid, but he says he never had the photos in his possession.Bezos saidin a court filing of his ownthat the suit amounted to "extortion" and directly threatened free speech.
Bezos sought to dismiss Sanchez's lawsuit under a California law that's intended to protect against frivolous lawsuits.A judge has sincetossed Sanchez's defamation suit, citing a lack of evidence.
The judge later ordered Sanchez to pay $218,000 in legal fees for Bezos.In the lawsuit, Sanchez used the word "fiancé" to describe Bezos' relationship to Lauren Sanchez, implying that the couple is engaged.Bezos and Sanchez outside the Taj Mahal in January.Pawan Sharma/AFP via Getty ImagesHere's the full sentencefrom the lawsuit(emphasis ours):"While Mr. de Becker's initial asserted theory was that Mr. Sanchez had sold out his sister for $200,000, Mr. de Becker soon realized this theory would not hold up because, among other reasons, it was inconceivable that Mr. Sanchez would ruin his relationship with his sister andher current fiancé, the richest man in the world,for financial gain.
Bezos isn't described as Sanchez's fiancé anywhere else in the suit, and Bezos and Sanchez have never confirmed that they're engaged.
In December,Page Six published photosof the couple on vacation, noting that Sanchez was wearing a large diamond ring on her right hand (engagement rings are worn on the left hand).At the time lawyers for Michael Sanchez said in a statement, "Michael's complaint speaks for itself."
Representatives for Bezos and Sanchez did not respond to requests for comment.News broke in February 2020 that Bezos had reportedly purchased the Warner estate, a massive Beverly Hills compound, for $165 million.
The purchase was the most expensive home sale in California history.The Warner estate in Beverly Hills.Los Angeles County/PictometryPrior to the sale,The New York Postreported that Bezos and Sanchez had been house-hunting in Los Angeles and touring mansions throughout the area for weeks.The Warner estatewas built by Hollywood mogul and Warner Bros. cofounder Jack Warner in 1937.
It spans eight acres and is situated in the Benedict Canyon neighborhood of Beverly Hills.
It's an incredibly private property that's surrounded by tall hedges, blocked off by a large gate, and completely hidden from view from the street.The compound is home to multiple dwellings, including two guesthouses and a 13,600-square-foot mansion.
The estate also features a pool, tennis court, and manicured gardens, as well as a nine-hole golf course and a "motor court" with its own garage and gas pumps, according toArchitectural Digest.Then, in July, Bezos appeared to make another purchase, this time right next door: a $10 million home that shares a hedge line with the Warner estate.
According to property records viewed by bothVarietyandDaily Mail, Bezos is the new owner of the 1930s-era home on a side street in Beverly Hills' Benedict Canyon neighborhood.In February 2021, Bezos announced that he would step down as CEO of Amazon in the third quarter, with Andy Jassy, the CEO of AWS, taking his place.
The move became official on July 5, 2021.Andy Jassy, left, and Jeff Bezos.Mike Blake/Reuters; Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty ImagesSource:InsiderOn July 20, Bezos lifted off aboard a Blue Origin rocket, accompanied by his brother, Mark, 82-hear-old aviator Wally Funk, and Dutch teen Oliver Daemen.

It was only after he emailed CEO Bezos in desperation, however, that the company swung into action.Wilma was returned to Guttfield earlier this week after being found in the home of the delivery driver, who worked for an unnamed Amazon logistics supplier.
Amazon located the driver using its tracking software, Guttfield said.
The motive for the theft was not clear, and the police are investigating.Amazon said there was no excuse for the incident.
This is inexcusable and does not reflect the high standards we have for our delivery partners," a spokesman said.Richard Guttfield and Wilma.Richard Guttfield"We take these matters seriously and this individual is no longer delivering Amazon packages for the independent delivery service provider.
Guttfield was angry that it took an email to the CEO for Amazon to take the issue seriously.
He said:"Nobody appeared to have the authority to look into this quickly.
All we wanted was the driver's details so we could ask if he saw the dog.
We weren't on a witch hunt.
It was rather a long shot to go right to the top and email Jeff Bezos, but then all of a sudden things started to happen.
We got a reply from someone who said he was in receipt of my email and had asked him to contact us.
It was in a sense [reassuring], but something that was pretty serious in the outset was pretty much ignored for three or four days.
You never know what could have happened to the dog, and we would have appreciated some sort of help sooner.
Bezos said last month that he still personally reads "most" customer-complaint emails sent to him— and if he believes they should be dealt with, he forwards them on with a single-character message.
I see most of those emails.
I see them and I forward them to the executives in charge of the area with a question mark.
It's shorthand [for], 'Can you look into this?'
Why is this happening?'"
Bezos said.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.Getty/Chip SomodevillaGuttfield, who runs a small tech firm, 4quotes4me, in Britain, was happy to have Wilma home but said the dog was a little out of sorts.
He thanked the charity Dog Lost for its support, and said he wanted to raise awareness for another stolen dog near where he lives.Sign up for notifications from Insider!

Extra kudos to the team for figuring out how to make this happen even amidst COVID, and to Wesley Homes for stepping up with the facility.A post shared byJeff Bezos(@jeffbezos) onSep 22, 2020 at 6:30am PDTIf you’re not familiar with Jeff Bezos’ broader plans in education, to open more and more “Montessori-inspired preschools in underserved communities” — $1 billion worth of them — then you may want to see his original post about it all:pic.twitter.com/2GlgjztK1u— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos)September 13, 2018Bezos was actually a Montessori child himself, attending a Montessori preschool in Albuquerque, New Mexico in the mid 1960s.“I went to Montessori school [for] about a year and a half, starting probably at age 2 1/2.
...
I have these very clear visual images of tracing out letters on sandpaper.
I remember having a little special board that you can use to practice tying your shoes.”— Jeff Bezos, Interview with Montessori Life · Winter 2000Montessori Shoelaces FrameMontessori Sandpaper LettersJeff Bezos’ mom once shared a funny anecdote about her son’s Montessori experience:“[He] would get so engrossed in his activities as a Montessori preschooler that his teachers would literally have to pick him up out of his chair to go to the next task.”— Jacklyn Bezos, WSJ · April 2011Bezos is in good company as a Montessori alum.
Here are just a few other standout former Montessori children: Google foundersSergey Brin & Larry Page, Nobel prize winnerGabriel García Márquez,master game designerWill Wright Wright, and NBA superstarSteph Curry.“I benefited from [my] Montessori education, which in some ways gives the students a lot more freedom to do things at their own pace, to discover… Some of the credit for the willingness to go on your own interests, you can tie that back to that Montessori education.”— Sergey Brin, Co-Founder of Google and Montessori childA message to Jeff BezosWith the near opening of your first preschool inspired by Montessori, we’d like to say thank you and cheers to your great investment in children … and therefore in all of us.

This one in Des Moines, WA, is the first of many free preschools that we’ll be opening for underserved children.”The preschool will have a year-round curriculum, five days a week, for children 3-5 years old.
According to the Bezos Day Onewebsite, the team selected to put the preschool in Des Moines, a town to the south of Seattle based on income levels, rates of participation in free and reduced-cost meal programs, gaps in access to license childcare providers, and buy-in from local businesses who will support the growth of the preschool.
It will continue to use this kind of data set for choosing locations to other schools.Bezos first announced his intention to build a network of preschools in November 2018, when he launched the $2 billion Bezos Day One Fund.
The fund has two priorities: giving to nonprofits that are helping homeless families, and building a network of preschools.
Since its launch, the fund has given around $100 milliona yearto a variety of homeless-focused nonprofits.
The Amazon founder has remained relatively quiet about the schools initiative, until today.The schools will be inspired by Montessori, a method of education where curriculums are more hands-on, collaborative, and change based on the individual student’s own interests.
Bezos attended a Montessori school when he was 2 years old in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
You know, intuitively, I think it was probably a very formative experience for me to be able to go to those classes, in that environment, and be so stimulated at an early age,” BezostoldMontessori Lifemagazine in a 2000 interview.
I don’t actually know what the scientific research shows, but intuitively I have to imagine that it’s good for little kids.” In the same interview, Bezos recalled “tracing out letters on sandpaper” and “painting on a big easel.”The network of preschools will operate under the parent nonprofit organization, also called Bezos Academy.
The group is in the process of hiring for a position that will  assess the success or failures of the preschool program.Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Send me a securetip.Angel Au-YeungEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

The schools are built in low-income communities and designed for underserved children, offering them access to free programs.Montessori schools emphasize hands-on and self-directed learning, with uninterrupted blocks of working time, in mixed-age classrooms.
Bezos is a product of a Montessori education, along withGooglefounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.At the time of the announcement, Bezos said he wanted to run the schools using Amazon's own principles, namely, customer obsession.
The child will be the customer," he added.Bezos launched the Day One Fund with a $2 billion commitment in September 2018, with the goal of launching preschools under the Day 1 Academies Fund and helping homeless families under the Day 1 Families Fund.The Day One Fund has been closely watched since its announcement two years ago.

These students learn how to learn.
This goes against traditional education because of its focus on what students need to learn.Believe it or not, the Montessori learning model has produced several famous people.
Several of these people went on to be billionaires or scientists.
If you’re looking to teach your child using theMontessori method, these famous Montessori alumni might inspire you.
Your child may become a famous billionaire or scientist too!Read the following list to learn more about famous Montessori alumni!1.
Jeff BezosJeff Bezos was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1964.
His first school was aMontessori preschoolin his hometown.
The name of the preschool is unknown.
He only attended the Montessori school for a year and a half.
After preschool, the Bezos family moved to Houston, Texas.
Here he stopped attending Montessori school and was enrolled in River Oaks Elementary School.He finished his primary education at Miami Palmetto Senior High School in Pinecrest, Florida.After high school, Jeff Bezos attended (and graduated from) Princeton University.
Graduating from an Ivy League school is an incredible feat.
Bezos’ early education at the Montessori school in New Mexico set him up for success.While Bezos is better known for his multi-billion dollar company, Amazon, he is also known for opening several Montessori-inspired schools.The Bezos Academy is comprised of several tuition-free preschools.
These preschools are built in underserved neighborhoods.
Source)These schools are open year-round and teach children based on the Montessori method.
That said, these schools also use other curriculum methods to provide the best learning environment for children.There are Bezos Academy in Texas, Florida, and the state of Washington.
It is expected that these preschools will expand elsewhere.2.
Bill GatesBill Gates is also a Montessori alumnus.Bill Gates was born in Seattle, Washington in 1955.
While the preschool he attended is unknown, it is known that he attend Lakeside School, a private school in Seattle that caters to grades 5 through 12.
It is considered one of the best schools in the United States.
In fact, this is where Gates met Paul Allen, the person he would found Microsoft with.
After high school, Bill Gates attended Harvard University.Like Bezos, Gates is also a multi-billionaire.
He is also the co-founder of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
This foundation serves many charities and is working towards curing malaria worldwide.3.
Larry PageAt first glance, the name Larry Page might not ring any bells.
However, Larry Page’s work influences your life every day.
Larry Page is one of the founders of Google.Larry Page was born in Lansing, Michigan in 1973.
The first school he attended was Okemos Montessori Radmoor.
He also attended East Lansing High School.
His secondary education consisted of both the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the Interlochen Center for the Arts.Page credits his earlyMontessori educationfor his self-motivation.
Like the others on this list, Larry Page is valued at more than 100 billion dollars.4.
Sergey BrinAlthough Larry Page is an incredibly intelligent person, he didn’t found Google by himself.
Sergey Brin helped Page found Google.Brin’s education began at the Paint Branch Montessori School in Spencerville, Maryland.
This school has been one of the leading Montessori schools in the nation.
Afterward, Brin attended the John Hopkins Center for Talented Youth and Eleanor Roosevelt High School.
His secondary education consisted of the University of Maryland and Stanford University.
Source)Before founding Google, Sergey Brin was the president of Alphabet, Inc.
This company later evolved into the multibillion-dollar tech company we know today.Once again, Sergey Brin has a net worth of more than 115 billion dollars.Brin credits his free-thinking and problem-solving mentality to the freeform curriculum taught in Montessori schools.
When children learn at a young age to learn because they want to rather than because they’re told to, they become lifelong learners.
Some even become multi-billionaires running some of the most successful businesses in the world.5.
Stephen CurrySuccess doesn’t just manifest in business transactions and computer science inventions.
Some Montessori students, such as Stephen Curry have gone on to live very successful sporting careers.Stephen Curry was born in Akron, Ohio in 1988.
He attended aMontessori preschool(as did the rest of his siblings).
He also attended Charlotte Christian School and Davidson College.
Following in the footsteps of his father, Stephen Curry went on to play in the NBA.
Source)Watch the following video to learn how the Curry family benefited from Montessori education.6.
Anne FrankIt might surprise you to hear that Anne Frank was a Montessori student.
However, Anne grew up only 1,400 miles away from the birthplace of Montessori learning.Anne Frank was born 20 years afterDr.
Maria Montessoricreated this teaching method.
In other words, Anne Frank was one of the first Montessori students.Unfortunately, Anne didn’t get to live a long successful life.
That said, she is still an incredibly influential person who has earned the respect of people around the world.7.
Taylor SwiftTaylor Swift started as a singer/songwriter.
However, it didn’t take long for her to become of the most influential women in the music industry.Taylor Swift was born in West Reading, Pennsylvania in 1989.
She attended Alvernia Montessori School.
This school was so influential in her life that she later donated several thousand dollars to it.Perhaps it was Swift’s Montessori education that inspired her to take over the music production industry.8.
Julia ChildJulia Child, a famous cookbook writer and cooking instructor, was so influential that movies were made in her honor.
She is a Montessori school alumnus.Child was born in 1912 in Pasadena, California.
She attended a Montessori school in her early years and was inspired to live a life full of discovery.

His visit was part of the school’s 75th anniversary celebration.
After he spoke with the school’s current student body, he strolled down memory lane with reporterMelanie Markley:Question: When did you attend River Oaks Elementary?Answer: I went here in fourth, fifth and sixth grades.
And I either graduated (from there) in ’76 or ’77 — that basic time frame.Q: What kind of student were you at River Oaks?A: I was very studious.
I have always been a very kind of heads-down, studious kid.
I was a goody-goody.Q: Did you ever get in trouble?A: I told one story to the kids about a time when we accidentally burst open a beanbag.
We were playing rough with the beanbag in the classroom, and it burst open, and tiny little Styrofoam beads went everywhere.
We were trying to clean them up before the teachers could get back.
They walked in on me while I had this electric fan turned on high and I was trying to blow the beads around into one corner.
I got into quite a bit of trouble for that.Q: Are there any teachers that stand out in your mind?A: Yeah, there are.
I think that is one of the great things about this school is that they really attracted a bunch of very passionate teachers.
I remember Ms. (Dorothy) Macinerney, my math teacher, Mr. (Don) Saesar, my science teacher, Ms. (Ann) Pappavasiliou, my reading teacher.
Ms. (Celestine) Barnes was my social studies teacher.
You don’t fully appreciate it when you are little.
But seen from a distance, I can now think back and realize how these teachers genuinely cared.
You know, people who go into teaching do it because they think it is important.
They are very, very pure-hearted.Q: As a child, what did you want to do when you grew up?
A: It changed a lot, but I remember when I was in second or third grade, I wanted to be an archaeologist — and this was pre-Indiana Jones.Later, I wanted to be an astronaut.
Maybe archaeologist is a little weird, but an astronaut is a childhood classic.
I'd still love to be an astronaut.Q:What is it like returning to your elementary school as one of the nation's wealthiest and most prominent entrepreneurs?Most PopularKPRC 2 anchor Syan Rhodes announces her departure from channelEvan Gattis revives Astros sign-stealing scandal on social mediaMessage in a bottle washes up on Texas beach after 1,400-mile journeyCongressman Dan Crenshaw embarrasses himself boycotting Bud LightMissing Texas woman found alive in Jeep submerged in lakeVideo: Lamar High student punches teacher in face after heated exchangeWhy we shouldn't worry about the invasive Australian Redclaw Crayfish—yet.A:When you come back, your elementary school, as I found out today, looks the same except everything is smaller than you remember.
It feels great to come back and see the place.
I feel very, very privileged.
I feel unbelievably lucky, and as I told the kids, one of the most important things for life happiness is to be cognizant as often as possible about what kind of luck and fortune and privileges you've had in your life.
I wish every public school in this country were as good as the River Oaks Elementary program.Q:Tell us about your first computer at River Oaks.A:In fourth grade, we got this teletype ... and it sat out in the hallway outside Ms. Macinerney's room.
We would get some time on it during the day, but the kids who were interested in it, and there were a number of us, would stay after school.
... And we started out initially teaching ourselves how to program it and just reading the manuals and so on, and we did some very, very simple things.
... All that came to a grinding halt when we realized the mainframe computer was preprogrammed to play a very primitive version ofStar Trek.
And as soon as we discovered that, that was like a magnetic attracter, and so every spare moment we got, we were on that computer playingStar Trek.Q: I know kids dream, but did you ever dream this big when you were little, that you would be where you are today?A:No, no, no.
I was dreaming big, but I was dreaming of being an astronaut.ShoppingSee all the Best of Houston maps7 cookbooks on Amazon for moms who love to cookThe Always Pan 2.0 is out now from Our PlaceStock up on Maud's K-cups during this sale at Amazonlululemon just launched its newest golf collection for menDyson hair dryers are $160 off at WalmartMost PopularKPRC 2 anchor Syan Rhodes announces her departure from channelEvan Gattis revives Astros sign-stealing scandal on social mediaMessage in a bottle washes up on Texas beach after 1,400-mile journeyCongressman Dan Crenshaw embarrasses himself boycotting Bud LightMissing Texas woman found alive in Jeep submerged in lakeVideo: Lamar High student punches teacher in face after heated exchangeWhy we shouldn't worry about the invasive Australian Redclaw Crayfish—yet.Shopping7 dog-friendly national parks that welcome your pupThink you have to leave your furry friends behind when you visit a national park?

We've received your submission.Back to ReadingNovember 4, 20215:33pmUpdatedNovember 8, 202111:55pmJeff Bezos just shelled out $78 million for a massive Hawaiian estate spanning over 14 acres, The Post can confirm.But the Amazon founder has only hit the tip of the iceberg when it comes to investing in the Aloha State —which has locals worried.Sources tell The Post that Bezos, 57, is scouting off-the-market ranches in Maui after buying property on Valley Isle’s south shore, known as La Perouse Bay.Jeff Bezos drops $78 million for a 14-acre Maui, Hawaii, estate with his own private bay.Ethan KwonBezos had also been hoping to find a four-bedroom penthouse in Montage Kapalua Bay — a rarity at the luxury resort where he often stays — for his parents, located on the other side of Maui island from the estate he purchased in June.The entrepreneur-turned-astronaut purchased three different structures on his own private bay, with additional acreage under the Lochland Holdings LLC, property records reveal.The main property spans 4,450 square feet.Ethan KwonThe bay is extremely secluded and no commercial activity is allowed of any kind.Ethan KwonThe estate is surrounded by dormant lava fields.Ethan KwonBezos purchased the LLC from the Schatz family, the previous owners of the estate.
Doug Schatz, a Colorado-based energy businessman, bought the property in 1996 for $4.2 million, and in the following years, he spent a few million more to buy the neighboring land.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who owns more than 1,300 acres of land on the island of Kauai, has reportedly spent over $100 million for hisreal estate transactions on the island.Locals told The Post they have mixed feelings abouttech moguls taking overthe island.see alsoalexaTech billionaires battle it out for best Hawaii resort“It is tough being born and raised here, seeing these real estate transactions and how it can drive up prices,” one source said.
On the island, an average home now costs 1 million — way above what most blue-collar workers can afford, so I always struggle with that.”But on the other hand, the source mused that some of these “big-money” investors have really helped Hawaii, includingLarry Ellison, who purchased 98% of Lanai in 2012 and moved to the island full-time in December.“On the other side of the coin you have Ellison — he improved so much of the infrastructure, like the Pineapple Plantation,” the insider said.
You had parks deteriorating, infrastructure was in decay and he brought it back to life, essentially.“It’s hard to know what Bezos’ intentions are this early on,” the source added.Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos attend the Amazon Prime Video celebration on Jan. 16, 2020, in Mumbai, India.According toPacific Business News, Bezos and his partner, Lauren Sanchez, “want to be a part of supporting the local community” and have donated to several charities in Maui, including Friends of the Children’s Justice Center of Maui, Malama Family Recovery Center, the Maui Farm, Ka Hale A Ke Ola Homeless Resource Centers and Habitat for Humanity Maui.Anthony Sayles, a local real estate agent with Coldwell Banker Island Properties, who was born and raised on Maui, revealed the bay property Bezos purchased was once a place he frequented when he was a kid in elementary school, describing the space as “very unique.”“At that time, it was rustic.
It has since seen several renovations.
Having your own private bay, it is something like out of ‘Gilligan’s Island,'” Sayles told The Post.Jeff Bezos is hoping to buy more property on Maui in the near future.Ethan Kwon“It’s very private from car access, so you can’t see the house if you’re driving by.
It’s barricaded.
You have to pass through several gates to get in and there is around-the-clock security.”Sayles explained that the bay is considered a marine fishing reserve area, which makes it rare for individuals to have access to the waters, and fishing by boat is not allowed.The estate is also surrounded by thousands of acres of dormant lava fields where the Haleakalā volcano erupted over 400 years ago.“My main memory is the coral floors and walking around barefoot.
It felt like you were outside living ‘Gilligan’s Island’ style,” Sayles reiterated.Even by Hawaii standards, this oceanfront estate is isolated and remote and is made up of three separate structures.see alsoJeff Bezos’ $500M real estate portfolio: See all his luxury housesThe main structure holds three bedrooms and three bathrooms and spans 4,450 square feet.
The second property is a two-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom guesthouse with 1,839 square feet.
The third structure has three bedrooms and one bathroom and comes with 1,815 square feet of space.While $78 million may seem overpriced for the secluded abode, a smaller estate nearbysold for $45 millionlast summer.
At the time, it was known as the second-most expensive real estate transaction in the state.Bezos is considered the second-richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of $191.4 billion,according to Forbes.In addition to the $78 million Hawaiian property, he has a$500 million real estate portfolio, with properties in California, Texas, Washington and New York.Share this article:FacebookTwitterFlipboardWhatsAppEmailCopyFiled underamazonCelebrity Real Estatehawaiijeff bezoslauren sanchezluxury real estatemauiresidential real estatesurreal estate11/4/21Read NextJerry Stiller and Anne Meara's UWS home in contract with $...what to shop nowAn Adele super fan told us everything you need to know about her Vegas showsConstruction underway: Pick up this 790-Piece LEGO Brick Box for over 40% off today on AmazonA breath of fresh air: Save $100 on a Dyson Pure Cool Air Purifier Fan today on AmazonSmile!

First of all, of course, I'm interested in space, because I'm passionate about it.
I've been studying it and thinking about it since I was a 5-year-old boy," says Bezos.
But that is not why I'm pursuing this work.
Bezos — who iscurrently worth $130 billion, according to Forbes — says if humanity does not become multiplanetary, eventually it will stagnate.
I'm pursuing this work, because I believe if we don't, we will eventually end up with a civilization of stasis, which I find very demoralizing.
I don't want my great-grandchildren's great-grandchildren to live in a civilization of stasis.
We all enjoy a dynamic civilization of growth and change," says Bezos.Billionaire tech entrepreneur and SpaceX bossElon Muskis also inspired by a future of getting to space.
Fundamentally, the future is vastly more exciting and interesting if we are a space faring civilization and multi planetary species than if we are not,"Musk has said.To illustrate how civilization will stagnate if it remains Earth-locked, Bezos uses the problem of energy consumption.VIDEO1:0501:05Jeff Bezos is the world’s richest personMake It"For a century or more, it's been compounding at a few percent a year, our energy usage as a civilization," says Bezos.
Now if you take baseline energy usage globally across the whole world and compound it at just a few percent a year for just a few hundred years, you have to cover the entire surface of the Earth in solar cells.
That's the real energy crisis.
And it's happening soon.
And by soon, I mean within just a few hundred years.
We don't actually have that much time.
So what can you do?
Well, you can have a life of stasis, where you cap how much energy we get to use," says Bezos.
But to the billionaire entrepreneur and tech executive, that is not an acceptable fate: "[S]tasis would be very bad, I think.
Alternatively, says Bezos, humanity can expand into space, allowing for exponential growth.
Now take the scenario, where you move out into the solar system.
The solar system can easily support a trillion humans," says Bezos.
And if we had a trillion humans, we would have a thousand Einsteins and a thousand Mozarts and unlimited, for all practical purposes, resources and solar power unlimited for all practical purposes.
That's the world that I want my great-grandchildren's great-grandchildren to live in.
As humanity expands into space, the Earth will remain the crown jewel, says Bezos.
By the way, I believe that in that timeframe we will move all heavy industry off of Earth and Earth will be zoned residential and light industry.
It will basically be a very beautiful planet," says Bezos.
We have sent robotic probes to every planet in this solar system now and believe me this is the best one.
Bezos is taking the first step in his master plan to colonize space with his company Blue Origin.
I believe and I get increasing conviction with every passing year, that Blue Origin, the space company, is the most important work that I'm doing.
And so there is a whole plan for Blue Origin," says Bezos.On Sunday, Blue Originsuccessfully launched its New Shepard rocketfor the first time in 2018 from its facility near Van Horn, Texas.
The company hopes to send humans to space as early as this year, butCEO Bob Smith says that will only happenwhen the company is completely sure the travel will be safe.The fundamental first step in building a future where civilization lives between Earth and space is to be able to use rockets more than once, says Bezos.
The key is reusability," says Bezos.
This civilization I'm talking about of getting comfortable living and working in space and having millions of people and then billions of people and then finally a trillion people in space — you can't do that with space vehicles that you use once and then throw away.
It's a ridiculous, costly way to get into space.

AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez)VAN HORN, Texas (AP) — Jeff Bezos blasted into space Tuesday on his rocket company’s first flight with people on board, becoming the second billionaire in just over a week to ride his own spacecraft.The Amazon founder was accompanied by a hand-picked group: his brother, an 18-year-old from the Netherlands and an 82-year-old aviation pioneer from Texas — the youngest and oldest to ever fly in space.“Best day ever!” Bezos said when the capsule touched down on the desert floor in remote West Texas after the 10-minute flight.Named after America’s first astronaut, Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket soared on the 52nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, a date chosen by Bezos for its historical significance.
He held fast to it, even as Virgin Galactic’s Richard Branson pushed up his own flight from New Mexico and beat him to space by nine days.The two private companies chasing space tourism dollars, though, have drawn criticism for catering to the rich while so many are struggling amid the pandemic.During Tuesday’s flight, Blue Origin’s capsule reached an altitude of about 66 miles (106 kilometers), more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) higher than Branson’s July 11 ride.
The 60-foot (18-meter) booster accelerated to Mach 3 or three times the speed of sound to get the capsule high enough, before separating and landing upright.ADVERTISEMENTUnlike Branson’s piloted rocket plane, Bezos’ capsule was completely automated and required no official staff on board for the up-and-down flight.During their several minutes of weightlessness, video from inside the capsule showed the four floating, doing somersaults, tossing Skittles candies and throwing balls, with lots of cheering, whooping and exclamations of “Wow!” The Bezos brothers also joined their palms to display a “HI MOM” greeting written on their hands.
The capsule landed under parachutes, with Bezos and his guests briefly experiencing nearly six times the force of gravity, or 6 G’s, on the way back.Led by Bezos, they climbed out of the capsule after touchdown with wide grins, embracing parents, partners and children, then popped open bottles of sparkling wine, spraying one another.“My expectations were high and they were dramatically exceeded,” Bezos said later.Their flight lasted 10 minutes and 10 seconds — five minutes shy of Alan Shepard’s Freedom 7 flight in 1961.
Shepard’s daughters, Laura and Julie, were introduced at a press event a few hours later.Sharing Bezos’ dream-come-true adventure was Wally Funk, from the Dallas area, one of 13 female pilots who went through the same tests as NASA’s all-male astronaut corps in the early 1960s but never made it into space.“I’ve been waiting a long time to finally get it up there,” Funk said.“I want to go again — fast,” she added.Joining them on the ultimate joyride was the company’s first paying customer, Oliver Daemen, a last-minute fill-in for the mystery winner of a $28 million charity auction who opted for a later flight.
The Dutch teen’s father took part in the auction, and agreed on a lower undisclosed price last week when Blue Origin offered his son the vacated seat.More on space tourism–Blue Origin brings space tourism to tiny Texas town–Richard Branson's flight sparks new optimism in New Mexico–Billionaire Richard Branson reaches space in his own ship“It was so amazing,” Daemen said.
Let’s hope that many, many more people can do this.”Four hours after their flight, Bezos drove his crew over to see the rocket that carried them safely to space.Among the items brought on the flight: A pair of aviator Amelia Earhart’s goggles and a piece of fabric from the original Wright Flyer.“I got goose bumps,” said Angel Herrera of El Paso, who watched the launch from inside Van Horn High School, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) away.
The hair on the back of my neck stood up, just witnessing history.”No one is rushing to buy a ticket from this bleak and isolated town.“This ride is only for the wealthy,” pizza shop owner Jesus Ramirez said after watching the launch, adding that he hoped the venture would attract businesses to the town and provide opportunities for local companies.Blue Origin — founded by Bezos in 2000 in Kent, Washington, near Amazon’s Seattle headquarters — hasn’t revealed its price for a ride to space but has lined up spots for other auction bidders.
Ticket sales, including the auction, are approaching $100 million, Bezos said.
Two more flights are planned by year’s end.The recycled rocket and capsule used Tuesday flew on the last two space demos, according to company officials.Virgin Galactic already has more than 600 reservations at $250,000 apiece.
Founded by Branson in 2004, the company has sent crew into space four times and plans two more test flights from New Mexico before launching customers next year.Blue Origin’s approach was slower and more deliberate.
After 15 successful unoccupied test flights to space since 2015, Bezos finally declared it was time to put people on board.
The Federal Aviation Administration agreed last week, approving the commercial space license.Bezos, 57, who also owns The Washington Post, claimed the first seat.
The next went to his 50-year-old brother, Mark Bezos, an investor and volunteer firefighter, then Funk and Daemen.
They spent two days together in training.University of Chicago space historian Jordan Bimm said the passenger makeup is truly remarkable.
Imagine if the head of NASA decided he wanted to launch in 1961 instead of Shepard on the first U.S. spaceflight, he said in an email.“That would have been unthinkable!” Bimm said.
It shows just how much the idea of who and what space is for has changed in the last 60 years.”Bezos stepped down this month as Amazon’s CEO and last week donated $200 million to renovate the National Air and Space Museum.Fewer than 600 people have reached the edge of space or beyond.
Until Tuesday, the youngest was 25-year-old Soviet cosmonaut Gherman Titov and the oldest at 77 was Mercury-turned-shuttle astronaut John Glenn.Both Bezos and Branson want to drastically increase those overall numbers, as does SpaceX’s Elon Musk, who’s skipping brief space hops and sending his private clients straight to orbit for tens of millions apiece, with the first flight coming up in September.“We’re going to build a road to space so our kids and their kids can build the future,” Bezos said.
We need to do that to solve the problems here on Earth.”Despite appearances, Bezos and Branson insist they weren’t trying to outdo each other by strapping in themselves.
Bezos noted this week that only one person can lay claim to being first in space: Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, who rocketed into orbit on April 12, 1961.Branson sent a congratulatory tweet: “Impressive!
Very best to all the crew from me and all the team” at Virgin Galactic.Blue Origin is working on a massive rocket, New Glenn, to put payloads and people into orbit from Cape Canaveral, Florida.
The company also wants to put astronauts back on the moon with its proposed lunar lander Blue Moon; it’s challenging NASA’s sole contract award to SpaceX.Included in the many people that Bezos thanked Tuesday was “every Amazon employee and every Amazon customer.
Because you guys paid for all this.” Bezos has said he finances the rocket company by selling $1 billion in Amazon stock each year.___AP reporters Sean Murphy in Van Horn and Candice Choi in New York contributed to this report.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Now, Bezos will step aside as CEO after 27 years and tens of billions in gains.
In authorBrad Stone's 2013 bookon the origins of Amazon, he paints a picture of the early days of the company and how it grew into the behemoth that it is today.Jillian D'Onfro contributed to an earlier version of this story.
Amazon" wasn't the company's original name.Amazon / Villages Web DesignJeff Bezos originally wanted to give the company the magical sounding name "Cadabra.
Amazon's first lawyer, Todd Tarbert, convinced him that the name sounded too similar to "Cadaver," especially over the phone.
Bezos also favored the name "Relentless."
If you visit Relentless.com today, it navigates to Amazon.
He finally chose "Amazon" because he liked that the company would be named after the largest river in the world, hence the company's original logo.In the early days of Amazon, a bell would ring in the office every time someone made a purchase, and everyone would gather around to see if they knew the customer.Jeff Bezos in 1999.Photo Nomad Ventures, Inc./Corbis via Getty ImagesIt only took a few weeks before the bell was ringing so frequently that they had to turn it off.In the first month of its launch, Amazon had already sold books to people in all 50 states and in 45 different countries.An obscure book about lichens saved Amazon from going bankrupt.Jeff Bezos in 1997.Paul Souders/Getty ImagesBook distributors required retailers to order 10 books at a time, and Amazon didn't need that much inventory yet (or have that much money).So, the team discovered a loophole: Although the distributors required that Amazonorder10 books, the company didn't need toreceivethat many.
So, they would order one book they needed, and nine copies of an obscure lichen book, which was always out of stock.Amazon got started out of Bezos' garage.
In the early days, Bezos held meetings at Barnes & Noble.Jeff Bezos in 2001.Ted Soqui/Corbis via Getty ImagesIn the early days of Amazon, the servers that the company used required so much power that Bezos and his wife couldn't run a hair dryer or a vacuum in the house without blowing a fuse.Jeff Bezos expected employees to work 60-hour weeks, at least.
The idea of work-life balance didn't exist.Jeff Bezos in France in 2000.Yves Forestier/Sygma via Getty ImagesOne early employee worked so tirelessly over eight months — biking back and forth from work in the very early morning and very late night — that he completely forgot about the blue station wagon that he'd parked near his apartment.He never had time to read his mail, and when he finally did, he found a handful of parking tickets, a notice that his car had been towed, a few warnings from the towing company, and a final message that his car had been sold at an auction.Amazon's first intense Christmas season came in 1998.An Amazon book warehouse in France in 2000.Jacques Langevin/Sygma/Sygma via Getty ImagesThe company was dramatically under-staffed.
Every employee had to take a graveyard shift in the fulfillment centers to meet orders.
They would bring their friends and family and would often sleep in their cars before going to work the next day.After that, Amazon vowed that it would never have a shortage of labor to meet demand for the holidays again, which is why Amazon hires so many seasonal workers today.When eBay launched onto the scene, Amazon tried to build its own auction site to compete.The cave bear skeleton in the lobby at Amazon HQ.Business InsiderThe idea flopped, but Bezos himself loved it.He purchased a $40,000 skeleton of an Ice Age cave bear and displayed it in the lobby of the company's headquarters.
Next to it was a sign that read "Please Don't Feed The Bear."
It's still there today.Bezos liked to move incredibly fast, which often created chaos, especially in Amazon's distribution centers.An Amazon warehouse in 2007.JENS-ULRICH KOCH/DDP/AFP via Getty ImagesAmazon suffered extreme growing pains in the late '90s and early 2000s.
Facilities would get shut down for hours because of system outages, piles of products would sit around ignored by workers, and there was no preparation for new product categories.When the kitchen category was introduced, knives without protective packaging would come hurtling down conveyor shoots.
It was extremely dangerous.In early 2002, Bezos introduced the concept of "two-pizza teams" to Amazon.Jeff Bezos in France in 2000.Yves Forestier/Sygma via Getty ImagesEmployees would be organized into groups of fewer than 10 people — the perfect number to be satisfied by two pizzas for dinner — and were expected to work autonomously.
Teams had to set strict goals, with equations to measure their success.
Those equations were called "fitness functions," and tracking those goals was how Bezos managed his teams.
Communication is a sign of dysfunction," Bezos said.
It means people aren't working together in a close, organic way.
We should be trying to figure out a way for teams to communicate less with each other, not more.
Many employees hated "two-pizza teams," and especially the stress of the fitness functions.Dissatisfied customers can email Jeff Bezos directly and he'll forward the message along to the right person, with one dreaded addition: "?

They've typically got a few hours to solve whatever issue the CEO has flagged and prepare a thorough explanation for how it occurred, a response that will be reviewed by a succession of managers before the answer is presented to Bezos himself.
Such escalations, as these e-mails are known, are Bezos's way of ensuring that the customer's voice is constantly heard inside the company.

On a budget of less than $100,000, Amazon flew photographers to 20 major cities where they rented vehicles to start taking pictures of restaurants.Amazon eventually dropped Block View in 2006, and Google didn't start Street View until 2007.Amazon employees were encouraged to use "primal screams" as therapeutic release during the high-tension holiday season.Jeff Bezos stands on a Segway with Segway inventor Dean Kamen while opening the NASDAQ in November 2002.Mario Tama/Getty ImagesAmazon hires seasonal workers, but the holiday season is still extremely stressful for the logistics teams.In the early 2000s, Jeff Wilke, Amazon's operations manager, would let any person or team who accomplished a significant goal close their eyes, lean back, and yell into the phone at him at the top of their lungs.
Wilke told Brad Stone that some of the primal screams nearly blew out his speakers.Amazon's fulfillment centers have had issues with their working conditions since the beginning, and many unhappy workers have found ways to rebel.ReutersOnce, an employee who was preparing to quit hopped on the fulfillment center's conveyor belt and rode it merrily through the entire facility.One of the wildest stories, however, may be from 2006 and it involves a temporary employee at a Kansas fulfillment center:"He would show up at the start of his shift and leave at the end of it, but he never logged any hours in between.
It took at least a week for anyone to discover what was going on: He had tunneled out a den inside a huge pile of empty wooden pallets.
Completely out of view, he had used Amazon products to make a bed, ripped pictures from Amazon books to line his make-shift walls, and stolen Amazon food to snack on.

It was said that he had hired a leadership coach to try to keep his harsh evaluations in check.Here's an excerpt from Brad Stone's book:"During one memorable meeting, Bezos reprimanded [Diane] Lye and her colleagues in his customarily devastating way, telling them they were stupid and saying they should 'come back in a week when you figure out what you're doing.'

    1:01 pm ET•13 min readUSATSIWelcome to the Friday edition of the Pick Six newsletter!I hope you enjoyed this quiet week around the NFL because things could get chaotic starting next week.
First of all, the combine will be starting on Tuesday with the first batch of players reporting to Indianapolis, although testing won't start until Thursday (Youcan check out our primer on the combine here).After the combine, we'll be heading straight into free agency, and after that we'll be heading straight into the draft.
The offseason is almost crazier than the actual season.
Maybe the offseason should be called the season and the season should be the offseason, because that's what it's starting to feel like around here.All right, let's get to the rundown, where we'll be talking about the wild report about Russell Wilson's final days in Seattle, plus we'll be identifying one free agent target for EACH team.Remember, if you're hanging out with family and/or friends this weekend, you should tell them all to sign up for the newsletter.

Today's show: Players we would use the franchise tag onGetty ImagesFor the Friday episode of the Pick Six Podcast, I teamed up with Will Brinson and Ryan Wilson for a wild show that involved some role playing.
Since the three of us love role playing, we were each given the role of an NFL general manager and we had to decide if we were going to use the franchise tag or not.Here are three of the situations we found ourselves in during the podcast:Ravens GM Eric DeCosta.Ryan Wilson played the role of DeCosta, and Wilson decided that there's a 100% chance that he would tag Lamar Jackson.
At this point, it seems highly unlikely that Jackson and the Ravens will agree to a long-term deal by the time the franchise tag deadline hits on March 7, which makes it a no-brainer to hit Jackson with the tag.
Once you tag him, that gives you another four months to negotiate a long-term deal.
If Jackson ends up playing the season on the tag, that's not the worst thing for Baltimore, because the tag only pays $32.4 million, which is much lower than the $50 million per year he'll likely get if he signs an extension.Bengals owner Mike Brown.I played the role of Brown, and the decision I had to make was whether to tag Jessie Bates III.
The Bengals safety got tagged last year at $12.9 million, which means if he gets tagged again, he'll get a 20% pay bump up to $15.48 million.
Bates is good, but I'm not sure he's worth $15.48 million for one year.
If I'm the Bengals, I have other things to worry about -- like Joe Burrow's contract extension -- and l'll likely let Bates walk if he's hoping to land a long-term deal that pays him $15 million per year or more.Giants GM Joe Schoen.Brinson played the role of Schoen and he had to decide if he should use the tag on Saquon Barkley or Daniel Jones.
Brinson said he would try to get a long-term deal done with Jones, but if that wasn't possible, then he'd use the tag on the quarterback.We also made decisions for the Raiders, Chiefs, Eagles, Cowboys and Jaguars and if you want to hear each of those conversations, then be sureto listen to today's show by clicking here.

Russell Wilson drama: QB apparently tried to get Pete Carroll fired in SeattleBefore getting traded to the Broncos last year, it seems that Russell Wilson attempted to pull off the ultimate power play in Seattle: He tried to get Pete Carroll fired.
That's according to a wildnew story from The Athleticthat doesn't paint a very good picture of Wilson and his actions over the past 12 months.Hereare some of the key details:Wilson wanted Pete Carroll and John Schneider out.Not only did Wilson want the Seahawks to fire Pete Carroll, but he also wanted them to dump general manager John Schneider.
At some point in February 2022, Wilson went to ownership and asked them to make a change.
It didn't take long for Seahawks owner Jody Allen to pick a side.
Just a few weeks after making the demand, the Seahawkstraded Wilson to the Broncos.Wilson wanted Sean Payton to coach the Seahawks.One twist here is that not only did Wilson want a new coach, but his preferred option was the coach who just got hired in Denver, Sean Payton.
Wilson is clearly a fan of Payton, because he's been trying to team up with the former Saints coach for at least two years.
Back in February 2021, Wilsonmade a list of four teamshe would be willing to accept a trade to, and the Saints were on the list and Payton was the coach of the Saints at the time.Wilson's exit from Seattle now makes more sense.When Wilson was traded, Seahawks owner Jody Allen said the QB"made it clear he wanted this change"and that makes more sense now.
If Wilson was unwilling to play for Carroll and the Seahawks weren't going to fire him, then trading him away would've become the only viable option.Wilson denies asking for Carroll to get hired.The Broncos QBresponded to The Athletic's reporton Friday morning with a tweet, "I love Pete and he was a father figure to me and John believed in me and drafted me as well.
I never wanted them fired.
All any of us wanted was to win," Wilson wrote.
Although it's possible Wilson didn't technically request for Carroll to be fired, it's not crazy to think that he put the Seahawks in a situation where he said something along the lines of "Carroll goes or I go" and if that happened, we all know what Seattle decided.Things got kind of weird during Wilson's first year in Denver.Not only did Wilson have his own office at the Broncos' practice facility, but he expected other offensive players to watch film with him on Tuesdays, which is normally a day off for everyone.
Wilson's personal quarterback coach, Jake Heaps, would participate in these meetings even though he had no affiliation with the team.Right now, the Seahawks are definitely getting the last laugh in all of this drama.
Carroll got the Seahawks to the playoffs in 2022, proving that he didn't need Wilson.
On the other hand, Wilson looked washed up during his first season in Denver.
Payton can salvage the Wilson trade for the Broncos if he can fix the QB, but if Wilson doesn't improve in 2023, the Broncos could end up on the losing end of what would become one of the most lopsided trades in NFL history.3.
Jeff Bezos seems to be eyeing a bid for the CommandersGetty ImagesAftersitting out the first round of bidding, it appears that Jeff Bezos might now be interested in buying the Washington Commanders.Here'swhat we know about the situation:Bezos has hired an investment firm.The Amazon founder has hired the investment firm of Allen & Company,according to theWashington Post.
The reason this is notable is because this same firm handled the sales of the last two NFL teams that went on the market (Panthers in 2018 and Broncos in 2022).Bezos has been interested in becoming an NFL owner for at least four years.As CBS Sports reported back in 2019, Bezos spent some timegetting close with several ownersback then and he had "strong support within the league" to become an owner at that point.
Since that report from November 2019, Bezos' ties with the NFL have only grown.
Back in March 2021, Amazon signed an 11-year deal with the league to become the exclusive provider of "Thursday Night Football."
Accordingto CNBC, Amazon is paying the NFL roughly $1 billion per year for the rights.Bezos has ties to the D.C. area.If Bezos is going to buy any team, the Commanders definitely make sense and a big reason for that is because he's already making roots in the area.
Not only does he own theWashington Post, but Amazon's monstrous second headquarters (HQ2) isbeing built in nearby Arlington.No one will be able to outbid Bezos.Money won't be any object for Bezos, who is currently the third-richest man in the world.
According to Forbes live rankings, Bezos isworth a total of $116.8 billion.
It's not clear how much the Commanders will go for, but there's been at least one report suggesting thatDaniel Snyder is hoping to sell the team for $7 billion.Although Bezos has yet to submit a bid for the team, it seems like he's dipping his toe in the water and it won't be surprising if he jumps all the way in by purchasing the Commanders.4.
One free agent every NFL team should prioritize signingWith NFL free agency right around the corner, CBSSports.com's Jordan Dajani decided to make a list of one free agent that each NFL team should prioritize signing this offseason.
If teams are smart, they'll listen to Dajani's recommendations.Dajani made one recommendation for each of the NFL's 32 teams, but we're only going to cover five of them here:Falcons: Lamar Jackson.
I think it's more likely Jackson is franchise-tagged and remains in Baltimore, but if you haven't noticed, it's impossible to predict what will happen in the NFL.
If Jackson is allowed to talk with other teams, the Falcons should be in on him.
Bills: Saquon Barkley.
After spending the majority of the year as the Super Bowl favorites, the front office now faces the sobering reality that maybe they aren't there just yet.
The Bills are still one of the best teams in the NFL, and they may just be one piece away.
That one piece could be a star running back.
Bengals: Dalton Schultz.
Hayden Hurst is a free agent, and he certainly had his moments in 2022.
However, Schultz would be an upgrade and add to this explosive Bengals offensive attack.
Patriots: Odell Beckham Jr."Beckham said healmost signed with the Patriotsjust over a year ago.
Bill Belichick should inquire again.
The Patriots are looking to bolster the offensive side of the ball this offseason and OBJ is a versatile wideout who should have some tread left on the tires.
Buccaneers: Jimmy Garoppolo.
With Tom Brady opting to retire, the Buccaneers need a new quarterback.
Could Brady's former backup finally replace him under center?
Time is a flat circle.

AFC East offseason team needsGetty ImagesOver the past few days, we've been covering the offseason needs for each NFL team by going through every division, and today, we'll be going through the AFC East.Tyler Sullivan went through every team in the division and made a list of their biggest needs that they should be looking to fill this offseason.
One thing you'll notice about the AFC East is that this division isn't in the best financial shape, with three of the four teams currently OVER the salary cap (They don't have to be in compliance with the cap until March 15).BILLSTeam needs:IOL, CB, RB, WR, SCap space:-$18.71 million (Yes, that's a negative sign)Outlook:"The Bills have a couple of heavy hitters set to hit free agency in safety Jordan Poyer, guard Rodger Saffold and inside linebacker Tremaine Edmunds.
First and foremost, they'll need to get cap-compliant and get their books in order to make a run at not only trying to re-sign these stars but add even more talent onto the roster.
PATRIOTSTeam needs:OT, WR, LB, DBCap space:$37.82 millionOutlook:"The status of Jonathan Jones (unrestricted free agent) and safety Devin McCourty (mulling retirement) are major question marks in the secondary.
Adding more bodies to the defensive backfield should be among the priorities, especially if McCourty calls it a career.
DOLPHINSTeam needs:OT, OG, TE, RB, LBCap space:-$12.67 million (Yes, that's a negative sign)Outlook:"The Dolphins spent big along the offensive line last offseason by bringing in left tackle Terron Armstead and center Connor Williams, but the unit still needs more to help keep Tagovailoa upright.
Specifically, the right tackle and guard spots were the big issue for Miami, which will need to improve in some capacity in 2023.
JETSTeam needs:QB, OL, S, DT, LBCap space:-$2.45 millionOutlook:"The major thing holding the Jets back from being a contender is the quarterback position.
This offseason, the Jets do seem hellbent on trying to upgrade at that spot by any means possible and could look to swing big.
They've already hosted recently released Raiders quarterback Derek Carr and are also expected to be in the market for Aaron Rodgers if he and the Packers decide to part ways.

Rapid-fire roundup: Rams set to cut All-Pro linebackerIt's been a busy 24 hours in the NFL, and since it's nearly impossible to keep track of everything that happened, I went ahead and put together a roundup for you, and that roundup involves a lot of coordinator firings.Rams to part ways with Bobby Wagner.The Rams are way over the salary cap, and to help them get under, they have decided to part ways with Bobby Wagner, who was just one season into a five-year, $50 million deal.
The move will save $5 million in cap space.
The upside for Wagner is that he's now a free agent and he's coming off an impressive season where he was named a second-team All-Pro, which means he should be a hot commodity.
We took a look at several possible landing spots for Wagner, andyou can check those out here.Broncos hire Giants backup QB from last season.Giants backup QB Davis Webb is headed to Denver, except he's not headed there as a player.
The 28-year-old has retired from football and willnow be joining the Broncos as their QB coach.
This means that Russell Wilson will now be coached by a guy who only started one career NFL game.
To put that in perspective, Wilson has started in more Super Bowls (2) than Webb did in regular season games (1).Broncos expected to hire former Chargers offensive coordinator.In another coaching move, the Broncos are expected to hire Joe Lombardi to join their offensive staff, accordingto 9News.com.
Lombardi spent the past two seasons as the Chargers offensive coordinator before being fired in January.Patrick Mahomes defends Eric Bieniemy.The Chiefs QBtook to Twitter on Thursdayto defend his former offensive coordinator, who got ripped by LeSean McCoy earlier this week, "There should be no questions on how great of a man/coach Coach Bienemy is," Mahomes wrote.

Here’s what it taught him about managementBYJane ThierAugust 29, 2022, 7:25 PM UTCWorking at McDonald’s taught Jeff Bezos a lot about business—and cracking eggs with one hand.Rodin Eckenroth—WireImage/Getty ImagesIn the early 1980s, you could find 16-year-old Jeff Bezos, a student at Miami Palmetto Senior High, working as a short-order line cook during the breakfast shift at McDonald’s before the sun rose each morning.Bezos, now the world’s second-richest man with a$159 billion net worth, reminded his followers of his humble originswith a tweet Sunday.
My first job.
And still the same great burger.
Happy Sunday!” he wrote, attaching a photo of himself eating a McDonald’s burger with fries.My first job.
Happy Sunday!pic.twitter.com/3slx6dHUVa— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos)August 28, 2022It’s not the first time Bezos has been open about working at McDonald’s, which began because he needed a summer job.
His father worked there at a young age, too.
In interviews over the years, Bezos has remarked on how flipping burgers helped him learn managerial skills, gain responsibility, and have fun.His time at the chain started with a bang, he told Cody Teets, author ofGolden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers That Began at McDonald’s.
My first week on the job, a five-gallon, wall-mounted ketchup dispenser got stuck open in the kitchen and dumped a prodigious quantity of ketchup into every hard-to-reach kitchen crevice,” he said.
Since I was the new guy, they handed me the cleaning solution and said, ‘Get going!’”His McDonald’s manager was excellent, he told Teets.
He had a lot of teenagers working for him, and he kept us focused even while we had fun.”He added that he was a strictly back-of-house employee throughout his tenure and never worked the registers.
The most challenging thing was keeping everything going at the right pace during a rush,” he said.It taught him that customer service jobs of all kinds are “really hard,” hetoldFast Companyin 2001.
I was a cook.
They wouldn’t let me anywhere near the customers.
This was my acned-teenager stage.
They were like, ‘Hmm, why don’t you work in the back?’”The burger-flipping didn’t provide much in the way of practical skills, however.
He added that one of the great gifts the job gave him was the ability to crack eggs with one hand.“My favorite shift was Saturday morning.
The first thing I would do is get a big bowl and crack 300 eggs into it,” Bezos said.
One of the things that’s really fun about working at McDonald’s is to get really fast at all of this stuff.
See how many eggs you can crack in a period of time and still not get any shell in them.”However, some may say that Bezos didn’t necessarily implement all he learned during his time at McDonald’s when he became CEO ofAmazon.
Critics and legislators haverepeatedly accused the businessof treating its warehouse and delivery workers unfairly and dangerously.
In 2018, author James Bloodworthwent undercover at an Amazon fulfillment centerand reported that warehouse employees were written up for any kind of breaks, including to use a bathroom.
Amazonhas denied this, but many workershave confirmed it, andnumerous Amazon facilitiesacross the country have filed for union representation.But Bezos considers his experience valuable.
He told Teets he encourages young people to work in jobs such as a McDonald’s line cook.“You can learn responsibility in any job, if you take it seriously,” he said.
You learn a lot as a teenager working at McDonald’s.

His mother Jacklyn, who became became pregnant with Bezosat 16, remembers his fascination with discovering the way machines and toys worked.
I knew early on that he was wired a little bit differently,"she says.
When he tried to take his crib apart with a screwdriver, I think that cinched it.
tweetSo when 16-year-old Jeff got a summer job frying up burgers at McDonald's in 1980, he learned all he could from the experience.Jeff Bezos | Instagram"I was a cook,"Bezos told Fast Company.
They wouldn't let me anywhere near the customers.
They were like, 'Hmm, why don't you work in the back?'"
he joked.As a "grill man," the most challenging thing for Bezos "was keeping everything going at the right pace during a rush," he told Cody Teets, author of "Golden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers That Began at McDonald's.
The experience was Bezos' first hands-on brush with retail,according to Wired, and he spent the summer "studying the company's automation improvements," like beeps and signals for when to "scramble his eggs, flip his burgers, and pull his fries out of the boiling vat.
The job also gave him early insight into customer service: "I learned that it's really hard," he told Fast Company.
Today, "customer obsession" is the first one of Amazon's leadership principles.Bezos isn't the only entrepreneur to glean lessons from working at a fast-food chain.
Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian wasa waiter at Pizza Hut in high school, after working his way up from a dishwasher.As a waiter, "I learned basically everything I've ever needed to know about customer service," Ohanian toldThe New York Times.Barbara Corcoran, star of ABC's "Shark Tank, found similar value working as a waitress in her early 20s.
You learn more in waitressing than you can in any other job," Corcorantells CNBC Make It.
The best job you could have to prepare for entrepreneurship is, walk on the other side of the counter and serve people.
As for Bezos's time at McDonald's, his advice for young people is to always keep your eyes open for lessons to learn at any gig, even it's just flipping burgers.
You can learn responsibility in any job, if you take it seriously," he said in "Golden Opportunity.
You learn a lot as a teenager working at McDonald's," he said.
It's different from what you learn in school.
Don't underestimate the value of that!

27, 2021Answering "Hire and develop the best" Amazon interview questionAmazon’s leadership principles are one of its most valuable assets.
Not only does it drive their company success, but it also gives them a competitive edge over other companies in the industry.ShareTweetCopy linkIfyou want to be a successful leader at Amazon or just get hired by them, then this leadership principle is one you must follow.The principle, in Amazon’s words“Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion.
They recognize exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organization.
Leaders develop leaders and take their role in coaching others seriously.
We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.”What does this principle mean?According to this principle, leaders should hire and promote the best people.
Leaders should recognize exceptional talent.
Leaders must help their employees develop themselves.
That’s why they must be willing to move high-performing individuals throughout the organization.
Since leaders are responsible for the success of their employees,they need to take coaching seriously, and they should consider developing leaders as one of their primary responsibilities.If you want to be a successful leader at Amazon or just get hired by them, you must follow this principle while working on your application process.
Keep in mind that Amazon employs only the best people, so you should always try to compete with them or exceed their expectations.According to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, this principle was the first one that his company embraced when he started building it in 1994.
And since then, they’ve been following it every day.
They chose this principle to guide them because they wanted to build a company that would last for decades and centuries, and it would be able to show clearly what good leadership means.Even though the first idea of Amazon was just creating an online bookstore, Bezos has always focused on finding the best people he could hire.
He knew that to create a world-class company, they needed exceptional people.
He believed that if he found these people and hired them, the rest would be just a matter of time until they became successful.Why is this leadership principle beneficial for Amazon?The main advantage of following this principle is that Amazon gets to have a competitive advantage due to having highly talented employees who are ready to do everything that it takes to ensure customers are satisfied with their experience.
It also encourages high-performing employees to stay with the company since they get a lot of support and opportunities to grow further.What are they looking for?By hiring and developing the best, Amazon can win against companies that just hire anyone without thinking about whether that person will be beneficial for them in the future.Sample questions related to “Hire and develop the best”What is your management style?What can you tell me that demonstrates your ability to inspire and lead others?What is the most important quality for a good manager at Amazon?Can you please describe an example of when you successfully developed someone?What qualities do you look for in training programs when considering new hires at Amazon?How do you ensure you hire the best people?How do you develop the skills of your team?How can managers communicate with their employees to get the best out of them?How would you rate yourself as a manager, and why?Tell me how you help your team members develop their careers?What was the last situation where you developed your team members?How do you make sure that your employees are achieving their goals?Why should people choose to work at Amazon rather than other companies?Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a conflict between two team members?How do you motivate your team members to perform at their highest level?What qualities make a good manager, in your opinion?When have you been most satisfied in your leadership role?Tips on how to answer these Amazon interview questions and the STAR strategyFor some ofthe Amazon interview questions, you can use specific examples from your previous work experience.
Try to show the interviewer that you can get “the best” out of your employees by giving them challenging assignments that will help them grow and develop their skills.Be prepared with answers that demonstrate your ability to promote people by letting them take on additional responsibilities or giving them essential projects.
Think of a time when you delegated an important task to someone who wasn’t feeling confident about it, but after working on it, they became incredibly proud of the results and were motivated by the challenge.Don’t forget that Amazon always wants to hire people who are not afraid of challenges and who are willing to learn and grow.
Showing you are ready to take on new responsibilities will show them that you really care about your future with the company.When talking about the qualities of a good manager, make sure to name more than just leadership and people skills (that’s what most people say).
For example, you can mention that a good manager is also a good teacher who knows how to communicate with their team in a way everyone can understand.If you have no previous experience, think of a time when you had to lead a project at school or university and follow the steps mentioned above.
We personally like to use the STAR strategy when giving an answer:Situation (tell them what the situation was and how it made you feel)Task (what tasks were involved and what was your role)Action (show them that you took immediate measures to solve the problem)Results (after your actions, explain what the result was - good or bad- and how it felt like to be the leader of that project).Sample answers using the STAR frameworkQuestion 1: Tell me about a time when you had to deal with a conflict between two of your team members?Your Response:Situation: “My team member, James, was angry at Sarah because she didn’t get his work done on time, and he felt that it was her responsibility to do so.Task: “The goal was to find a solution for this conflict between the two team members.Action: “I sat them down together and explained that we have a shared goal as a team, which is to deliver the work on time, so it’s important for them to help each other.
They both agreed that this was a good idea, and they ended up helping each other finish their work on time.”Result: “Later, I noticed that they were talking to each other more, and I could see that they were supporting each other better, so it was nice to see them working together.”Question 2: Can you please describe an example of when you successfully developed someone?Your Response:Situation: “My colleague, Stacy, was very quiet and shy when we first started working together.
She didn’t enjoy speaking in front of a big audience, and she felt like she wouldn’t be able to present her own ideas when we worked on projects.Task: “The task was to help her improve her public speaking skills and show her that she is ready to present her own ideas if necessary.Action: “I started by giving all of my attention to Stacy when we were working on a new presentation together.
I made sure to ask for her opinion first, which really boosted up her confidence as she felt more involved in the project.”Result: “The second time we presented the project to our team, she spoke with confidence, and I could see everyone was listening carefully to what she had to say.
She felt more confident about her work overall.”Question 3: What can you tell me that demonstrates your ability to inspire and lead others?Your Response:Situation: “Once, I had to lead a project which involved the whole department.Task: “My goal was to be able to successfully implement a new event for our clients and motivate my team members throughout the process.
People were afraid of changes, so it wasn’t easy at first, but most of them followed my example.”Action: “I took the lead at the start of the project and showed everyone that I was committed to it.
Then, when someone started to doubt about what we were doing, I’d ask them if they had any ideas for improvements.
That way, everyone felt involved in making it a success.”Result: “The second time I proposed this idea, nobody opposed, so I knew I was on the right track.”This method to answer an interview question is well known because it’s simple yet effective.
The STAR framework works very well for any question, especially the behavioural ones.Give real examplesIt’s essential to keep in mind that you should always give a real example so your interviewer can easily picture what you are talking about and learn more about your leadership skills at the same time.
An example that happened in the past is always better than a story you created yourself because it’s much more convincing and further proves your leadership skills!If you want to hire a great mentor who’ll guide you through your interview process, and help you find the perfect job, click on the links below.Amazon interview preparationAmazon Web Services (AWS) mentorsShareTweetCopy linkSidebarJoin the

Bezos is worth anestimated $196.2 billionand iscurrently the richest person in the world, according to Forbes.But before the 57-year-old became a tech mogul, he didn't always have the Midas touch.
In fact, Bezos spent most of his 20s the way many millennials now do: job-hopping.While in college at Princeton, the future billionaire realized that he couldn't keep up with other students in his honors physics classes, so he switched his major to computer science.
He also committed himself to the idea of one day running his own business, according to a1999 Wired profile on the billionaire.After graduating from college, Bezos turned down positions at several established companies, including Intel, Bell Labs and Anderson Consulting.
Instead, he accepted a job at Fitel, a telecommunications start-up.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 1997.Paul Souders | Hulton Archive | Getty ImagesFitel's main goal was to create a global telecommunications network for trading firms, and Bezos started out debugging lines of code, Wired reports.
He quickly rose through the ranks, eventually landing a role as the head of development and director of customer service.He spent more than two years attempting to grow the business.
But the start-up failed to get off the ground, so Bezos left and took a job as a product manager at Banker's Trust, which is now part of Deutsche Bank.At Banker's Trust, Bezos again advanced and becamevice president, Mic reports.
But Bezos grew bored at Banker's Trust and after only two years there, at age 26, he began preparing to pivot into tech.He took a job at the then two-year-old hedge fund D.E.
Shaw and became one of the company's vice presidents in just four years.
As a V.P., Bezos was tasked with researching new business opportunities on the rapidly growing Internet, which was held tremendous potential in the early 1990s.VIDEO0:4700:47Instacart CEO Apoorva Mehta shares lessons learned from Jeff Bezos and Steve JobsThe Definitive Guide to BusinessAfter making a list of 20 products he could sell online,Business Insider reports, Bezos decided that books were the most viable option.
When he couldn't get D.E.
Shaw on board with the idea, he decided to branch out on his own.
I knew when I was eighty that I would never, for example, think about why I walked away from my 1994 Wall Street bonus right in the middle of the year at the worst possible time,"he saysin "The Everything Store," a biography by Brad Stone.
That kind of thing just isn't something you worry about when you're eighty years old.
At the same time, I knew that I might sincerely regret not having participated in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a revolutionizing event.
When I thought about it that way … it was incredibly easy to make the decision.
His bet on the Internet paid off.

Just in the last year, Amazonacquired Whole Foods, began allowing Amazon Prime membersto watch its movies and TV showson Apple TV,created a camerathat can help you pick out nicer outfits, was granted patents for delivery droneswith wings and legsandmuch more.But back in 1994, when a 30-year-old, newly married Bezos quit his Wall Street job tostart Amazon, the business was pretty simple.
It sold books.
When we opened our doors, we had 10 employees," Bezos tellstechnology blog GeekWire.
I was driving the packages to the post office myself in my 1987 Chevy Blazer and dreaming one day that we might have a forklift.
Only three years later, in 1997,Amazon went publicand Bezos' wealth catapulted to over$12 billion, according to Bloomberg.But you wouldn't have known it by the newly minted billionaire's car.
Despite his windfall, Bezos swapped out his 1987 Chevy Blazer for only a modest upgrade — a Honda Accord.That's according to a profile CBS's Bob Simondid of Bezos in 1999for "60 Minutes," recentlyresurfaced by Geekwire, showing Bezos sporting khakis, a button-down and driving the car.
What's with the Honda?"
Simon asks Bezos.After a laugh, Bezos, who according to The New York Times owned roughly$10 billionin Amazon stock in 1999, responds, "This is a perfectly good car.
During the interview, Simon also discovered Amazon's then-headquarters in Seattle shared a street address withpawn shop, a heroin-needle exchange and a "porno parlor."
And inside, Bezos' desk was made out of a re-purposed wooden door and two-by-four pieces of wood.
In fact, the entire company used desks made of doors as deliberate message,according to the Times.Why so frugal?
It's a symbol of spending money on things that matter to customers and not spending money on things that don't," Bezos explains to Simon.By 2004, Amazon employees werestill using door desks, notes Fast Company.
And in 2013, Bezos was still driving a Honda, though a slightly bigger model, according to Brad Stone's book, "The Everything Store.
Today, Amazon has a $620 billion market cap and reported$43.7 billionin revenue during its third quarter in 2017 alone, a 34 percent increase from the same quarter in 2016.Bezos has somebigger extravagances, like multiple homes, a private jet and Blue Origin.Yet "frugality" remains one of Amazon'score principlesand the company sticks by Bezos' early mentality.
Amazon even gives out an accolade called the "Door Desk Award" to employees who come up with ideas that save money.According to Amazon: "Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention.

You might think that abillionairewith the resources to out-ship the postal service and send craft into space might drive something flashier.
You’d be right, well, partially right.
Here’s why Bezos drives a forgettable 1997 Honda Accord as well as a handful of world-class cars.What car does Jeff Bezos have?Amazon founder and current executive chairman Jeff Bezos drives a 1997 Honda Accord.
While that isn’t his only car, it is one that should grab your attention.
Among the flashiest of billionaires’ rides, Bezos chooses to drive a late 90s Honda sedan.Jeff Bezos poses | Phillip Faraone, Getty ImagesDon’t be mistaken; Jeff Bezos has other cars in his collection.
However, the simple fact that a billionaire would drive a car like the Accord is a head-scratching idea.Why does Jeff Bezos drive a 1997 Honda Accord?Jeff Bezos says he drives a 1997 Honda Accord simply because “[its] a perfectly good car.” Before you judge, he isn’t wrong.
The Honda Accord is synonymous with reliability, affordability, and perhaps what Bezos values, subtlety.
Drive down the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) in a million-dollarhypercar, people notice; drive down the PCH in an Accord, no one bats an eye.A 1990s Honda Accord | Dorrell Tibbs, UnsplashBezos toldCBS’Bob Simon in 1999 that the car represents financial priorities and frugality.
Still, according toCNBC, the billionaire keeps homes, cars, a jet, and his space-dwelling venture, Blue Origin.
However, much like Ludacris and his Acura Legend, it might be valuable for the most powerful of people to remember their roots.A Honda Accord’s badge | Justin Sullivan, Getty ImagesWhat other cars does Jeff Bezos have?In addition to his sensible Honda Accord, Jeff Bezos has a Koenigsegg CCXR Trevita, a special editionBugatti Veyron, and a Lamborghini Veneno.
The list doesn’t end there, though.
The billionaire also has a Mercedes-Benz S450 sedan, a Range Rover, a Cadillac Escalade, and a Ferrari Pininfarina Sergio.However, in a monstrous flex, Bezos also has a Lykan Hypersport.
According toHotCars, Bezos’Lykan Hypersportis one of only seven worldwide.
It makes sense then, that the Amazon founder would cap the collection with something sensible and understated, like his 1997 Honda Accord.Amazon, Jeff Bezos’ company, is very profitable | Artur Widak, Getty ImagesRelatedRobert Downey Jr.’s Car Collection Is Iron Man ApprovedWhich other billionaires drive cheap cars?Mark Zuckerberg, the famed founder of Facebook, drives anAcura TSX.
However, Zuckerberg isn’t alone on the list of famous billionaires with reasonable cars.
Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, has a Mazda B-Series, the new cost of which was a whopping $7,099.
Also, Jim Walton, heir to the Walmart fortune, drives a sensible car.
Walton’s chariot of choice is a Dodge Dakota, a small frame pickup truck.These billionaires, like Jeff Bezos, all have personal fortunes of well over 20 billion dollars each, and they choose to drive cars that cost less than $30,000 new.
Adjusting for depreciation, the vehicles listed above are nearly worthless.
Still, there is something to be said for anonymity.Scroll down to the following article to read more about celebrities and their cars!Tags:AccordCelebritiesHondaInstagramYoutubeFacebookTwitterAbout UsContact UsCareersOwnership funding advertising infoCorrections CommitmentFact checking commitmentEthicsShowbiz Cheat SheetEndgame360Sportscasting© Copyright 2023 Endgame360 Inc.

Mr. Bezos and the crew that flew with him were the first human spaceflight for the company.Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesIt's a big week for Jeff Bezos' inner "Trekkie.
On Wednesday, the Amazon and Blue Origin founder lived out something of a childhood fantasy bylaunchingCaptain James T. Kirk — that is, the "Star Trek" actor who portrayed Kirk, 90-year-oldWilliam Shatner— to the edge of space in a Blue Origin New Shepard rocket.But, that's not all.
In anInstagram poston Tuesday, Bezos revealed that Shatner would take a few special pieces of memorabilia along for the ride: a set of homemade cardboard "Star Trek" toys that the billionaire crafted when he was just 9 years old.The toys appear to be drawn-on cardboard cutouts, made to resemble some of the sci-fi props that Shatner's Kirk and other "Star Trek" characters used on the show.
I made these tricorders and communicator to play 'Star Trek' with my friends when I was 9 years old, and my incredible mom saved them for 48 years," Bezos wrote on Instagram.
Star Trek" debuted on television in 1966, when Bezos was just two years old.Writing about his old toys, Bezos said his mother "dug them up this past week" and that Shatner was game to take them along.
Please don't judge me for the artwork," Bezos joked on Instagram.A screenshot taken from a live handout video on October 13, 2021 shows Jeff Bezos talks to William Shatner after Blue Origin's New Shepard crew capsule landed back in Texas, the United States.Blue Origin | Anadolu Agency | Getty ImagesThe spaceflight took Shatner more than 340,000 feet above the Earth on Wednesday morning, making him the oldest person to ever reach space.
The previous record was set in July, when82-year-old aviation pioneer Wally Funkflew to space alongside Bezos himself.Shatner's flighttook off from Blue Origin's facility in Van Horn, Texas, and lasted 11 minutes before landing safely in the Texas desert.VIDEO1:4301:43Why 83-year-old Star Trek star George Takei does 100 push-ups a dayMake ItBezos' love affair with the "Star Trek" franchise is well-documented.
He once evennamed a dogKamala, after an obscure character from an episode of "Star Trek: The Next Generation," andscored a cameoin the 2016 movie "Star Trek Beyond.
In 2016, Bezos toldThe Washington Postthat he first began obsessing over the show in the fourth grade, when he and a few friends "would play 'Star Trek' almost every day" in their Houston, Texas, neighborhood.
We'd fight over who'd get to be Captain Kirk, or Spock, and somebody used to play the computer, too," Bezos told the Post.
We'd have little cardboard phasers and cardboard tricorders, you know.
Good days.
Bezos has also said "Star Trek" helped inspire him to launch Blue Origin.
And, he told the Post, the series' fictional computer system inspired Amazon's Echo smart speaker.Upon returning to Earth,Shatner thanked Bezosfor a spaceflight that he described as "unbelievable.

ByAndrew Liptak/@AndrewLiptakJul 14, 2019, 4:00 PM UTC|CommentsShare this storyPhoto by Andrew Liptak / The VergeLast year, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezostweeted a picture of himselfat his Mars 2018 conference, walking alongside one of Boston Dynamic’s Spot robots.
Now, a toy company has provided a super-detailed, posable action figure of the world’s richest man, which you can conceivably find, purchase, and keep in your home for reasons we have yet to discern.A company called Ntwrk, a “mobile-first shopping” app, apparently sent the toy to a bunch of tech journalists, although I can’t seem to find any more information on this particular toy, which is perhaps a good thing considering it is disturbingly creepy.In the meantime, I have questions.
Twenty-seven of them, to be exact.Photo by Andrew Liptak / The VergeWhy does a super-detailed, posable action figure of Amazon’s CEO exist?What ill deed did we do to deserve this?Why was this sent to me in the first place?Who thought this was a good idea?What was the pitch meeting for this product like?Who was in the room that approved this concept and began development?How do you go about acquiring the likeness of the world’s richest man to produce an action figure?Photo by Andrew Liptak / The VergeWas Jeff Bezos consulted at any point in the design and development process?If so, what were his notes?What was the expression on Bezos’ face when someone brought up the topic to him?Who was the first person to tell Bezos about this?Did Bezos get one of his own?If so, does he still have it?Why is it so jacked?
That one may actually have an answer.
Photo by Andrew Liptak / The VergeWhy does it have bulging veins?How accurate are the muscles, and what access was provided to Bezos to ensure their accuracy?Who would buy this?What level of Amazon / Bezos fan do you have to be to buy one of these?If I bought one, where would I keep it in my house?Is this something my child should play with?Photo by Andrew Liptak / The VergeCan I buy the Spot robot without the Bezos figure?Bezos has tweeted pictures of himself playing withotherrobots.
Will there be a follow-up release?Will it come with other accessories, like a scale version of an Amazon Echo or a Blue Origin rocket?When commercial space travel becomes more widespread, will someone bring toy Bezos into space?IfToy Storywere real, what would his relationship be like with the rest of the toys in Andy’s room?Should I commission a miniatureStar Trek: Next Generationcostume to turn it into a low-rent Jean Luc Picard?Why do its eyes seem to follow me when I walk across the room?CommentsMost PopularThe best Android phone to buy in 2023The end is nigh for gas-powered carsElon Musk tweets then deletes DMs from Matt Taibbi over his Substack snitYou can try The New York Times’ new math-based puzzle game right nowYouTube is giving Premium subscribers higher-quality video than everyone elseVerge Deals/Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.Email (required)Sign upBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.From our sponsorAdvertiser Content FromMore fromTL;DRApril Fools’ Day 2023: the best and cringiest pranksSome questions for the employees behind Google DocsI gazed into the Genesis GV60’s ‘Crystal Sphere’ and found joyI don’t want to log in to your websiteAdvertiser Content FromThe VergeThe Verge logo.Terms of UsePrivacy NoticeCookie PolicyDo Not Sell Or Share My Personal InfoLicensing FAQAccessibilityPlatform StatusHow We Rate and Review ProductsContactTip UsCommunity GuidelinesAboutEthics StatementThe Verge is a vox media networkAdvertise with usJobs @ Vox Media©2023Vox Media, LLC.

Star Trek" actor William Shatner isdue to blast into space on Wednesdayonboard a rocket made by Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos' space exploration company — and he'll have some special memorabilia with him.Bezos said in an Instagram post on Tuesday that when he was nine years old, he made toy versions of the equipment used onboard the fictional Star Trek ship the Starship Enterprise, and that his mother had kept them for the past 48 years.
She dug them up this past week, and @WilliamShatner has agreed to take them up into space for me tomorrow,"Bezos said in his post.Shatner's flight isdue to last roughly 11 minutes, taking the actor 62 miles above sea-level.
He is due to be accompanied by three other civilian astronauts, with no pilot onboard.
Bezos took asimilar flight on Blue Origin's New Shepard rocketin July.At 90 years old, Shatner is due to become the oldest person to reach the boundary of space.
The record is currently held by 82-year-old aviatorWally Funk, who was on Bezos' July flight.Shatner revealed in an interview withCNNthatBlue Origin astronauts were not allowed to sell the mementos they take into space.Blue Origin has recently come under fire from current and former employees over itswork cultureand safety practices.
In anopen letterpublished late September, a group of current and former Blue Origin employees said theywouldn't feel safe riding onboard Blue Origin's rocket.CBS Newsspoke with five anonymous signatories of the open letter, and two said they would not feel safe riding on a Blue Origin rocket.In response to the open letter, a Blue Origin spokesperson told Insider: "We stand by our safety record and believe that New Shepard is the safest space vehicle ever designed or built.

[+]Texas on Oct. 13, 2021.
Photo by Blue Origin/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesKey FactsThe entertainer and three other private citizens aboard New Shepard reached the edge of the atmosphere at about 340,000 off the ground before safely landing in West Texas, where Bezos and others were there to greet them.The flight lasted a little over 10 minutes,accordingto Blue Origin, and reached a velocity of 2,235 miles per hour.Shatner became the oldest person to ever visit space, and was visibly emotional while speaking to Bezos.Full TranscriptShatner:In a way, it’s indescribable.Bezos:That’s what I thought.
You have to work on it, it’s so hard to describe.Shatner:Not only is it different than what you thought, it happens so quickly.
You know what I... the impression I had, that I never expected to have, is the shooting up... and there’s new sky.
commotion while Bezos opens champagne]Shatner:I can’t tell you what you have ... if — everybody in the world needs to do this.
Everybody in the world needs to see the, um... it’s still too... it was unbelievable, unbelievable.
I mean, you know, the little things, the weightlessness.
But to see the blue color gowhoopby, and now you’re staring into blackness — that’s the thing!
The covering of blue was... the sheet, this blanket, this comforter of blue that we have around us, we think, ‘Oh, that’s blue sky.’ And then suddenly you shoot through it all of a sudden, as though you whip off a sheet off you when you’re asleep, and you’re looking into blackness, into black ugliness, and you look down, there’s the blue down there, and the black up there and it’s... it’s just... there is Mother Earth and comfort, and there is — is there death?
I don’t know, is that death?
Is that the way death is?Whoop, and it’s gone.
Jesus.
It was so moving to me.
This experience, it’s something unbelievable.
You see, yeah, you know, weightless, my stomach went up ... ‘This is so weird!’But not as weird as the covering of blue.
This is what I never expected!
Oh it’s one thing to say ‘Oh the sky and the thing and the fragile’ — it’s all true!
But what isn’t true, what is unknown until you do it is there’s this pillow, there’s this soft blue!
Look at the beauty of that color!
And it’s so thin!
And you’re through it in an instant!
It’s, what a — how thick is it, do we know?
Is it a mile, two miles?
But you’re going 2,000 miles an hour, so you’re through 50 miles, whatever the mathematics ... it’s like a beat and a beat and suddenly you’re through the blue!
And you’re into black!
And you’re into, you know, it’s mysterious and galaxies and things, but what you see is black, and what you see down there is light, and that’s the difference.And not to have this, [to Bezos] you have done something, I mean whatever those other guys are doing, what isn’t, they don’t, I don't know about them.
What you have given me is the most profound experience I can imagine.
I’m so filled with emotion about what just happened, I just... it’s extraordinary, extraordinary.
I hope I never recover from this.
I hope that I can maintain what I feel now, I don’t want to lose it.
It’s so... it’s so much larger than me and life.
It hasn’t got anything to do with the little green planet, the blue orb and the — it has nothing to do with that.
It has to do with the enormity, and the quickness and the suddenness of life and death and the — oh my god.Bezos:It’s so beautiful.Shatner:Beautiful, yes, beautiful in its way, but—Bezos:No, I mean your words.Shatner:Oh my words.Bezos:It’s just amazing.Shatner:I can’t even begin to express what... What I would love to do is to communicate as much as possible the jeopardy, the moment you see how... the vulnerability of everything — it’s so small!
This air which is keeping us alive is thinner than your skin!
It’s a sliver, it’s immeasurably small when you think in terms of the universe.
It’s negligible, this air.
Mars doesn’t have it.
Nothing...
I mean, this... And when you think, wait, carbon dioxide change [sic] to oxygen at, what is it, 20% or something, that level sustains our life — it’s so thin, to dirty it — I mean, that’s another whole subject—Bezos:And you shoot through, what you were saying about shooting through it so fast.Shatner:So quickly!
Fifty miles of—Bezos:—and then you’re just in blackness!Shatner:And you’re in death!
The moment—Bezos:This is life.Shatner:This is life, and that’s death.
And it’s, in an instant you go, ‘Whoa, that’s death!’ That’s what I saw.Bezos:That’s amazing.
That’s amazing.Shatner:I am, I am overwhelmed.
I had no idea.
You know, we were talking earlier before going, ‘Well, you know, it’s going to be different,’ ‘Yeah,’ and whatever that phrase is you have, that you have a different view of things.
It doesn’t begin to explain, to describe what a, well for me, I mean everybody’s gonna...
But — and this is now the commercial — everybody, it would be so important for everybody to have that experience through one means or another.
I mean maybe you could put it on 3D and wear the goggles—Bezos:Yeah.Shatner:—and have that experience.
I mean that’s, that certainly is a technical possibility.
But what you need also... We’re lying there and I’m thinking, ‘This is one delay after another delay,’ we’re lying there, how do I feel, and I’m thinking, ‘I’m a little jittery here,’ and well they moved the [inaudible], ‘Oh, there’s something in the engine, they found an anomaly in the engine,’ ‘They found an anomaly in the engine?’ ‘We’re going to hold a little longer.’ ‘Oh you’re going to hold a little longer?’ And I feel this, you know, the stomach, the biome inside, and I’m thinking, okay, I’m thinking ‘I’m a little nervous here’ — another delay — ‘I’m a little more nervous,’ and then the things start.
By the way, this simulation is, they have to be [inaudible] — it’s only a simulation.
Everything else is much more powerful.Bezos:Doesn’t capture—Shatner:Doesn’t capture the — and besides which, the jeopardy.Bang, this thing hits, you go [imitates shaking], you know.
That wasn’t anything like the simulation.Bezos:The G-force is pulling your skin!Shatner:Yeah, the G-force and your stomach and you’re like, ‘What’s going to happen to me?
Am I going to be able to survive the G-force?’ You feel that.
Am I going to survive it?’ And then I think, ‘Good Lord, you know, just getting up the bloody gantry was enough!’Bezos:[laughs]Shatner:Oh my god what an experience, what a...
Nothing, nothing...Bezos:It looked like you had a moment of camaraderie with your crewmates up there.Shatner:Oh, we all hugged each other.
You know, you share, it’s like being in battle together, really.
And there is this bonding of being in battle.
But you’re also embattled inside yourself.
Oh my goodness.

At the time, her high school administrators told her she would not be permitted to finish her education there.After she was allowed to return under strict conditions, Jacklyn Bezos graduated and later divorced from Jeff Bezos' biological father, Ted Jorgensen,after less than a year of marriage.
Jeff Bezos was just over a year old at the time.
She struggled to make ends meet while working as a secretary and, at one point, didn't even have enough income to afford a phone, CNBC reported.Determined to make life better for her and her son, Bezos enrolled in college classes with professors who permitted her to bring her infant along.

For years, I have been begging Paramount, which is owned by Viacom, to let me be in a 'Star Trek' movie.
I was very persistent, and you can imagine the poor director who got the call, you know, 'You have to let Bezos be in your "Star Trek" movie,'" Bezossaid at the 2016 Pathfinder Awards at Seattle's Museum of Flight.
It was super fun for me.

But of course, he's not an astronaut.
He's an actor.
The 91-year-old Canadian has been an icon since he played Captain Kirk in the originalStar Trekseries, which debuted in 1966.But Captain Kirk, er, William Shatner,didactually go to space — last year, aboard a capsule piloted by Jeff Bezos's company Blue Origin.
Shatner details his experiences in his new memoirBoldly Go.
I was crying," Shatner told NPR.
I didn't know what I was crying about.
I had to go off some place and sit down and think, what's the matter with me?
And I realized I was in grief.
SpaceHubble's 1995 image of a star nursery was amazing.
Take a look at NASA's new versionWhile he wasn't sure what to expect, Shatner did not predictthis.
He had been excited to travel to space, and had thought about it for nearly 60 years, but didn't think he'd be overwhelmed with sadness, or that he'd go through "the strongest feelings of grief" that he's ever experienced.There's a name for what Shatner felt: it's called the "overview effect."
The term was coined by space philosopher Frank White in his 1987 book of the same name.
The overview effect is a cognitive and emotional shift in a person's awareness, their consciousness and their identity when they see the Earth from space," White told NPR.
They're at a distance and they're seeing the Earth ... in the context of the universe.
Enlarge this imageThe overview effect is known to affect astronauts.NASA/Getty Imageshide captiontoggle captionNASA/Getty ImagesThe overview effect is known to affect astronauts.NASA/Getty ImagesThis context was what struck Shatner the most.
It was the death that I saw in space and the lifeforce that I saw coming from the planet — the blue, the beige and the white," he said.
And I realized one was death and the other was life.
According to White, everyone who travels to space experiences an "overview effect" — an emotional or mental reaction strong enough to disrupt that person's previous assumptions about humanity, Earth, and/or the cosmos.
Everyone's overview effect is unique to them, but there are reactions that are more common than others.White has interviewed more than 40 astronauts, and says that Shatner's response is typical.
People often cry when they first see the Earth from space," he said.
I wept for the Earth because I realized it's dying," Shatner said.
I dedicated my book,Boldly Go, to my great-grandchild, who's three now — coming three — and in the dedication, say it's them, those youngsters, who are going to reap what we have sown in terms of the destruction of the Earth.
Astronauts often return with a greater distaste for warAfter traveling to space, astronauts gain a greater understanding of how precious, and delicate, the Earth is.
Many astronauts report that they were aware of climate change and global warming, but they became much more sensitive to the subject after traveling to space.White said that one astronaut told him that the biggest lesson they learned from space travel was "the difference between intellectual knowledge and experiential knowledge.
I saw more clearly than I have, with all the studying and reading I've done, the writhing, slow death of Earth and we on it," Shatner said.
It's a little tiny rock with an onion skin air around it.
That's how fragile it all is.
It's so fragile.
We hang by a thread ... we're just dangling.

Fallon/AFP via Getty ImagesAlthough we are just dangling, Shatner adds that we're dangling together.
We're entangled with each other," he said, decrying conflicts between human beings.
We have a war ... the stupidity of it all is so obvious.
Like Shatner, astronauts often return from space more convinced of the interconnectedness of humanity.
According to White, space travelers return to our planet with "a greater distaste for war and violence, and a desire to do something to improve life back on the surface, because they've seen the truth of our situation.
And although the truth may not be pretty, a more universal perspective can only aid in reconnecting our long disconnected species.
White says that astronauts return more eager than ever to be part of the solution, so that humanity may, one day, live long and prosper.FacebookFlipboardEmailRead & ListenHomeNewsCultureMusicPodcasts & ShowsConnectNewslettersFacebookInstagramPressContact & HelpAbout NPROverviewDiversityAccessibilityEthicsFinancesPublic EditorCorrectionsGet InvolvedSupport Public RadioSponsor NPRNPR CareersNPR ShopNPR EventsNPR ExtraTerms of UsePrivacyYour Privacy ChoicesText OnlySponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsor
Jeff Bezos and Steve Jobs: Both Estranged From Dads and Wild Tech Successes - ABC NewsABC NewsVideoLiveShowsGuns in AmericaInterest Successfully AddedWe'll notify you here with news aboutTurn on desktop notifications for breaking stories about interest?OffOnLOG INStream onJeff Bezos and Steve Jobs: Both Estranged From Dads and Wild Tech SuccessesJeff Bezos' biological father just found out his son runs Amazon.ByCOLLEEN CURRYOctober 12, 2013, 7:12 AM1:42Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon.com, in Seattle, Sept. 24, 2013; Apple CEO Steve Jobs in Cupertino, Calif, Oct. 20, 2010.Ted S. Warren/AP Photo|Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesOct.
12, 2013&#151; --Jeff Bezos was already among the country's most successful men as CEO of Amazon.com, its largest online retailer.
But the billionaire tech mogul can now add membership into an even smaller club of success stories: Those who grew up without their biological fathers.Among Bezos' cohorts are such American success stories as Steve Jobs, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama, all of whom either didn't know or didn't grow up with their biological dads.According to a profile of Bezos by Brad Stone, published this week by Bloomberg Businessweek, Bezos was adopted and raised by his stepfather as a young child and has not seen his biological father since he was a toddler.Bezos' biological parents, Ted and Jackie Jorgensen, met in high school and married as teenagers when Jackie became pregnant with Jeff.
But the pair split when Bezos was young, and Jackie remarried Miguel Bezos, a Cuban immigrant who helped raise Jeff into the CEO he would become, according to Stone's story.Adoption "can affect you in a million different ways," said Adam Pertman, executive director of the Donaldson Adoption Institute and author of the book "Adoption Nation."
You've got nature and nurture, so if you're lucky enough to be born with the good stuff in you and the ability to be successful, and you have a family that nurtures you, then you're onto success.
Earlier this week: Bezos and Dorsey Slammed in New Book ExcerptsPertman pointed out that the difficulties of navigating one's identity through adoption can be difficult, and often lead to issues in life that impede success.
But for some people -- among them Bezos and Jobs -- it can clearly be beneficial or be overcome by a stable adoptive family.
It's often true that adopted people, because of their sense of loss, that bond that breaks between their original family and their new family, feel more compelled to show that they can do it," Pertman said.
It ties into rejection: 'Am I good enough?
Was it because of me?
I'm going to show that I'm worthy and good and won't let anything like that happen again.
Bezos' story is similar to that of Jobs, whose biological father was interviewed by reporters after Jobs was already a successful adult.
Neither Jobs nor Bezos have spoken at length about their biological fathers, but Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have both addressed the difficulties of growing up with absent fathers.
It's a very strange and almost inexplicable phenomenon that so many of our most prominent political and cultural figures -- Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Steve Jobs, John Lennon and Jeff Bezos -- had these unusual or nonexistent relationships with one or both birth parents," Stone wrote in an email to ABC News.Read Up on Bezos's Big Plans for Washington PostStone, whose Bloomberg Businessweek profile is an excerpt from his book "The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon," tracked down Bezos' father to a bike shop he runs in Arizona, and asked him about having a son who is so successful.
According to Stone, Jorgenson had no idea the baby he last saw more than 40 years ago grew up to become one of the most influential corporate titans of our time.
I was floored," Stone told ABC News of the encounter.The encounter was reminiscent of that of Steve Jobs, another tech giant who had no relationship with his biological father after he was adopted as a baby.Abdulfattah "John" Jandali, a Syrian man who fathered Jobs, emailed his son and spoke to the media about wanting to have a relationship with the Apple CEO.
Before Jobs' 2011 death, Jandali said that he hoped to meet with Jobs soon, but didn't want to call him because he feared it would seem like Jandali was only after Jobs' fortune.Jandali spoke to the Wall Street Journal after his son's death, saying that he had almost no contact with Jobs.
Jandali's friends told the Journal that the estrangement was "a source of great sadness" that Jandali kept hidden for years.Similarly, Bezos' estranged biological father was also emotional over his son, according to Stone's story in Businessweek.
The face of his child, frozen in infancy, has been stuck in his mind for nearly half a century," Jorgenson's wife told Stone.Pertman, the psychologist, said that it can be difficult for parents separated from their children through adoption to reconnect, especially when wealth is involved.
It's complicated by his wealth," Pertman said.
He's probably thought about this child for years.
People don't create lives and pretend they didn't happen.
Typically when a birth parent finds out there's a child, they want to know what happened to the life they created," he said.
It's normal.
But the notoriety and money does skew it.

It symobilizes a website link url.Copy LinkRead in appRedeem nowJeff BezosReutersThe last time Jeff Bezos, the 49-year-old CEO and founder of Amazon, saw his biological father, he was three years old.His biological father, whose name is Ted Jorgensen, was 18 when he impregnated Bezos' mother, Jacklyn Gise, who herself was 17.
They were both still in high school at the time.
They got married before their son was born.The marriage lasted only 17 months,reports Brad Stone at Bloomberg Businessweek, who has unearthed astonishing new details about Bezos' family's early years.Gise moved in with her parents becauseJorgensen stayed out late, and drank too much, and was generally an inattentive father and husband says Stone.
He agreed to a divorce, and paid a small amount of child support to Gise when he had money.
Other times he missed the payments.Three years after their divorce, Gise married another man, Miguel Bezos, a Cuban immigrant who taught himself English, and eventually worked at Exxon.
Miguel adopted Jeff, and Jeff took his last name.
Jorgensen had to sign off on the name change, which he did, Stone reports.For a brief period Jorgensen remembered the Bezos name, but through the years he forgot about it, and dropped completely out of touch with his ex-wife and his son.Jorgensen's absence from Bezos' life was so complete that ina 1999 interview with Wired, Bezos said of Jorgensen, "I've never met him," although, in reality he lived with him for the first year of his life.
The reality, as far as I'm concerned, is that my Dad is my natural father.
The only time I ever think about it, genuinely, is when a doctor asks me to fill out a form," said Bezos in 1999.Jorgensen, for his part, had a nearly identical attitude about Bezos.However, Stone managed to find Jorgensen, now 69, who owns a bike shop in Glendale, Arizona.Here's how Jorgensen reacted when Stone introduced himself: "He had no idea what I was talking about.
Jorgensen said he didn’t know who Jeff Bezos was and was baffled by my suggestion that he was the father of this famous CEO.
Stone jogged Jorgensen's memory, trotting out details about Bezos and his mother.
Says Stone, "The old man’s face flushed with recognition.
Is he still alive?'
he asked, not yet fully comprehending.
Bezos' biological father had disconnected so thoroughly from Bezos life that not only did he not remember his name, and not only did he not realize his son was one of the richest men in the world, but he wasn't even sure if his son was still alive.Jorgensen says that in his younger days "I wasn’t a good father or a husband."
He eventually quit drinking, got his act together and opened his bike shop.
He's married, but had no other children in his life beyond Bezos.A family friend told Stone later that Jorgensen felt overwhelmed with sadness and regret.
He wants to get in touch with Bezos, but it's unclear if that will ever happen.Stone has a book coming out about Amazon.It's excerpted at Bloomberg BusinessWeek.

CEO ofAmazon, is one of the world’s most influential business leaders.
He has revolutionized the retail industry and has become one of thewealthiest individuals in the world.
Though his accomplishments are legendary, there are some interesting facts about his childhood and family that are not as widely known.Bezos was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1964 to a teenage mother,Jacklyn Gise.His biological father,Ted Jorgensen,died in 2015 without having the chance to reunite with his son.
Gise and Jorgensen were married for two years before Gise left with her infant child.In the book “The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and Amazon,” authorBrad Stonedetails his conversation with Jorgensen in 2012, who was initially unaware of his connection to Bezos.“I used to wonder all the time though whatever happened to Jeff.
Then I just reached a point where I thought he was long gone.
That was the only child I ever had – that makes a difference too.
The last time I saw him he was in diapers,” Jorgensenreportedlysaid.Gise went on to marryMiguel Bezos, a Cuban immigrant, who adopted Bezos when he was four years old.Also Read:You Can Become A Landlord In Just 10 Minutes Thanks To This Jeff Bezos-Backed StartupGrowing up, Bezos had a natural curiosity and interest in technology and science, but his family was not wealthy.
He often took apart devices to find out how they worked, and even built a computer from spare parts when he was in high school.Bezos had an entrepreneurial spirit from a young age.
He started a summer camp for kids when he was 12 and ran it for several years.
He also took on a variety of odd jobs, including working as a fry cook, delivering newspapers, and working at McDonald’s.Bezos’s family was also a source of inspiration for him.
His grandfather,Lawrence Preston Gise, was an engineer and a successful entrepreneur.
Bezos often sought his grandfather’s advice and was inspired by his drive and ambition.Bezos has also credited his mother with instilling in him the value of hard work.
Jacklyn Gise worked long hours for most of her life to support her family, and her dedication and commitment to her work had a major influence on Bezos.
He has said that his mother showed him that if you work hard and focus on the long term, you can achieve great things.Now Read:6 Of The Most Inspirational Jeff Bezos Quotes: 'If You Never Want To Be Criticized, For Goodness' Sake Don't Do Anything New'This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Photo: Shutterstock© 2023 Benzinga.com.

Butin 1962, Mike Bezos came to America from Cuba wearing a jacket his mother had hand-stitched from cleaning rags.

Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen was born to 17-year-old high school student Jacklyn Gise on Jan. 12, 1964 in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
Though his biological parents married, Jeff's biological father did not stay in the picture long.

He says his father's parents sent him because under Cuba's then-leader Fidel Castro, "they felt like they had to, to protect him.
My parents were not allowed to go into the airport with me, so they dropped me off," says Mike Bezos in the video, a more complete version of which is available onAmazon.
I got on an airplane and landed in Miami 45 minutes later.
Mike Bezos says he could only bring with him three pairs of pants, three shirts, three pairs of underwear and one pair of shoes.And then there was his coat.
His mom imagined America must be super cold.
So she made him something special for his journey, which we still have," Jeff Bezos says in the video.

I had very little idea at that time where Albuquerque was," Mike says.
That is where he met Gise and her son Jeff.
It is truly unbelievable.
I look back on my life and I had lived the American Dream 30 years ago," Mike Bezos says.
It is really just out of this world.

Happy Sunday!pic.twitter.com/3slx6dHUVa— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos)August 28, 2022Back in 1980, the now-billionaire took the job flipping burgers in the kitchen when he turned 16 years old.
I was a cook," Bezos said in an interview withFast Companyback in 2001.
They were like, 'Hmm, why don't you work in the back?
He went on to explain that the gig taught him that customer service is "really hard" and that the lessons he learned in that job set him up for making customer service a key pillar of Amazon's business model as the company developed.In a book titledGolden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers That Began at McDonald's,Bezos also spoke about the lesson he learned in working under pressure and keeping up team morale.
The most challenging thing was keeping everything going at the right pace during a rush," Bezos told the book's author, Cody Teets.
The manager at my McDonald's was excellent.
He had a lot of teenagers working for him, and he kept us focused even while we had fun.
Bezos resigned as CEO of Amazon on July 5, 2021, marking the 27th anniversary of Amazon as a company.

For example, Bill Gates remembers working 18 hours a day at his first gig as a programmer when he was 16.
His coworkers even tried to convince him to "skip undergraduate and go straight to graduate school."
As we know now, Gates ended up dropping out just two years into college to start Microsoft andgo on to make billions.For some tech execs, the billions came quickly, but for others, notoriety took some time.Here are the first jobs held by some of today's biggest names in tech.Like millions of other Americans, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos got his start flipping burgers at McDonald's.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.zz/Dennis Van Tine/STAR MAX/IPxIt may come as a surprise to know today's richest man in the world, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, earned his first dollar flipping burgers at McDonald's as a teenager in the '80s.
During his first week, Bezos told author Cody Teets, "A five-gallon, wall-mounted ketchup dispenser [...] dumped a prodigious quantity of ketchup into every hard-to-reach kitchen crevice.
Since I was the new guy, they handed me the cleaning solution.
The salary for a fry cook at McDonald's back in 1980 was $2.69.

He first interviewed for a job at Microsoft in 1992.
He remembered the interview as tedious, with one question completely catching him off guard — because it had nothing to do with the line of code he was writing on the whiteboard.The interviewer asked him what he would do if he saw a baby fall.
I thought about it for a while.
This was a computer science question I had not prepped for.
So, I said I'd run to the closest phone booth and call 911," he told Chicago Booth Magazine.

These stories and more in this week’s scouting report on provocative ideas for business.byGretchen GavettbyGretchen GavettTweetPostShareAnnotateSavePrintTweetPostShareAnnotateSavePrintYou'll Never Buy Anything the Same Way AgainThe Secrets of Bezos: How Amazon Became the Everything StoreBusinessweekLeer en españolLer em portuguêsEver wondered what it’s like to work at Amazon?
Or to be one of its competitors or potential acquisitions?
Or even to be related to founder Jeff Bezos?
Look no further than this lengthy piece by Brad Stone, whose book on Bezos and his companycomes out in later this month(natch, that’s an Amazon link).
On my first question, Bezos isn’t a particularly nice boss.
Amazon’s culture is “notoriously confrontational,” with Bezos regularly embarking on what employees call “nutters,” which largely consist of him shooting off phrases like “Are you lazy or incompetent?” “I’m sorry, did I take my stupid pills today?” and “If I hear that idea again, I’m gonna have to kill myself.” And yet many people who work there thrive in this environment and generally find that Bezos is right on target when he flippantly dismisses an idea or prioritizes a customer complaint over being civil to his underlings.And unlike many top companies that offer employees flexible working arrangements and other perks, Amazon gives new employees “a backpack with a power adapter, a laptop dock, and orientation materials,” and reimburses only part of their public-transit passes.
This is a huge jump from the 1990s, however, when “Bezos refused to give employees city bus passes because he didn’t want to give them any reason to rush out of the office to catch the last bus of the day.”As for my second and third questions, you’re going to have to read the article.
In particular, what happens when Stone tracks down Bezos’s biological father is astonishing.Barbarians at the GateMaking the Leap Into Developed MarketsLondon Business SchoolHow will established companies in the U.S., Europe, and Japan respond when companies from emerging markets invade developed economies with “good-enough” substitutes for what the incumbents have been successfully selling in the homeland?
It’s going to happen sooner or later.
Tata Motors, for example, is expected to launch a full-scale attack on American markets with its ultra-cheap cars.
When the assault comes, companies can take a lesson from Gillette, which dealt with a similar threat from Bic’s cheap disposable razors in the 1990s.
By introducing disposable-razor innovations such as lubrication strips, Gillette seized the initiative and essentially redefined the market, writes Costas Markides.
Gillette “managed to convince consumers that they should expect more from their razors and that Bic was not really ‘good enough’ for them.” This kind of nimble response from tough, wily corporations in the developed world will likely limit the invaders’ success in wresting market share from the incumbents, Markides says.—Andy O’ConnellHabitsWhy You Can't Stop Checking Your PhoneBoston GlobeForming habits is one of the ways we become more productive.
Essentially, our brains create shortcuts when it comes to things we do often, like turning off the lights, thereby saving our mental bandwidth for times when we need to make an important decision.
This is all well and good, explains Leon Neyfakh, except when it comes to checking your phone while you drive.With distracted driving, which injured 387,000 people and killed 3,331 more in 2011, the impulse has been to increase public awareness (filmmaker Werner Herzogdirected this 30-minute stunnerof a campaign, for example).
But that approach may not work.
Your phone programs your brain to habitually check it.
And when checking text messages or Twitter becomes a neurological shortcut, we may not even be aware we’re picking up our phones, particularly because the act of driving preoccupies our prefrontal cortex, which controls inhibition.
So how do we make ourselves, and others, safer?
Some suggest social campaigns to make checking phones in certain situations socially taboo.
Or we can fight habit with habit, teaching our brains that there are times when we should turn our phones off.Rashomon in Silicon ValleyAll Is Fair in Love and TwitterNew York Times MagazineHope you like start-up soap operas.
In this downright juicy excerpt from Nick Bilton’s forthcoming bookHatching Twitter, we finally get to the bottom of the social network’s origin story.
And it ain’t what developer and self-proclaimed Twitter inventor Jack Dorsey has peddled all these years (among other things, he supposedly invented Twitter on a playground, or when he was 8 years old, or because he was fascinated with trains and maps).There are far, far too many wonderful details to squeeze in here (like the time Ev Williams told Dorsey, “You can either be a dressmaker or the CEO of Twitter,” but not both, or when Dorsey insisted that employees use Twitter rather than text messages, which resulted in a six-figure monthly bill).
But the most resonant aspect of the piece is that after Dorsey was essentially forced out as CEO, he spun his own origin story, portraying himself as the heart and soul of Twitter in order to maneuver his way back to the top of a company he once struggled to run.
In the end, Bilton reminds us that the creation of Twitter was truly a collaborative effort.
Some people are making a ton of money because of it.
Others, like Noah Glass (heard of him?

But, says Sam Theilman at Adweek, the recession and lingering underemployment have made the millennial generation a very different breed of youth from their counterparts of old.
Collectively, millennials carry an eye-popping $1 trillion in student loans, even though only a quarter of the males among them managed to get a degree.
Just 62% of millennial men have jobs; half of those work less than full time.
And they’re not being paid much for their efforts.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the gap between productivity and real hourly compensation has never been wider, which means they’re doing a lot more work for a lot less money.The upshot: Millennials are poor, which is making them very frugal consumers.
New cars are beyond them, and even cable is too expensive.
More than a third still live with their parents.
Unless the economy starts generating better-paying jobs, they’re unlikely ever to turn into the kind of consumers the Baby Boomers and Gen Xers were at their age.—Andrea OvansBONUS BITSWhen Things Go BadlyWhy It’s So Hard for Companies to Make Digital Transformations(Sloan Management Review)Blackberry, Disruption, and Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda(Learning by Shipping)The U.S. Debt Ceiling Crisis Explained(The Guardian)Gretchen Gavettis an associate editor at the Harvard Business Review.

Now, his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez — the founder of Santa Monica, California-based aerial filming company Black Ops Aviation — says it's one of the most important business lessons she's picked up from him since the pair started dating a few years ago.
Living with Jeff is like having a master class every day.
What he's really taught me a lot about is management," Sanchez, a former television news anchor who made guest appearances on ABC's "The View," recently toldThe Wall Street Journal.There's a reason Bezos thinks managers should always speak last in business meetings, for example.
I hold a lot of meetings, and I would talk first in a meeting, and [Bezos] goes, 'No, no, no.
You're the boss.
You talk last.
You let everyone else talk, so that they don't get swayed by your opinion,'" Sanchez said.Ina 2018 speech, Bezos said reshaping his company's approach to meetings was "probably the smartest thing we ever did" at Amazon.First, Bezos did away with PowerPoint presentations.
Instead, he kicked off each meeting with roughly 30 minutes of silence, so attendees could read a detailed memo covering the planned discussion topics.
Then, employees would offer their own thoughts on the memo before Bezos did to guard against subordinates mimicking his point of view to score points with him.The silent reading period created "the context for what will then be a good discussion," Bezos said.It's also a way to make sure attendees actually read the memo, he added.
Simply sending it via email isn't enough: "Executives will bluff their way through the meeting as if they've read the memo, because we're busy, and so you've got to actually carve out the time for the memo to get read," he said.The memo also helps keep the meeting from veering off topic, Sanchez added — especially if you keep it as short as possible, without losing any key details.
Another thing he taught me is: If you're going to have a meeting, have the person running the meeting write a document about what you're going to discuss and why.
And it can't be more than six pages," Sanchez said.Similarly, Bezos recommends keeping the meetings themselves as short as possible once the reading period is over, Sanchez said: "Keep meetings under an hour, if you can.
Multiple studieshave found that spending too much time in meetings — whether they're hour-plus marathons or back-to-back shorter sprints — can increase your stress levels and distract you from your work.Bezos' meeting method is favored byother tech executives, too.
Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, for example, likes to start meetings with attendees reading notes from a Google Doc for 10 minutes, hetweetedin 2018.
This practice makes time for everyone to get on same page, allows us to work from many locations, and gets to truth/critical thinking faster," Dorsey wrote.Sign up now:Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss:Jeff Bezos giving away most of his $122 billion fortune is 'a big deal'—but leaves many questions unanswered, expert saysJeff Bezos keeps a 16-year-old framed magazine as a 'reminder' that Amazon's most profitable service was once just a 'risky bet'VIDEO10:2110:21How Liquid Death's founder started a $700 million water brandFounder EffectStay in the loopGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inboxSign UpAbout UsLearn more about the world of CNBC Make ItLearn MoreFollow UsCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel©2023CNBC LLC.
