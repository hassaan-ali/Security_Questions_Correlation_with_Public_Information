Ring, $2,900, by David Yurman.CultureIntroducing the Real Will SmithFor decades, he worked tirelessly to make himself the biggest movie star on the planet. Then he hit his “fuck-it 50s” and everything changed. Now, as he prepares a raw new memoir and a pair of films tackling racial themes, Will Smith is ready to speak his truth.ByWesley LoweryPhotography byRenell MedranoSeptember 27, 2021​​It has beena long, miserable day by the time Will Smith makes his way through the Louisiana mud past hundreds of extras. A positive (false, as it turned out) COVID test on set this morning meant a new round of nasal swabs for everyone. And a series of thunderstorms has delayed today’s shoot for hours—a 30-minute pause is mandated each and every time that lightning strikes, and there have already been dozens.Will Smith covers the November 2021 issue of GQ. To get a copy, subscribe to GQ.Shirt, $1,675, by Loro Piana. Necklace, $1,680, by Bulgari.Nothing has been easy about the making ofEmancipation,an Apple TV+ project that tells the story of “Whipped Peter,” the Black man whose tattered back is depicted in one of the most famous photos of an enslaved American. The movie was originally slated to shoot in Georgia, but filming was relocated in response to the state’s attempt to pass new voting restrictions. The current location, deep in the muck about an hour from New Orleans, requires a near daily battle with the terrain. By the time I showed up in mid-July, production was already behind schedule. “We’re at the mercy of Mother Nature,” director Antoine Fuqua told me. “The heat, rainstorms, lightning, mosquitoes, the swamp with alligators.”And then, of course, there is the subject matter. As I watch the filming from a few feet away, Smith stands beneath a massive railway bridge the enslaved men are being forced to construct. Smoke from the nearby campfires sticks to the skyline above, and the camera catches Smith’s character conspiring in whispers with his fellow workers about how they might find freedom, just out of earshot of their Confederate captors.“I’ve always avoided making films about slavery,” Smith had told me about an hour earlier as we sat in a production trailer. “In the early part of my career… I didn’t want to show Black people in that light. I wanted to be a superhero. So I wanted to depict Black excellence alongside my white counterparts. I wanted to play roles that you would give to Tom Cruise. And the first time I considered it wasDjango.But I didn’t want to make a slavery film about vengeance.”Coat, $4,995, and turtleneck, $875, by Dolce & Gabbana. Pants, $995, by Loro Piana.Emancipationis different. It would be a disservice to think of it as a “slavery movie,” Smith explained to me. It’s going to be a David Lean–style epic, he said, with the flavor of an action flick. MoreApocalyptothan12 Years a Slave.The story itself is not (just) about the dehumanizing violence of slavery, it’s also about perseverance. Peter is believed to have escaped the Confederacy in 1863 after a harrowing 10-day journey through the Louisiana bayou, joined Lincoln’s army, and then returned to the South to help free those he’d left behind. It’s a difficult story to tell, an even harder one to tell well, and exactly the type that, at this juncture in his life and career, the 53-year-old Smith is yearning to put out into the world.“This was one that was about love and the power of Black love,” Smith said. “And that was something that I could rock with. We were going to make a story about how Black love makes us invincible.”For decades,Will Smith was driven by the desire to be the biggest movie star on earth—early in his career, he even came up with a formula based on the top 10 box office successes of all time. He achieved that goal so effortlessly, ruling the July Fourth weekend from 1996 (Independence Day) to 2008 (Hancock), that it’s easy to forget how unlikely it was for a rapper turned actor. But over the last 10 years, as Smith has become increasingly focused on evolving as a human being, a gulf has emerged between Will Smith the movie star and Will Smith the man.We’ve gotten glimpses of his efforts to close that gap in moments like last year’sFresh Prince of Bel-Airreunion, when he sat down with the actor Janet Hubert and admitted culpability in her departure from the sitcom. There was also his appearance on his wife Jada Pinkett Smith’sRed Table TalkFacebook show where he opened up about some of the most intimate details of their marriage, which birthed a red-eyed internet meme to rival the Crying Jordan. He’s embraced social media—a young man’s game—with the fervor of the aspiring actor he once was, not the global superstar he is today. And in November, he’ll publish a memoir that reveals new information about his troubled relationship with his father, his adventures in self-actualization during what he calls “the fuck-it 50s,” and the ups and downs of his relationship with Jada.Jacket, $5,490, by Tom Ford.

Ring (on left hand), $2,800, by Fabergé.Before I spoke to Smith, his collaborators and friends kept telling me how great a place he’s in at the moment—that he’s centered, deliberate, and even spiritual. Once we settled in for a conversation, Smith told me that his aim now is “strictly to tell stories that help people figure out how to be happy here.” He continued: “The idea is I spent the first half of my life gathering, gathering, gathering, and now the second half of my life is going to be giving it all away.”That means making movies likeKing Richard,directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green and due in theaters this November, in which Smith portrays Richard Williams, the eccentric, hard-nosed father of Venus and Serena. In the grand Smith tradition, it’s an inspiring story of triumph over adversity that contains an affecting character study. The irascible Williams trained both daughters with balls collected from the tennis clubs he couldn’t get into, and protected them from the grind of tennis and the media in a way that makes him look like a prophet of the current moment in which athletes like Naomi Osaka and Simone Biles prioritize their agency and mental health. Smith plays him as a crotchety, unbending, but fiercely loving parent. “My dad was and still is way before his time,” Serena Williams told me in an email. “You see, when someone is different—when they don’t act or look how a person assumed they would—the first reaction is often fear. They think, How do we break them? My dad anticipated that, but he would not allow himself or his family to be broken.”Smith’s portrayal, Serena added, was so convincing that there were moments she had to remind herself that it wasn’t actually her father on the screen. “Richard Williams is a lot like my father,” Smith explained to me. “So when I first read [the script], I understood what it’s like to want your kids to succeed. I had done it a little bit with my kids. I understood what it was to try to mold a young mind, how it’s different with sons than it is with daughters.”Emancipationis an even bigger swing, the kind of big-budget script that often lingers in preproduction for years, if not decades. Yet when Smith took the film to studios last year, George Floyd had died and the world had changed.Coat, $3,750, by The Row. Shirt, $1,300, by Brioni. Pants, $1,395, by Giorgio Armani. Boots, $490, by Grenson. Ring (on right hand), $6,700, by David Yurman. Rings (on left hand), $2,800 each, by Fabergé.“The entire world was in lockdown, watched what happened to George Floyd, and stood up with one voice and said,We see it. We agree,” Smith said. “That’s never happened before and with that the opportunities are unlike they’ve ever been. I’ve been trying to get movies made for a long time. And the amount of money that Apple is paying to tell the story [ofEmancipation] is unprecedented. And those opportunities are globally present and plentiful.”In a golden era for Black talent in Hollywood, when funding is available for projects that would once have been overlooked, Smith sees no sense in wondering if the apple is poisoned. “I just want to encourage Black Americans to take the acknowledgment and seize upon the present global opportunities,” Smith continued. “I would just like us to argue less about certain things and pay attention to the big ripe fruit.”Naturally, I asked him whichcertain thingswe should be arguing about less, prompting Smith to slow his sentences and consider his words carefully. “This is a pitfall area,” he told me, before diving into one of the more contentious semantic debates in contemporary politics.“So ‘Abolish the police. Defund the police.’ I would love if we would just say ‘Defund the bad police.’ It’s almost like I want, as Black Americans, for us to change our marketing for the new position we’re in. So ‘critical race theory,’ just call it ‘truth theory,’ ” Smith said. “The pendulum is swinging in our direction beautifully. And there’s a certain humility that will most capitalize on the moment for the future of Black Americans, without discounting the difficulty and the pain and the emotion. This is a difficult area to discuss, but I feel like the simplicity of Black Lives Matter was perfect. Anybody who tries to debate Black Lives Matter looks ridiculous. So when I talk about the marketing of our ideas, Black Lives Matter was perfection.”“From a standpoint of getting it done, Black Lives Matter gets it done. ‘Defund the police’ doesn’t get it done, no matter how good the ideas are,” he continued. “I’m not saying we shouldn’t defund the police. I’m saying, just don’t say that, because then people who would help you won’t.”Shirt, $1,675, by Loro Piana. Pants, $4,490, by Bottega Veneta. Shoes, $775, by Jimmy Choo. Watch, $21,200, by Omega. Necklace, $1,680, by Bulgari. Bracelet, $2,200, by John Hardy. Ring, $2,800, by Fabergé.You can’t blameSmith if he’s confident he knows the best way to tell a story: The man is a natural raconteur. Between takes, I watched as he recalled with his assistants the time, while filmingConcussionin Pittsburgh, that they all attempted to make it to an evening showing of Denzel Washington’sThe Equalizer,also directed by Fuqua. The driver of the car, a dreadlocked friend named Scoty with a Trinidadian accent to match, had missed the exit—forcing them to take a 22-minute loop in order to turn around. Then, he missed it again. “What’s the point of going to the movies if you miss the trailers?” Smith yelled out, prompting Scoty to throw their vehicle in reverse and back up on the freeway until they got to the exit. Smith told the story at least three times as additional people joined the circle—each new rendition featuring new details, new animated gestures, and an even more refined take on Scoty’s accent—until his staff and security were all giggling with glee.This November, when his memoir,Will,hits bookshelves, the world will receive the most unvarnished version to date of Smith’s own story. He had wanted to write a book for a few years by the time his team reached out to Mark Manson, author of the mega best seller,The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck,while Smith was filming 2019’sGemini Man.“An hour later, I’m on his private jet,” Manson recalled, adding that the entire experience still seems surreal: “Pieces of my brain were splattered against the wall.”The two spent a few days on the Cayman Islands, getting to know each other and brainstorming. “I’ve spent my whole career hiding my true self from the world,” Manson said Smith told him. “I want this book to show people who I really am.” Later, Smith explained to me that he “just really wanted to totally destroy the clinging to ‘Will Smith,’ trying to separate the image of Will Smith from who I actually am.” By the last day of their trip, Manson presented a rough chapter outline. “Hell yeah, hell yeah!” he said Smith exclaimed, running around the room in excitement. “This is it!”Smith’s story starts in Wynnefield, the middle-class neighborhood in West Philadelphia where his parents moved the family when he was two years old. “For a young Black family in the 1970s, this was as ‘American Dream’ as you could get,” he writes of the tightly clustered brick row houses. In the book, he discusses what he describes as one of the defining experiences of his life: at the age of nine, watching as his father punched his mother in the side of the head. It was not the only violence Smith saw his father inflict while growing up, but this particular incident, he writes, “has defined who I am today.” His brother jumped up, trying to intervene. His sister fled, hiding in her bedroom. Smith remembers freezing, too scared to do anything. Smith never discussed the violence with his father, who championed his son’s career until he died in 2016. “My father tormented me. And he was also one of the greatest men I’ve ever known,” Smith writes, noting that his father was the one who instilled in him his sense of loyalty and perfectionism. “He was one of the greatest blessings of my life, and also one of my greatest sources of pain.”For decades, Smith has seen himself as a coward. His desire to please people, to entertain the crowd, and to make us all laugh, he explains, is rooted, at least in part, in the belief that if he kept everyone—his father, his classmates, his fans—smiling, they wouldn’t lash out with violence at him or the people he loved. If he could keep making his mother proud through his accomplishments, he reasoned, perhaps she would forgive his childhood inaction. “What you have come to understand as ‘Will Smith,’ the alien annihilating M.C., the bigger-than-life movie star, is largely a construction—a carefully crafted and honed character—designed to protect myself,” he writes. Later he says, “Comedy defuses all negativity. It is impossible to be angry, hateful, or violent when you’re doubled over laughing.”Jacket, $2,195, by Giorgio Armani. Sweater, $1,200, by Dior Men.

I just never would’ve been able to say this stuff about my father beating up my mother,” Smith told me. “I never would’ve been able to talk about that while he was alive.”The book-writing process was difficult, in part, because Smith wanted to be cautious about the places where telling his own story intersected with telling the stories of others. When the first draft of the manuscript was finished, he convened the people who were mentioned most prominently, primarily family and longtime friends, in Miami. “I read everybody everything I was saying about them,” Smith told me. “I had to get 25 people to come to Miami and hear what I’m saying, because I know people are going to have to live with it forever.”This meeting was the first time Will had ever spoken with his mother about the times his father hit her. “It was literally the first time we ever discussed [it],” Smith told me. “She had never heard my perception of what happened. So it was really cathartic in a way. It went great. But it was a brutal couple of weeks, man. It was brutal.”The book fills in the details of Smith’s younger years: how he went from making high school raps in his friend DJ Jazzy Jeff’s basement to the duo becoming the first hip-hop artists to win a Grammy; how he blew his money on cars and girlfriends before borrowing a few grand from a local drug dealer to pay for his move to L.A., where he ended up auditioning for the starring role inTheFresh Prince of Bel-Airat a party at Quincy Jones’s house; how he lashed out at his first love after she had an affair; how his first marriage, to Sheree Zampino, ended under the weight of his growing ambition, with divorce papers delivered on Valentine’s Day; and how his jealousy of Tupac Shakur, a close childhood friend of his second wife, Jada, prevented him from ever speaking to the legendary rapper before his death.“I totally opened myself up to a fresh sampling of the fruits of the human experience.”Manson said he told Smith that “one of the conditions for this to work for me was that everything needs to be on the table. We can’t have a P.R. person coming in and saying, ‘No, that chapter needs to go.’ ” Smith was more than game, Manson recalled: “Throughout the process there are certain things that came up, and he was like, ‘Why not, let’s put it in.’ I was worried that a lot of stuff was going to get axed. He actually surprised me. ‘Yeah, that’s a little ugly. Let’s keep it in there.’ ”Most clearly, though, the book provides a detailed accounting of Smith’s deliberate effort to become the biggest movie star in the world. “I wanted to do what Eddie Murphy was doing. I wanted to make people feel how I felt the first time I sawStar Wars,” Smith writes. “I wanted to be Eddie Murphy inStar Wars.” The pursuit began with one of his first roles, in 1993’sSix Degrees of Separation.For a rapper turned actor, it was a bold project—a cerebral play made into a film, based on a true story, in which Smith’s young, gay con artist fools a series of high-society New Yorkers into providing him shelter by convincing them he’s the son of Sidney Poitier.One of those New Yorkers was played by Stockard Channing, whom Smith has admitted to falling in love with as a result of staying in character throughout filming (a technique, he writes, that he won’t use again). “That’s very lovely to hear,” Channing told me with a flattered laugh. “We liked each other and trusted each other. That’s actually quite rare.” She explained that “everything was easy from the first time we met each other…. He didn’t have a lot of the neurotic stuff that most of us have.”What soon followed was one of the most commercially successful runs in the history of cinema: Smith’s eight consecutive films grossing over $100 million each at the domestic box office is a record, according toTheHollywood Reporter.Smith’s nemesis for years was Tom Cruise, “the only person who was sustaining a movie career beyond what I could figure out.” AfterBad BoysandIndependence Dayin 1995 and 1996, respectively, Steven Spielberg called, hoping to cast Smith in an upcoming project about a secret police force that works to conceal the existence of extraterrestrials. Smith was skeptical—he’d already done the cop thing, and the alien thing. But Spielberg persisted, and the resulting project wasMen in Black,a major pillar of the Smith cinematic canon.Those three movies alone made Smith a top box-office draw across the world and an unprecedented type of star: a Black actor whom white and global audiences loved. Then, after a couple of relative flops (Wild Wild WestandTheLegend of Bagger Vance), Smith took his first big swing at serious themes, portraying a decade of growth, turmoil, and protest in the life of Muhammad Ali. “It’s as raw and as great of a performance as any that you can think of,” said director Michael Mann, who still thinks back to a night shoot in Chicago that stretched into the early morning hours. As the two men stood in the snow, surrounded by period cars and storefronts, Smith turned to Mann and asked, earnestly: “Can you believe that people actually pay us to do this?”“He’s got a lot of balls artistically and as a man,” Mann told me, noting how difficult an assignment playing Ali is. “He’s materially, wonderfully successful—and conscious of that—but he asks himself the most serious and profound questions that every single one of us encounters in our lives.”After the hugely popularMen in BlackandBad Boyssequels, Smith branched out into apocalyptic sci-fi withI, Robot,costarring Bridget Moynahan. In the film’s most intimate scene, Moynahan learns for the first time that Smith’s character is part robot by methodically inspecting his arm and chest. “I could never get through the take, after the third rib he would start giggling like a little girl,” she recalled. “That’s his charm.”A few years later, when Moynahan’s relationship with Tom Brady ended—only for her to soon learn that she was pregnant with their child, prompting a tabloid frenzy—Smith reached out to his former costar. “He was the first person to pick up the phone and say come over, let’s talk,” Moynahan told me. “And for somebody like that to make room in his life was impressive.… I’m sure I am not unique. He is that person.”“That’s what my life is for,” Smith explained to me a few days after I spoke with Moynahan. Both of his parents, as well as his grandmother, had been the kind of people who you called in a time of crisis. And so it’s a role he’s eager to play for others. “That was the thing even with Tom [Cruise]. Tom and I became friends in the middle of his public difficulties. That’s when I want to be there. If everything is great, call somebody else. Call me when you need help. I love it. I love being the 2 a.m. emergency phone call.”Jacket, $810, and pants, $810, by Lemaire.

But even though he’d gotten everything he’d set out for—the Grammy and global fame, a beautiful and successful wife, children who are themselves superstars—Smith still wasn’t happy. His movies weren’t reaching the same mountaintops asIndependence DayandMen in Black.And his single-minded pursuit of stardom had left many of his closest relationships battered and bruised.“Throughout the years, I would always call Denzel. He’s a real sage. I was probably 48 or something like that and I called Denzel. He said, ‘Listen. You’ve got to think of it as the funky 40. Everybody’s 40s are funky.’ He said, ‘But just wait till you hit the fuck-it 50s,’ ” Smith told me. “He said, ‘Just bear with your 40s.’ I stopped and I was like, ‘The funky 40s and the fuck-it 50s.’ And that’s exactly what happened. It just became the fuck-it 50s, and I gave myself the freedom to do whatever I wanted to do.” Many of those things are detailed in the book, and others he’s still keeping close to the vest. “Some things are forGQarticles and some things are not,” he told me.“The freedoms that we’ve given one another and the unconditional support, to me, is the highest definition of love.”Will on JadaAnd so Smith set out on a journey to find himself, and find happiness. He rented a house in Utah and sat in solitude for 14 days. He traveled to Peru for more than a dozen ayahuasca rituals, even though he’d never even smoked weed and barely drank. (“This was my first tiny taste of freedom,” Smith writes of his first experience. “In my fifty plus years on this planet, this is the unparalleled greatest feeling I’ve ever had.”) He opened a stand-up show for Dave Chappelle. He began traveling without security for the first time, showing up in foreign countries and working his way through the airport crowds unaccompanied. “I totally opened myself up to what, I think, was a fresh sampling of the fruits of the human experience,” Smith told me.During his first meeting with Michaela Boehm, an intimacy coach he spent years working with, Smith confessed that, if he could have anything in the world, he’d want a harem of girlfriends. “Who?” Boehm demanded, insisting he name specific women he’d want to invite to his harem. Misty Copeland, Smith replied. And Halle Berry too. For the rest of the session, the two of them researched specific women who could round out his aspirational harem. The plan was to then begin contacting the women.“I don’t know where I saw it or some shit as a teenager, but the idea of traveling with 20 women that I loved and took care of and all of that, it seemed like a really great idea,” Smith explained to me with a laugh. “And then, after we played it out a little bit, I was like, ‘That would be horrific. That would be horrific.’ I was like, ‘Can you imagine how miserable?’“What she was doing was essentially cleaning out my mind, letting it know it was okay to be me and be who I was. It was okay to think Halle is fine. It doesn’t make me a bad person that I’m married and I think Halle is beautiful. Whereas in my mind, in my Christian upbringing, even my thoughts were sins. That was really the process that Michaela worked me through to let me realize that my thoughts were not sins and even acting on an impure thought didn’t make me a piece of shit.”Jacket, $495, by Vintage India NYC.

Ring (on right hand), $550, by John Hardy.Smith’s relatively latecareer embrace of social media is another storytelling experiment. He’s become one of the internet’s buzziest celebrities, offering fans and followers a glimpse of him on set, embracing weird memes, and shooting TikToks and video clips specifically engineered to go viral.“That was one of the things I learned with James Avery onFresh Prince.James made it very clear, you are not a famous rapper here,” Smith recalled. “If you want to be successful, you’d better humble yourself to this craft. I never forgot that idea: When you start something new, humble yourself to the craft.”He started studying Liza Koshy, who’d leveraged her success on Vine and YouTube into acting roles, and who advised Smith to stop trying to be so perfect. Social media thrives on the perception of authenticity. It was fine if he flubbed a line or his lighting wasn’t perfect in a TikTok. Smith started shooting some of his videos on his iPhone, as opposed to professional camera equipment. He took cues from Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart, who impressed him with the way they’d share behind-the-scenes moments from their movie shoots—something that would have been unthinkable in the Hollywood that Smith had come up in.“They were doing unheard of stuff, posting pictures from set. You can’t post pictures from set a year before the movie comes out—Oh, shit, yes you can,” Smith recalled thinking. “I just saw how they invited people into the process in a way that I thought you weren’t allowed to do.”Bright, the 2017 film Smith starred in for Netflix, was the first to use his content studio, Westbrook Media, to produce social media from the set. After a career of getting excited about scripts that the public might not see on the big screen for years—I Am Legend,for example, took over 10 years to get made—there was something intoxicating about shooting, editing, and getting a video clip out to the public in just a matter of hours. “It completely changed how I interacted with the world and how I interacted with my creative life. I wanted to create fast and put it out.”Sometimes he runs his ideas for posts by his children. Other times, when he’s traveling, the Westbrook Media team reaches out to local social media influencers to set up Creator Days, in which he meets up with a bunch of them to make content. “To just be able to make things, without an outcome goal that had to do with being the biggest movie star in the world, back to the feeling in [DJ Jazzy] Jeff’s mom’s basement of making music. It was fun. We were experimenting, we were trying things.That’s what’s happened again for me with social media,” Smith told me. “It’s such a powerful way for me to keep in touch with people and, creatively, what the next thing is about to be. The next phase of my life is going to be the most creative and expansive of my entire life and career.”Smith’s foray into social media also comes at a time when he and Jada have become Hollywood’s most transparent and vulnerable couple.Red Table Talk, the Facebook show hosted by Pinkett Smith, is the closest thing the digital age has to the role Oprah Winfrey and Dr. Phil once played on broadcast television—a place for difficult, messy conversations about love, sex, drugs, and everything else, often featuring their daughter, Willow, and Jada’s mother, Adrienne Banfield-Norris. Smith himself has appeared on the show, most notably for a frank discussion with Jada about a period of non-monogamy in their marriage. “The pursuit of truth is the only way to be happy in this lifetime,” Smith told me. “And we sort of came to the agreement that authenticity was the release from the shackles of fame and public scrutiny.” When you tell the truth, the pair reasoned, you never have to fear being found out.Shirt, $690, by Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello.

Rings (from top): $3,900, $3,900, and $2,800, by Fabergé.As we satin a trailer on theEmancipationset, heavy raindrops pattering against the metal roof, Smith had a question for me. I was one of the first people he’d spoken to, or at least one of the only ones who didn’t work for him, who had read the draft of his book manuscript. And so he wanted to know what I thought. I told him the truth: I’d enjoyed it, but I’d wondered about how he had decided which details of his marriage to include and which to leave out.Throughout the draft that I’d read, Smith had dropped in foreshadowing tidbits about marital acrimony. Jada, her husband writes, hadn’t wanted a traditional wedding ceremony but gave in to his pressure: “This would be the first of many compromises Jada would make over the years that painfully negated her own values.” Years later, Smith persuaded her to move into a massive 256-acre compound that she was dead set against purchasing. “Nothing good comes from spending your hard-earned money on a ‘family home’ that your wife doesn’t want,” Smith writes. “You are putting a down payment on discord and for years you will be paying off a mortgage of misery. Or, worse.”The harsh reality for those who love a dreamer is that everything comes second to the dream. As Smith’s stardom grew, his wife would wake up many mornings in tears. At one point, she turned down an opportunity for her band to open for Guns N’ Roses so that Smith could continue shootingThe Pursuit of Happyness.Things reached a breaking point by Jada’s 40th birthday, in 2011. Will had spent three years planning a private family-and-friends dinner in Santa Fe, where he screened a documentary he’d commissioned that chronicled her life and traced her family’s lineage back to slavery (and in which he tracked down a descendant of the white family who once owned Jada’s ancestors.)When they got back to the hotel suite that night, Jada was nearly silent. “That was the mostdisgustingdisplay of ego I have ever seen in my life,” Smith recalls his wife telling him. The two began fighting so loudly that a 10-year-old Willow, with whom they were sharing the suite, emerged crying with her hands over her ears, begging them to stop. “Our marriage wasn’t working,” Smith writes. “We could no longer pretend. We were both miserable and clearly something had to change.”And then, a little abruptly, the book’s narrative about Will and Jada ends. In the early version of the manuscript that I read, there was no discussion of any outside relationships, on his behalf or hers. When I mentioned this to Smith, he asked me: “You felt cheated?” Now, look, I’m a reporter. I certainly read that manuscript ready to jot down any and every detail about who and what Will and Jada may have been doing during the more open parts of their past decade. But the reality is, a fair amount of what’s missing played out in public. At some point, their relationship stopped being monogamous.“Jada never believed in conventional marriage.… Jada had family members that had an unconventional relationship. So she grew up in a way that was very different than how I grew up. There were significant endless discussions about, what is relational perfection? What is the perfect way to interact as a couple? And for the large part of our relationship, monogamy was what we chose, not thinking of monogamy as the only relational perfection,” Smith told me. “We have given each other trust and freedom, with the belief that everybody has to find their own way. And marriage for us can’t be a prison. And I don’t suggest our road for anybody. I don’t suggest this road for anybody. But the experiences that the freedoms that we’ve given one another and the unconditional support, to me, is the highest definition of love.”Smith grappled with whether to include all of that stuff in the book, and it was clear that the final version could look different than the one I saw. But ultimately he decided to leave many of the most personal details out. There was no way to chronicle the parts that happened next from solely his own perspective. There was no way to tell his story without telling others’ too. “It felt like it was a whole book unto itself,” Smith explained.In July 2020, following public revelations of what Jada would describe as an “entanglement” with the R&B singer August Alsina, a tabloid frenzy ensued and Will and Jada took themselves to the Red Table for a 12-minute discussion of the dynamics of their relationship. This did not necessarily clear things up. “The public has a narrative that is impenetrable,” Smith said. “Once the public decides something, it’s difficult to impossible to dislodge the pictures and ideas and perceptions.” Because the impetus for theRed Table Talkwas Alsina’s disclosures, a viewer could have walked away thinking that Jada was the only one engaging in other sexual relationships, when that was not, Smith delicately explained to me, in fact the case. Or take one of the memes spawned by their discussion, a screenshot of Smith looking stern-faced and droopy-eyed. “It was midnight and we were going on vacation the next day,” Smith explained, noting that the details they were discussing were, by that point, years in the past. “It was like, no, no, no, guys, I’m not sad. I’m fucking exhausted.”It was clear that Smith had more to say. I could feel him rubbing up against the guardrails that he and Jada had established about what they would discuss publicly. He told me he’d talk with Jada, but when we spoke again a few weeks later, he said he wasn’t sure he wanted to go much deeper.I was supposed to be disappointed. But, after reading about the work he’s done to break his addiction to affirmation, to free himself of the need to please, it was hard not to be proud of him for sticking to a boundary. “It may seem hard to believe, but I would lose sleep over not giving you the answer that I know you could use,” Smith told me. “I want to help you, I want you to succeed, I want you to have a headline. But by the same token, I don’t want to deal with the backlash of that in the world. To say I don’t want to talk about that three years ago would have been fucking excruciating for me.”For decades, Will Smith has been gracious to every interviewer. He gives you 90 minutes after agreeing to an hour. And then when he’s done, he walks outside to take photos with every fan, smiling for each and every one.But Will? The real Will, not the character he’s been playing for our benefit? He gets to say no to the 100th selfie of the day. He gets to keep some things private, even when he knows your story would be better with just a few more details.“The major difference is I tell the truth, even when people don’t like it,” Smith told me. “And Will Smith doesn’t.”Wesley Loweryis a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist.A version of this story originally appeared in the November 2021 issue with the title "Unvarnished."Subscribe to GQ.Click here >>PRODUCTION CREDITS:Photographs byRenell MedranoStyled byMobolaji DawoduHair byPierce Austinfor iTalent CompanySkin byJudy Murdockfor iTalent CompanyTailoring byMarie StaggandMary HillenSet design byChere TheriotProduced by138 ProductionsLocation: Race + Religious, New Orleans, LARelated Stories for GQWill SmithGQ Cover StoryProfilesBest of GQMoviesEntertainmentRead MoreCultureHow Tyshawn Jones and William Strobeck Changed Skateboarding ForeverByFarran GoldingCultureKeenan Coogler onCreed III’sAnime Influences, Moving on From Rocky, and Writing Jonathan Majors as a VillainByFrazier TharpeCultureEverybody Was Pulling for Brendan FraserByZach BaronCultureChris Chalk, the Conflicted Heart ofPerry Mason, on Stealing Scenes and Playing a CopByAngel DiazGQ COUPONSWayfair CouponWayfair's Spring Clearance Sale: Up to 70% offBed Bath And Beyond CouponApply Bed Bath and Beyond coupon and save 25% off your entire purchaseTarget Promo Code25% off sitewideMichaels coupon20% Off collapsible laundry basket with Michaels couponAsos Promo CodeNew Customers enjoy 15% Off on purchases over $50 with Asos Promo CodeMichael Kors Promo CodeMichael Kors promo code: sign up for KORSVIP + Get 10% off on First OrderSince 1957, GQ has inspired men to look sharper and live smarter with its unparalleled coverage of style, culture, and beyond.

We are pursuing the kind of love that everybody dreams about," Smith said. "We just know that the road [doesn't] look like everybody think[s] it's supposed to look."Gregg Deguire/FilmMagic via Getty Images, FILEIn this Oct. 6, 2019, file photo, Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith arrive at a premiere in Hollywood, Calif.In his new memoir, "Will," the actor, 53, delves into the most personal details of his life, from his relationship with Pinkett Smith to his at times "traumatic" childhood in Philadelphia. Smith said that his father, who died in 2016, was abusive toward his mother, and that dynamic affected him for years. Smith tried to bury those painful memories, and he never discussed them with his mother until he decided to write his book."I always had this sense of being a coward because I watched my father beat up my mother and I didn't do anything. And for a 9-year-old, it's hard to break that programming, but I've done a lot of work," he said. "I would say that I've almost completely purged and purified that negative perception of myself. I feel good about my life."Editor's Picks1Will Smith reveals he considered suicide in trailer for his new documentaryNovember 1, 20212Will Smith discusses his marriage with Jada Pinkett Smith, says it 'can't be a prison'September 28, 20213Will Smith surprises newcomer Jabari Banks with news that he landed lead role in 'Fresh Prince' rebootSeptember 1, 2021That includes his career. In his upcoming film, "King Richard," Smith plays Richard Williams, the father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams. His performance is already earning Oscar buzz, but for Smith, a father of three, the real satisfaction has come from the opportunity to play such a complicated and dynamic person. Williams, Smith said, "has been so vilified" for the way he parented his daughters, but upon delving more deeply into his story, the actor found himself thinking, "He was doing something right." When the opportunity to embody him in the biopic presented itself, Smith jumped at the chance."He was a lion that was protecting his kids and he didn't care what you thought. He would eat you alive if you tried to hurt his kids," Smith said. "I was very excited to portray that kind of fatherhood on screen."After all, for the actor, the truth matters. It's why he's tried to be open about the hurt he's experienced in his life, and it's at the root of how he intends to conduct himself in the future. Explaining that "the first of my life was gathering," he added, "I look at the second half of my life as giving it all back in the form of wisdom, in the form of honesty, in the form of authenticity for the purpose of being helpful.""You can't be happy if you're hiding. You can't truly be happy if you don't feel comfortable to be you," he said. "I'm finding any emotional invincibility."Sign up for our newsletters to get GMA delivered to your inbox every morning!Up Next incultureAriana Grande addresses comments about her body: ‘There are many kinds of beautiful’April 12, 2023Singer Granger Smith says he's pursuing ministry and that this summer will be his last tourApril 12, 2023Animal shelter names adoptable dogs after Taylor Swift songs ahead of her concertApril 11, 2023ContestsTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My InfoChildren’s Online Privacy PolicyAdvertise with usYour US State Privacy RightsInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementPressFeedbackABC NewsABCAll VideosAll TopicsSitemapCopyright ©2023ABC News Internet Ventures.

An ultimately heartwarming read, Will provides a humane glimpse of the man behind the actor, producer and musician, as he bares all his insecurities and trauma.” —USA TodayWinner of the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary AchievementOne of the most dynamic and globally recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully about his life, in a brave and inspiring book that traces his learning curve to a place where outer success, inner happiness, and human connection are aligned. Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had.Will Smith’s transformation from a West Philadelphia kid to one of the biggest rap stars of his era, and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, is an epic tale—but it’s only half the story.Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over.This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one person mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts Will the book, like its author, in a category by itself.GenresNonfictionAudiobookBiographyMemoirAutobiographyBiography MemoirMusic...more418 pages, HardcoverFirst published November 9, 2021Book details & editionsLoading interface...Loading interface...About the authorWill Smith57books644followersLibrarian Note: There is more than one author by this name in the Goodreads database.Will Smith is an actor, producer and musician, two-time Academy Award nominee, Grammy Award and NAACP award winner who has enjoyed a diverse career encompassing films, television and multi-platinum records.Starting as a rapper in 1985, Smith is best known for his acting roles in “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air”, I AM LEGEND, the BAD BOYS and MEN IN BLACK film series, HITCH and most recently, ALADDIN. His vast filmography also includes transformative portrayals of true-life icons in ALI and THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS, both which garnered him Academy Award nominations, as well as his role in CONCUSSION. Smith recently produced and starred in 2020’s biggest box office hit, BAD BOYS FOR LIFE, in addition to producing and appearing in HBO Max’s emotional and most watched, “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” 30th Anniversary Reunion special.Next up, Smith will produce and star as Richard Williams, infamous father of American icons Venus and Serena Williams, in Warner Brothers’ KING RICHARD, which will release on November 19th. This summer, Smith begins production on Apple’s upcoming scripted action thriller EMANCIPATION, directed by Antoine Fuqua, and produced by his Westbrook Studios.In 2019, Smith launched his media company, Westbrook Inc. alongside Jada Pinkett Smith, Miguel Melendez and Kosaku Yada, which focuses on empowering artists to tell stories that connect with a global audience. Westbrook houses Westbrook Studios, Westbrook Media, the digital content studio, social media management, and creative brand incubator, and direct to consumer business, Good Goods.

Essentially I don’t mind if he’s in a movie I’m watching, but I probably didn’t start watching it just because he’s in it. I love great audiobooks though, so snagging this on my library app was a no-brainer after seeing its very high ratings.I did get jiggy wit all the music interspersed throughout the stories, and I loved hearing about his childhood in Philadelphia and the early days of his success with Jazzy Jeff in the exploding hip hop scene. Even the origin story of “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” fascinated me. But once he became THE BIGGEST MOVIE STAR OF ALL TIME, he lost me.Isn’t that weird? Typically when you read a Hollywood tome you’re in it for the juicy celebrity bits and have to wade through the blah blah blah rags to get to the rah rah rah riches. The issue here is that Smith’s ego so overtakes the narrative that it’s hard to see him as the sympathetic character he wants to be. Readers/listeners are repeatedly told how awesome he his, including during a game of Monopoly with his wife and kids that he breaks down play-by-painful-play. The result is that my neutrality on the guy tipped toward the negative. It’s not often I end up liking a subject less at the end of an autobiography, and I certainly didn’t expect that to happen here.I do keep referring to this as an autobiography rather than a memoir, because it’s a pretty exhaustive look at his entire life. Though maybe it’s a biography, since he has a credited co-author, Mark Manson. I didn’t love Manson’s The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F#ck, so perhaps that’s part of it.I don’t regret listening to Will, but I sure was glad when it was over.Now I’ll take Mother’s sage advice and stop talking.Blog:https://www.confettibookshelf.com/478 likes68 commentsLikeCommentMonica **can't read fast enough**1,030 reviews332 followersApril 2, 2022I was able to binge listen to the Will Smith memoir and I enjoyed every minute! I pre-ordered the physical book but I also got access to the audio book from Penguin Random House Audio and I am so glad! If you can, I HIGHLY recommend listening to this one. Will narrating it himself makes it wonderful but the addition of music and other audio clips makes this one of the most entertaining audio books that I have experienced. Will reading his own story plays directly into his strengths as a storyteller and entertainer that added emotion and impact to his anecdotes. Is Will Smith a bit self aggrandizing and sometimes comes off a bit boastful? Yes, but witnessing a Black man recognizing and being proud of the amazing things that he has been able to do just does not bother me at all. Smith is self assured and a little boastful in that he knows that many of the things he accomplished were groundbreaking, but he always acknowledges that he in no way got to where is alone or even solely on his own merits. His personal growth and challenges have been interesting to hear from his perspective. I'll have a bit of an audio book hangover now that it's done. I will at some point either listen to it again or read the physical book because there are several things that I wanted to tab and didn't.***I received an ALC from the publisher.***Where you can find me:•(♥).•*Monica Is Reading*•.(♥)•Twitter:@monicaisreadingInstagram:@readermonicaaudio-booksautobiography-biography-memoirmy-favorites...more349 likes32 commentsLikeCommentSwrp609 reviewsMay 27, 2022[Circle Of Life, "The Lion King" (c) Walt Disney Pictures.)"YOUandNOWare a unique occurrence, of which you are the most reliable measure of all the possibilities."***> Memoir is a literary genre, and it is a recollection and narration of the writer`s personal life and memories.

A memoir will always be about self. Even if the book is written by an austere and selfless monk from the Himalayas, the contents will still be about self, and thus they would sound to be selfish, self-centred and egotistical. So, what should we call a person who after reading a memoir likeWillcalls the writer a boastful person, a bragger and an as*h**e!?> A memoir is not a self-help book.***“I was raised to believe that I am inherently equipped to handle any problems that may arise in my life, racism included.”And it dawned on me, If I don’t want to be with me, why the f**k would anybody else wanna be with me?Overall,Willis an honest and engaging memoir. So real and raw. And then, the memoir is a wee bit of everything - inspiring, frustrating, uplifting, heartbreaking, fun, heartwarming, eye-opening, interesting, entertaining, hopeful, emotional, and much much more! There is something everyone can get out of this book.It would have been more fun to have an understanding and liking of rap music, as much of the content in this part of Smith`s life was just going over the head - no understanding of hip-hop or the artists! However, the writing is very engaging, so being a fan of rap music is not a prerequisite to reading this book.It was heartening to see Will Smith mentioning books as being of big help and guidance in his life. He mentions reading a ton of books, including the following:-Paulo Coelho`sThe Alchemist;-Joseph Campbell`sThe Hero with a Thousand Faces;-Pema Chödrön’sWhen Things Fall Apart.;-The Autobiography of Malcolm X;-Bhagavad Gītā As It Is;-The Road Less Traveled;-Don Quixote;-The Untethered Soul;-Teachings of the Buddha;-The Odyssey;-Moby-Dick;-How to Win Friends and Influence People;-The 5 Love Languages;-As a Man Thinketh;-Oneness;-Zen in the Art of Archery;-Plato’sRepublic;-The Way of the Superior Man;-Iron John;-Aspire;-I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings;-The Power Path;-Man’s Search for Meaning;-Chödrön’sHow to Meditate: A Practical Guide to Making Friends with Your Mind.Books on death:-On Death and Dyingby Elisabeth Kübler-Ross;-The Tibetan Book of Living and Dyingby Tibetan Buddhist teacher Sogyal Rinpoche;-Tuesdays with Morrieby Mitch Albom;-The Year of Magical Thinkingby Joan Didion.*From the notes:“There is no wall. There are only bricks. Your job is to lay this brick perfectly. Then move on to the next brick. Then lay that brick perfectly. Then the next one. Don’t be worrying about no wall. Your only concern is one brick.”==========“Because if two people are in charge, everybody dies! So, if you`re in charge, let me know because I will defer to your leadership!”==========Internal power and confidence are born of insight and proficiency. When you understand something, or you’re good at something, you feel strong, and it makes you feel like you have something to offer.==========Hope sustains life. Hope is the elixir of survival during our darkest times.==========“Jus’ remember, Lover Boy,” she said, “be nice to everybody you pass on your way up, coz you just might have to pass them again on your way down.”==========Living is the journey from not knowing to knowing. From not understanding to understanding. From confusion to clarity.==========By universal design you are born into a perplexing situation, bewildered, and you have one job as a human: figure this shit out.==========The whole point of venturing into uncertainty is to bring light to the darkness of our ignorance.==========Life is like school, with one key difference—in school you get the lesson, and then you take the test. But in life, you get the test, and it’s your job to take the lesson.==========The universe only teaches through experience.==========It’s better to die than to walk around scared.==========Heartbreak should be considered a disease—it induces a debilitating state akin to mental illness.==========Nothing and no one is immune to the entropy of the universe.==========It’s respectable to lose to the universe. It’s a tragedy to lose to yourself.==========The universe is not logical, it’s magical.==========The capacity to adjust and improvise is arguably the single most critical human ability.==========It’s amazing how skewed your vision can become when you see the present through the lens of your past.==========What someone desires is a portal into the essential truth of their personality. If you want to understand why someone did something, you need only answer the question, What did he want?==========When you know what you want, it clarifies what you don’t want. And even painful decisions, though not easy, become simple.==========The problem is, all of your dreams are on the other side of pain and difficulty.==========But the heart and soul of our union was then, and is still today, intense, luminescent conversation.==========Purpose and desire can seem similar, but they are very different, sometimes even opposing forces.==========As Viktor Frankl wrote, “In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.”==========There is an energy that’s at work while you’re asleep—the energy that fires the sun, that moves the ocean, that beats your heart.==========Act when the universe is open, and rest when she’s closed.==========To love and to be loved is the highest human reward and ecstasy.==========Allowing the best within you to serve and unleash the best within others is the most intense of human pleasures.==========I’ve realized that for some reason, God placed the most beautiful things in life on the other side of our worst terrors.==========It really is true that your whole life flashes before your eyes when you think you’re going to die.==========Loving, giving, helping, serving, protecting, nourishing, empowering, and forgiving arethe secrets of “the Smile.”In the end, it will not matter one single bit how well they loved you—you will only gain “the Smile” based on how well you loved them.==========Not very sure why, but this memoir kept reminding me ofCircle of Life:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GibiN...🎶🎵From the day we arrive on the planetAnd, blinking, step into the sunThere's more to see than can ever be seenMore to do than can ever be doneThere's far too much to take in hereMore to find than can ever be foundBut the sun rolling highThrough the sapphire skyKeeps great and small on the endless roundIt's the circle of lifeAnd it moves us allThrough despair and hopeThrough faith and love'Til we find our placeOn the path unwindingIn the circleThe circle of life.🎶🎵205 likes28 commentsLikeCommentFraser SimonsAuthor9 books243 followersNovember 23, 2021It’s Will. He delivers a good performance. What he is narrating is a very specific story that is geared toward a self-help rhetoric; unfortunately a fairly redundant one. You cannot make yourself happy by making money, you have to nurture yourself. So, the real reason to consume this is for the performance and the entertainment value while navigating to that point.He goes into his fear of being a coward, but doesn’t really link it to gender roles or anything much beyond the fact that his dad was just like that. He tells you that his father was physically abusive and at one point, even while getting side tracked running to get some smokes, his dad told him that every single thing he does a mission. You either succeed, or you’re dead. Yes, his dad was in the army. And yes, Will’s success coming from a trauma response makes a heck of a lot of sense. Though, we also learn other key people literally in one room mostly was the reason he made it, an orchestration of Quincy Jones.And then… with these things established, he simply launches into his career and highlights and his macro level trajectory to massive success. The vulnerability never really comes back. And I’m not very convinced it was ever really present.To be honest, this book is calculating. There is a performative vulnerability at key sections fostering trust between the reader and Will. And, to be clear, that’s a fine way to construct this kind of a story. But, he often displays a lack of critical self awareness and skates over accountability in favour of easy contrition. I promise you that if you take all the possessions of your partner, pour lighter fluid on them, and then light them all when she arrives home to witness this act, you are not a well person. And frankly, saying she didn’t deserve that and moving on, and you were both young yada yada, is one thing. But he tries to isolate that event. Except… between the lines or in passing—presumably he thinks some of these things aren’t a big deal?—there is even more concerning behaviour. All of which mostly just made me think that he was a person that confronted his trauma far too late for those around him.Ultimately, he navigates to an almost comical ending for me. He ends up going on the spiritual awakening journey and doing pseudo-mystical, drug induced trips, hires a life coach therapist because he doesn’t know who he is (as if that’s a singular experience at mid life). He also comes to the realization that memory isn’t a video, but a personal rendering that is not accurate. Or that, and I am not kidding here, other peoples’ feelings actually matter and should be considered. If you’re 20 maybe some of these epiphanies will be profound to you, but his own journey ultimately conforms to an archetypical journey, which only adds to the sterility and artificial aspects within the structure of the book. That’s why it was comical to me. Don’t get me wrong: I’m glad he’s doing some work on himself and is in a good place now, at 50 years old, but make no mistake, this is, and feels like, a performance that is most likely simply another tick off the bucket list—rather than a wholehearted reckoning and self-examination of an individual.black-culturememoirnonfiction163 likes11 commentsLikeCommentElyse Walters3,941 reviews35.5k followersDecember 14, 2021Will Smith portrayed ‘himself’ as a funny - animated - immodest - all-consuming ‘Will-Wonderful’, guy.His stories were at times fascinating:…..A basketball figure-skater-little nine-year-old Will image cracked me up!! 🏀⛸…..……stories about his father, mother, brother, kids on the playground— ‘growing years’ were ‘each’ fascinating: real, brutal, thought-provoking….and ‘understanding’.His self-preservation strategies were heartrending.…….Will’s cowboy boot wearing phase as a kid was endearing.👢……Learning about the depths of Will’s imagination [silliness encouraged by his mama combined with his mothers emphasis on Will’s seriousness for education] - was impelling…..But….my goodness Will’s overly *me, me, me*…..*Will, Will, Will* ….was ‘on-the-edge’….hair-raising….straight-shooting….swaggering-egotistical-down right cocky-boastful…self-admiring…self-importance - semi-flaunting …..exhausting at times too.The intensity of Will’s ‘narrative-persuasive voice’ was two-fold/and two-fold:…..”annoying & lovable ….And…..lovable & annoying”.Will’s exaggerated tone was - at times - excessive and overpowering….….especially his ‘coup de grace’ resistance to play Muhamed Ali……hyperbolized ….embellished monumental elaborate grandiloquence declaration.Note: Will Smith gave an unforgettable performance—his portrayal of the boxer Muhammad Ali received widespread commercial success.Will Smith has been called the most powerful actor in Hollywood more than once…Clearly Will Smith is a dedicated actor in comedy, and drama.

I just didn’t expect to be so blown away by his story, parts of which resonated deeply with me, despite having different lives.I listened to the audiobook ofWill, which Will narrates. He does a great job and is a true performer, bringing different voices and music clips at fitting moments. You can hear his authentic emotion throughout the book. There are lots of funny moments but also many heartfelt and serious ones.I learned a lot I didn’t know too — Jada grew up in Baltimore and was close friends with Tupac. Will is a big reader and lovedThe Alchemist, which is still my personal, forever favorite book!While most of our lives are much different than Will’s, there’s a takeaway for everyone in his story. An excellent surprise of a book.119 likes18 commentsLikeCommentMediaman918 reviews44 followersNovember 18, 2021Biggest ego in Hollywood turns in a surprisingly inept memoir that is filled with his verbal vomit (he admits that from childhood he can't shut up). There are a few good stories, but for the most part it is him bragging non-stop about his fame and riches. It's almost shocking how many dozens or hundreds of times he repeats how famous he is. He should be embarrassed.Some fans are going to praise him for spilling his guts on his internal struggles of self-acceptance, his sex life with his wife Jada (who comes across as crazy in this book) or his dealing with an abusive father (who he really slams though Will owes his entire career to his dad allowing him to skip college). But Smith avoids a number of major subjects as well as giving almost no details about how is movies were made. While he's rambling on about growing up in Philly (not that exciting) or being a father to kids that are rather odd, he manages to prove that he still has a big wall up about who he really is.This guy must be the most insecure human on the planet based on how often he strokes his ego. Some may call it a "humble brag" but this has more self-praising statements than any memoir I've ever read (and I've read over 750). Probably more than all the others I've read together. The fake humility that he tries to use to make us feel sorry for him come across as another acting job.It's also offensive to see his regular use of the N-word. Totally inappropriate in this era and leads to the question--why is he allowed to get away with it? If it's simply because of his color then he's being racist to go along with some of his sexist comments. He doesn't say much about the women he must have bedded but he seems to subtly demean the women he committed himself to.It needed a strong co-writer and good editor to channel all the hyper tangents Smith goes off on. A third (or more) is wasted energy. The book even has factual errors in it, funny for a guy who claims to be a perfectionist. Add the quasi-spiritual turn he makes near the end (where again he brags) and the whole thing becomes an eye-rolling mess. He goes to South America for a regular routine of mind-altering substances, yet with a straight face says he doesn't do drugs. There nothing to admire about the guy in this autobiography other than his audacity to think he's so great--if he read his own book he'd discover how truly imperfect he is.autobiographyhollywoodmemoir...more110 likes28 commentsLikeCommentNima Morgan228 reviews40 followersDecember 9, 2021So, I am confused ...is he the "biggest", most famous, richest movie star in the US or the World or the universe?Found this book to be interesting and yet exhausting...just wonder if it would have been slightly more enjoyable if he stopped mentioning how wonderful and famous he is.105 likes12 commentsLikeCommentArtemy1,041 reviews946 followersReadOctober 7, 2021I have been working on a translation of this book for the past two months, so I really don't feel like I can give it a fair rating one way or another. I will say it's an impressively written and constructed memoir, even if you're not too interested in Will Smith as a person. He covers topics like the early years of hip-hop, DJ-ing and MC-ing, music production, TV, Hollywood movies and the inner workings thereof — Will Smith had his hand in all of those and his perspective on most things is unique and often quite fascinating. He also delves deep into psychology and psyche, philosophy, his childhood and upbringing in West Philadelphia, and his relationships with parents, family and friends, including many other famous ones. Will Smith fans should definitely check it out, but even if you aren't one of them, the man lived a fascinating life and he tells his story well. Plus, if you're at all interested in any of the topics I mentioned, you'll find heaps of cool insider information here.

There are some fun stories in this book, and I suspect big Will Smith fans may be highly entertained by his stories…However I felt this book lacked depth and honesty. I don’t believe the author himself has done enough self reflective work. It seems he has perhaps begun some self work towards the end of this book - this actor certainly knows how to say the right things- but I felt that he has yet to apply that knowledge to examine his life. Perhaps this memoir would have been better written in 10 or 20 years from now after the self work kicked in.I do admire his passion and hard work, but that could have and should have been summarized in 100 pages. Despite it being technically well written - thank you Mark Mason- I was truly bored at times due to lack of insight as well as an abundance of superfluous information. For example, he lists off the exact number of soundtrack or movie sales, calls himself the biggest (movie/rap) star in the world repeatedly, then claims it is not about him and he’s not flexing. Lmao. His arrogance, lack of self-awareness/self-education is a terrible combination for a memoir. He read his first book in his 20s; it is not at all surprising that The Alchemist is one of his favorite books.The way he treats women irks me, but one may not notice the gravity unless one is good at noticing what he is NOT saying. All his love interests overlap, he always has a back up ready to go before his last relationship ends, yet claims utter devotion to most of these women. How are you so devoted yet keeping a backup? He just seems controlling while imposing a double standard. For example, he mentions going out of his way for Jada’s bday to ‘fix’ their problems, but there no real dialogue on what is actually wrong (aside from implying it’s her fault as she is not a happy person on her own). How clueless to think bday events can fix marital issues. Her reaction about his display of ego was spot on! Sometimes, his only self reflection after doing something insane (such as setting someone’s possessions on fire) is simply “I regret that, she didn’t deserve to be treated that way”. That’s it Willard?! Perhaps a little dramatic, but I regret reading this book as I will never be able to fully enjoy one of his movies or shows the same way again.The extra star is for Mark Mason’s writing and Will’s performance as an actor.bios-autobios-mémoiresblack-authors73 likes26 commentsLikeCommentOlive Fellows (abookolive)569 reviews4,623 followersNovember 13, 2021Click hereto hear my thoughts on this book over on my Booktube channel, abookolive.Willis the memoir/autobiography (or something in between) of actor, musician, and all-around global superstar Will Smith. It’s highly focused on the lessons he learned from all the periods of his life he discusses, zooming in on particular times in his life and leaning away from certain touchy subjects (like scientology and his separation). The book is full of Smith’s effervescence and co-writer Mark Manson (author ofThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life) helped to make this a fun, rewarding read. It’s the perfect book for Will Smith fans (like myself), especially leading into New Year’s Resolution season!memoirpop-culture72 likesLikeCommentLiong124 reviews72 followersFebruary 21, 2022I am really enjoying this book very much.

I’ve always been indifferent, liking Fresh Prince, but not many of his films. I’m just gonna say it: This is one of the worst celebrity memoirs I’ve ever read. It’s an incessant boasting of fame and riches. He uttered some iteration of his being “the biggest movie star in the world” so often, I wish I’d kept count. Humble, he is not. Very little of this felt sincere. Massively disappointing.memoir-biographynonfiction59 likes4 commentsLikeCommentMehrsa2,234 reviews3,659 followersApril 9, 2022I read this book before “the slap” and I have to say that it was sort of shocking to see will smith act the way he did after reading this book. He ended the saga talking about the Jada birthday bash in which she got mad at him and then his journey of self-exploration. He did ayahuasca like 16 times and it was actually quite moving to hear about his experiences with self-discovery. But I guess it’s a journey and I’d sort of like another chapter epilogue to have him talk through what happened. What the book makes clear is that WS is a man who’s lived with a lot of familial, personal, and cultural expectations. He’s achieved success based on his pure grit and will (get it?) power. His relationship with his father was abusive and though he recognizes it, it still affected his relationships. I appreciate that the book delves into all of this stuff in a pretty honest way.55 likesLikeCommentMeags2,090 reviews364 followersDecember 6, 20215 StarsNot to get all fangirl-y on everyone, but this was by and large the best celebrity memoir I’ve EVER had the pleasure of reading.Honest and unwavering, Will Smith—rapper, actor, son, husband, father, global-God-damn-superstar—leaves no stone unturned in his telling of his extraordinary life’s journey.That boisterous, larger-than-life persona the world knows and loves, is deliberately unmasked within, as Will shares stories both fortuitously joyful and ambitiously unyielding, but always brutally honest and deeply personal.He doesn’t always paint himself in the best light, but God damn was I impressed and humbled by his raw honesty throughout.What made this a truly unique and ground-breaking celebrity memoir experience is how Will managed to combine so many themes and tones into one smooth flowing and non-stop entertaining read. He shares ALL the anecdotes of his Hollywood and music industry fame that fans will be eager for, but he also goes deeper, recounting many profound (sometimes shocking) stories of his childhood, family life (across four generations), with tales of love and loss, and an ambitious streak that just won’t quit.Some stories made me laugh and some made me cry, but what I loved most is how, after an experience was shared, particularly if it was an emotional or traumatic experience, Will would then go on to analyse the moment and his behaviour in said moment, turning even the worst experiences of his life into self-teachable moments. In that way, this could even be classified as a damn enjoyable personal-development book.It became exceedingly clear early on, that this is a man who has been through a lot and has worked his ass off to grow and learn and generally BE BETTER, for his family, his fans, and especially for himself. I admire that.And most importantly, Will spends a great deal of the book acknowledging and praising every single person in his life that has helped shape him and support him, as well as those who have challenged him and been unafraid to tell him brutal truths at times, even when he wasn’t ready to hear them (but NEEDED to hear them). No man is an island, and that couldn’t be more clear here.I’ve been a lifetime fan of Will Smith, but I’d like to imagine that my positive bias has nothing to do with the actual quality of this memoir. Had I not been a fan before, I would be now.Side note: Jada was right—it wasn’t funny. (Readers will understand).*****************************************Audio Edition:I personally switched between bouts of reading and listening to Will’s self-narration, and I cannot stress enough how wonderful the audiobook is. It was AN EXPERIENCE. Hearing Will tell his own story can't be matched by simply reading the words yourself. And as an added temptation, the sound and music production of the audiobook was off the charts, with Will regularly rapping/singing within. 🙌🙌🙌audiobookauthors-of-colorbios-and-memoirs...more50 likes19 commentsLikeCommentJeremy720 reviews43 followersDecember 18, 2021"Will" is intended by the author to be a memoir/self help book, but it's ACTUALLY a psychological thriller, where the charming narrator who won you over in the beginning with his goofy rapping and self-deprecating humor slowly reveals himself to be a psychopath.You have to listen to this on audio, because Will performs his story with flair, rapping and playing the piano throughout, oozing his trademark Fresh Prince Charisma. However, without a sitcom script to recite, Smith veers into delusional tangents, self-indulgent life advice that no one could ever possibly benefit from (like: To all my young male readers-- don't force your wife to live on a giant family ranch if she says she doesn't want to live there), and a disturbing lack of empathy."Will" is infinitely quotable.

Despite being a carefully calibrated work of PR, Smith's gnawing need for approval spills forth as does his complete lack of interest in film as an artistic medium. He cites his box office numbers repetitively to the point of embarrassment. I like Smith's presence in films often but he's very rarely actually been involved in much that is substantial that isn't disposable Oscar bait, he cares much more about his brand than he does more abstract notions of cinema. The only film he spends any time discussing is Ali, one of the best decisions in the book as it is easily the high watermark of his career, he is otherwise more concerned with opening chapters with a chart of his films to hit #1 at the box office, never choosing to address the fact that stuff like MIB 2 is soulless commercial junk. He also comes off as an asshole pretty frequently and I cannot imagine attempting to tolerate him.45 likesLikeCommentSharon OrloppAuthor1 book323 followersNovember 21, 2022Wow! This book and its powerful leadership and life lessons will be with me for a very long time.Will Smith's biggest regret is not standing up for his mom when his dad punched her. He has always viewed himself as a coward.His father taught him an incredible work ethic that helped Will outwork and outperform his peers. He initially started out as a rapper. His grandmother asked him to not use any profanity in his lyrics. He and his partner, DJ Jazzy Jeff, received the first Grammy for a rap song---Parents Just Don't Understand. They boycotted the award ceremony because the award for rap would not be televised.Hip-hop helped him find his voice. The combination of hip-hop and humor made him untouchable. His rap name was Fresh Prince.One of the critical moments in his life was when he told his mom that he wasn't going to college. His mother was in education and felt very strongly that education couldn't be taken away from you. His father mediated the different opinions between Will and his mom and determined that Will would take a one year gap year and then start college. During that one year, he became a hip-hop star.Unfortunately or fortunately, depending on how you look at it, Will pissed away the earnings from his early hip-hop career and hadn't been paying taxes. He owed the IRS back taxes and his second album flopped. He went from hero to zero in a very short amount of time.Through serendipity, he met Benny Medina at The Arsenio Hall Show. Benny introduced him to Quincy Jones who had Will audition for the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air during Quincy's large birthday party. Will got the part and focused on entertainment and music.Some of the key leadership and life lessons Will shares in his memoir include:* The rules of logic do not apply to the laws of possibility.* Quincy Jones: Things are always impossible, right up until they're not.* Magic requires preparation, awareness and surrender.* Acting encompasses storytelling, performing, comedy, music, and teaching.* If we don't adapt, we become extinct.* Nothing lasts forever. Everything rises and falls.* Clarity of mission is the powerful cornerstone of success.* You are the creator of your own destiny.* The human mind is a storytelling machine.* We need our lives to mean something.* Great stories illuminate the truth.* Striving for perfection requires excellence from everyone.Will explores that the big dreamers (entrepreneurs, artists, musicians, thought leaders, innovators) are always challenged with the pursuit of their big dreams while at the same time trying to have thriving relationships. Think about Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, Nelson Mandela, Steve Jobs, JFK, etc.Will wanted to help the people he loved build extraordinary lives, but he discovered that might not have been what they wanted. He felt rejected if others didn't subscribe to his intoxicating energy, adventure, and incredible discipline. He felt some people crumble under the pressure of possibilities. He wanted to experience everything there was to see and do.Powerful, fast-paced memoir that I couldn't put down.

He rose to fame with a group of friends, and they’re still with him today. Will drew people into his orbit like the sun. And like a star that burns too long, there were times when he imploded. His success as an actor, musician, and writer is undeniable, but his struggles to be a good husband, father, son, and friend are what most readers will remember about this book. I highly recommend listening to the audiobook version. Will had me laughing, bobbing my head to his jams, and wiping my eyes a few times too.

I especially loved the part about his marriage when he said (paraphrasing) that your person you choose to spend life with is just as imperfect as you are. You can easily love them when they are doing right, making you smile or laugh. But the true test comes from the times that things are not going right and things are not so perfect. Can you love them then? Can you love their ugly? This book made me reflect a lot on my own life. It made me open areas that I thought I had vaulted. Time for me to get back to work!

It was seriously a chore to get through after a while and I just wanted him to stop talking. Sometimes, he just rambled about the most inane things, especially near the end.

Will Smith is incredibly insecure2. He seems like a fun and annoying friend3. WILL SMITH AND JADA SHOULD NOT BE MARRIED ANYMOREWill Smith has been famous for basically my entire life. I don't remember a time when his songs or tv show The Fresh Prince of Bel Air wasn't on. I love that show and can probably recite lines from several episodes by heart. Independence Day is a movie that while a bit overrated is still a great movie(its #7 on my list). When I think of my childhood it's Will Smith, Michael Jackson, Jason Weaver and Raven Symone.I was a little bit worried that I would dislike Will Smith and given The Slap Heard Around the Globe I wanted a deeper insight into the life and psychology of Will Smith....and I got that. Had I read this before he bossed up on Chris Rock, I wouldn't have been surprised by it at all. Will Smith has spent his entire life preparing to lose his shit. He is so pent up and neurotic, slapping Chris Rock was probably cathartic. His whole life he's felt weak and like he isn't tough enough to defend the women he loves.Reading this book made me feel sorry for Will Smith. He's rich and famous beyond my wildest dreams but my life is better. I'm not rich and nobody knows who the hell I am but my life is so much more happy and fulfilling. It's sad. Will Smith seems like a nice guy. A genuinely nice guy with cool buy weird kids and I want him to be happy. As much as I love Jada Pickett Smith as an actress and Black icon....her and Will should get divorced. They probably won't but I think they would be happier as friends who aren't married to each other.I enjoyed this book but it felt disjointed at times. I did learn alot about Will's earlier life but I felt like he really held back when discussing his marriages. Maybe in 10 or 20 more years he'll write Part II of his memoir and we'll get the real tea.I highly recommend it to fans of Will Smith....Who doesn't like Will Smith btw?2022-nonfictionafrican-american-authorbest-non-fiction...more26 likes7 commentsLikeCommentBrittany McCann1,577 reviews394 followersDecember 14, 2022This was good. Like REALLY good. I love Will, but having kind of lost touch with television and movies for much of the last decade, I have only been peripherally aware of what his latest life works have been. I have seen more of the Jada side when I can catch one of her Red Table Talks, which are always great for life speculation. However, I grew up with Will on my television and I always liked him. I watched Men in Black at least 500 times. It came out in my middle school years, and my friend and I would just always have it on no matter what was going on, it became somewhat of a comfort show.Will gets real and raw in this autobiography. He digs deep into his psyche and exposes things that were likely cathartic to share in general, let alone with us the readers. I got more out of this book than I have from most in my life. You have to listen to Will read it to get the full effect, to get the inflection and the emotion that he imbues into the telling.Will struggles and battles with his inner demons helped me take a harder look at my own issues, and the things that hold me back in life. This is a book worth reading, and it is one that I will definitely come back to and read again in the future.5 Stars, it's wonderful if you were ever or are currently a fan, and great for a soul searching read even if you aren't.5-starsbiographicalnon-fiction...more25 likes3 commentsLikeCommentBookNightOwl977 reviews169 followersDecember 4, 2021I highly enjoyed this read!

Along the way,Willtells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had.Will Smith’s transformation from a fearful child in a tense West Philadelphia home to one of the biggest rap stars of his era and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, with a string of box office successes that will likely never be broken, is an epic tale of inner transformation and outer triumph, andWilltells it astonishingly well. But it's only half the story.Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over.This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestsellerThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,Willis the story of how one person mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, putsWillthe book, like its author, in a category by itself.Listen to Will read from the audiobookAvailable for purchase at these retailersAudibleGoogle Play StoreKoboLibro.fmAudible UKBlack artists andbookstoresbring will to lifePenguin Press and Will Smith commissioned window displays from Black artists, based on chapters fromWill, to be displayed at Black-owned bookstores around the world.Artist:Alexander TamahnChapter 1: FearFulton Street Books & Coffeein Tulsa, OKArtist:Wutang McDougalChapter 3: PerformanceRofhiwa Book Caféin Durham, NCArtist:Sonia GaliberChapter 5: HopeUncle Bobbie’s Coffee & Booksin Philadelphia, PAArtist:Alex RiveraChapter 7: AdventureThe Lit.

But savoring a book of, say, 800 pages or longer is aproject. No book that size is perfect, because excess is kind of the point. What marathon runner doesn’t curse the universe or even get bored once in a while? That doesn’t negate the rush of endorphins or the thrill of mastery. If you power down your iPhone and power through to the end, one of these books might change your life.Don Quixote, by Miguel de Cervantes (1605, 976 pp.)The novel and the satire were born at the same time in this series of misadventures befalling the romance-besotted mad knight errant and his sane sidekick. The nested stories are very much rooted in post-medieval Spain, but the pratfalls are timeless; self-delusion knows no cultural barriers.Bleak House, by Charles Dickens (1853, 960 pp.)The great English novelist, here at his most grown-up, doesn’t do lawyers any favors. Following the money, he uses a single lawsuit over a dwindling inheritance to expose society’s role. But this is still Dickens: funny, heartfelt, and redemptive.War and Peace, by Leo Tolstoy (1869, 1,296 pp.)On top of everything else the Russian master accomplished in this historical novel about the Napoleonic era in Russia, he really nailed the title. By shifting focus from the battlefield to the home front and back, he captured the total effect of war on armies and aristocrats, husbands and wives.Middlemarch, by George Eliot (1872, 880 pp.)Eliot was a world-builder in the classic sense; her fictional Middlemarch is an English town like many others, exemplary of bourgeois mores and the site of many parallel plots. The epic is made ordinary, and vice versa.The Brothers Karamazov, by Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1880, 824 pp.)Europe’s original existentialist might have gone darker inCrime and Punishment, but he captures a larger universe here, from the portrait of a family whose members achieve Christly heights and Trumpian lows to cerebral set pieces that would blow most novellas out of the water.In Search of Lost Time, by Marcel Proust (1913–1927, 4,215 pp.)It isn’t cheating to say that Proust’s series is really a novel. Even more than a few others here, this is a unified work — gorgeously written, recursive but not repetitive, and profound even when chronicling the shallowest of socialites.Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A Journey Through Yugoslavia, by Rebecca West (1941, 1,181 pp.)Interest in West’s book, a category-killer in several categories (travel book, cultural history, memoir), revived during the Balkan wars in the ‘90s  — which is appropriate for a book written on the eve of Nazi invasion. But as a wholly engrossing, never-flagging work of poetic journalism, it’s always worth reading.The Man Without Qualities, by Robert Musil (1943, 1,744 pp.)If Musil’s colossus of philosophical and social fiction seems to peter out, that’s because he never finished it. But dissipation of the novel, whose title character is a reflective blank, mirrors the decadence of Viennese society around World War I — prosperous, rule-bound, beautiful, and doomed.The Lord of the Rings, by J. R. R. Tolkien (1955, 1,178 pp.)The trilogy is available in single volumes and best read that way. The pioneer of modern fantasy was also its perfecter, because he knew what it meant to create a universe. A professional linguist, Tolkien didn’t just invent; he used everything he’d learned and made it new.Life and Fate, by Vasily Grossman (1959, 896 pp.)Though often compared toWar and Peace, the long-suppressed World War II novel has more in common with war journalism, which Grossman practiced as a Soviet reporter on the front. He emerged from bloody battle with both a great story and a sly critique of the century’s two great monsters — Hitler and the one at home.The Power Broker, by Robert Caro (1974, 1,336 pp.)Before he embarked on his multivolume biography of Lyndon B. Johnson, Caro wrought justice on Robert Moses, cementing the uber-bureaucrat’s reputation as a destroyer of New York’s urban fabric in a masterpiece of very longform adversarial journalism.Shogun, by James Clavell (1975, 1,192 pp.)A triumph of research and plot over character and subtlety, Clavell’s historical novel about an Englishmen who goes native with the first Japanese shogun is the first among equals of the James Michener era of middlebrow informational epics.Canopus in Argos: Archives, by Doris Lessing (1979–1984, 1,228 pp.)This may the deepest dive into sci-fi (Lessing called it “space fiction”) that any Nobel Prize–winner has ever attempted — five linked novels telling the universe’s secret history in the stories of interrelated planet-civilizations. Come for the fiction, not the science.The Stand, by Stephen King (1978/1990, 823/1,152 pp.)The original edition of King’s apocalyptic moral fable and the “Complete and Uncut” updated version both have their partisans. Good and evil are complicated but simply drawn, as in his more typical horror fiction. But given the space, King excels at texture. Which is to say, if you’re in for 800 pages, you might as well go uncut.The Pillars of the Earth, by Ken Follett (1989, 816 pp.)Like Lessing and King, suspense writer Follett went for broke in a genre new to him. Like the groundbreaking (and fictional) Gothic cathedral that rises in the course of his 12th-century-British historical work, the best seller soars, sprawls, and brims with humanity’s gargoyles.The Hunchback of Notre Dame,by Victor Hugo (1833, 940 pp.)Pairs well withThe Pillars of the Earth.A Suitable Boy, by Vikram Seth (1993, 1,349 pp.)Seth’s story, which follows one family’s search for their daughter’s perfect match but also India’s transition from feudal colony to partitioned mega-state, is so vast that it requires not one but four family trees in the front. Yet his language is unadorned and accessible; nothing gets in the way of the story.Infinite Jest, by David Foster Wallace (1996, 1,079 pp.)Somehow the most difficult and the most approachable four-figure-page book you’ll read, Wallace’s monumental compendium of dystopia, comedy, tennis, drug recovery, and high-impact footnotes has been alternately under- and overrated for 20 years. It won’t likely be forgotten.Underworld, by Don DeLillo (1997, 827 pp.)Probably the best very long novel of the last century, it’s a Great American one, too, and a pure distillation of New York, from its home-run opening (the “Shot Heard Round the World” that won the Giants the 1951 pennant) to the glories and horrors of the then-present day, which is where that winning baseball ends up.Shantaram, by Gregory David Roberts (2004, 936 pp.)Bombay and bombast reign in Roberts’s fictionalized account of his escape from an Australian prison to India, where, in swashbuckling scene after narrow escape, he is tortured, sexed up, and enlisted in a gang of Afghan gunrunners. Who cares how much it’s true, or literary? Even when unintentionally funny, it’s enormous fun.2666, by Roberto Bolaño (2004, 912 pp.)The structure of the late pan-Latin author’s magnum opus is deviously simple — the mystery of a writer’s identity explored in five “Parts.” The first is playful, about literary academics; the fourth is a deliberately numbing catalogue of gruesome murders. Across all chapters, the sentences beguile and the story devastates.Against the Day, by Thomas Pynchon (2006, 1,086 pp.)A glorious mess in a career of glorious messes, Pynchon’s longest and loosest novel floats and careens along with the Chums of Chance — the crew of a time-traveling interdimensional airship that becomes embroiled in a Western revenge story, a Siberian disaster, and the invention of thermodynamics. Don’t ask — just read.Sacred Games,by Vikram Chandra (2007, 928 pp.)There’s a kind of reader who gets off on the juxtaposition of a gripping genre plot and an indecipherable dialect. It may not be the common reader, and Chandra’s detective-noir-on-steroids-in-Hinglish failed to meet too-high sales expectations. That’s too bad, because the near-apocalyptic payoff is well worth the effort.1Q84, by Haruki Murakami (2011, 928 pp.)America’s favorite Japanese writer on American-pop themes has earned the right to go big in this deep, indulgent dive, featuring a semi-fantastic world with two moons, an assassin, and a ghostwriter on a collision course, and a cult that may or may not be evil. Love it or not, it’s pure, uncut Murakami.The Neapolitan Novels, by Elena Ferrante (2012–2015, 1,682 pp.)The once-anonymous Italian novelist considers her four books — mostly about two female friends living divergent lives in patriarchal, violent, stratified Naples — to be a single novel, so we should too.Never mind the author’s identity; the cycle is a woman’s enduring testament to art, life, and realism.Jerusalem,by Alan Moore (2016, 1,280 pp.)If you can’t decide between a modern version ofFinnegan’s Wake, a cranky essay collection bya beloved comic writer(Watchmenet al.), the 2,000-year history of an English micro-neighborhood, the cosmic adventures of a child ghost, a narrative poem, or dozens more fever dreams of a maniacal genius, read them all here.Tags:vulture listsbookslong readsmust reads+CommentsLeave a Comment26 Long Books Worth the Time They Take to ReadThings you buy through our links may earnVox Mediaa commission.Most Viewed StoriesSuccessionDid It in Episode ThreeMillie Bobby Brown to Permanently Enter the House of Bon JoviBrian Cox Is Happy You Know That About Logan Roy Now‘It Needed to Be an Unbroken Performance’What’s Going on with Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn?SuccessionDid It in Episode ThreeSuccessionRecap: Heavily Fuckin’ Delayed‘It Needed to Be an Unbroken Performance’Brian Cox Is Happy You Know That About Logan Roy Now‘It Made Me Believe That Love Wasn’t Real Anymore.

Smith has asked producers about a “cameo” on the show according to British newspaper “The Sun” Smith, 41, says he became hooked on the gritty drama while promoting “Seven Pounds” in the UK: “I was just chilling in my hotel and “EastEnders” was on TV. I didn’t even know what it was, but I literally could not stop watching it. American soaps are all about the beautiful people and being cheesy. This soap had everything. I’m a bit busy but when things quiet down I’d love to do a cameo. I could make a big entrance in the pub, as you guys call it, and be like: ‘Hey, girl let’s take this outside.’ ”COMPANY INFORMATIONOur CompanyCustomer ServiceEssence VenturesChange Your AddressContact UsJob OpportunitiesInternshipsMedia KitSUBSCRIBENewslettersGive a Gift of ESSENCEMagazine Tablet EditionFOLLOW USMORE ON ESSENCEHomeLoveCelebrityBeautyHairFashionESSENCE festivalESSENCE.com is part of ESSENCE Communications, Inc.Essence may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.

Will Smith: Hard work and luck propel him far beyond his dreamsNewsSportsEntertainmentLifestyleAdvertiseObituarieseNewspaperLegalsSubscribeLOCALWill Smith: Hard work and luck propel him far beyond his dreamsLuaine Lee, Scripps Howard News ServiceWhen he was growing up, actor Will Smith's father always used to tell him there was no such thing as good luck; applying himself with dedication was all that it took to achieve success.He took him at his word."My whole life my father always said that," recalls Mr. Smith, as he eases into the plump cushions of a green overstuffed chair in a Los Angeles hotel suite."My father always made it very clear to me just do one thing well, just concentrate and focus. If you do one thing well everything else will come from that."That was before Smith and Co. went into the stratosphere with the smash sci-fi hit of last summer, "Independence Day.""After the opening weekend of 'Independence Day,' my father called me on the phone and said, 'Remember when I told you that all you had to do was work hard and you could have anything you want? Remember when I told you there ain't no such thing as luck?'"I said, 'Yeah, dad, I remember.'"He said, 'That's BS. You're the luckiest (expletive) I ever met!' "Will Smith collapses in laughter. He's spent half his life applying his father's dictum, but along with his hard work, there was a spoonful of luck.The young actor who starred in NBC's family sitcom, "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," for six years became interested in rap music when he was only 12.He and co-rapper Jeff Townes linked up when Will Smith was 13 and they cut their first record as D.J. Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince in 1986. the time he was 20, Mr. Smith had already earned a Grammy."When I released my first record, my biggest dream was to hear it on the radio. I just wanted to hear someone else listen to my record on the radio. From that point, I've been completely beyond my dreams, from that day completely beyond everything I ever dreamed about. Everything keeps growing."Mr. Smith, who gave up a scholarship at MIT to pursue music, says he still works hard."And I'm a student of industry. I watch what people do and make really calculated decisions about the things I do and my performances. But I'm blessed," he says, raising his hands in a thankful gesture.Mr. Smith stars in his second big summer movie, "Men in Black," co-starring Tommy Lee Jones, opening July 2. But being an actor was never part of his plans.His first two videos, "Parents Just Don't Understand" and "I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson," showed cinematic promise. But when Mr. Smith's agent arranged for him to audition for "The Cosby Show," he was too frightened to go.Fear, as much as anything, has been a propellant for the Philadelphia-born actor. "My biggest fear is to be scared of something," he says, tapping the arm of the couch with his fingers."I can't function knowing that I'm scared of something. Like I can't swim. I was at this place called Rick's Cafe in Jamaica where there's a cliff that hangs out over the water and people are jumping off this cliff -- about a 100-foot drop into this water. It was killing me so much to be scared of it that I just ran and jumped off. That's my reaction to fear."The same thing happened with the TV show. I was so scared, so petrified that I just attacked, arrrgh," he says, punching the air.The idea of packaging this young African-American actor in a sitcom came from one of his managers and entrepreneur Quincy Jones. Mr. Smith went along for the ride."The first thing I discovered was that I wasn't really good," he grins. "I had some work I needed to do. My biggest discovery -- and having a live audience made it easier because you can try things and they work or they don't work -- the big thing I learned is you can't worry. You can't care. You gotta go out and give everything you've got. Either they like it or they don't like it. You've got to be what you are and see how people react to it."Assuming a role in a stage play was an even riskier step. As the imposter who cons his way into the home of an upscale Manhattan couple in "Six Degrees of Separation," Mr. Smith remembers that as the hardest time of his life."I was a newlywed, had a brand- new baby and was doing the hardest thing I've ever had to do in entertainment. That was a really stressful, really difficult time and I learned lot about myself and a lot about life in general."Now split from his wife, Sheree Zampino, Mr. Smith is in a relationship with actress Jada Pinkett ("The Nutty Professor").In spite of his supersonic rise, Mr. Smith has managed to maintain his equilibrium. Once again -- like his father said -- it's a matter of focus."With music I had the ups and downs on a smaller scale," he says. "What I found is when you're up, the way that you pad your fall -- because inevitably I'm going to fall -- the way you pad your fall is on your way up. The more people you're nice to, as you're falling, those are the people who are going to put their hands out and try to stop you from falling. So on your way up is where you need to prepare yourself for your fall. When you fall, you don't want people kicking you down."Photo by Andy SchwartzWill Smith cradles an alien critter in "Men In Black," which opens Wednesday.CareersAccessibilitySite MapLegalsOur Ethical PrinciplesSubscription Terms & ConditionsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy Rights / Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyStaff DirectoryContact UsSupport Local BusinessAdvertise Your BusinessAdvertising Terms and ConditionsBuy and SellLicensing & ReprintsHelp CenterSubscriber GuideMy AccountGive FeedbackSubscribe TodayNewslettersFacebookTwittereNewspaperArchivesInstagramJobsCarsHomesClassifiedsReviewed.com10BestLocaliQ Digital Marketing SolutionsUSA TODAY Sports+© 2023 www.southcoasttoday.com.

A hero can be a regular person; it doesn't have to be someone famous. He or she could be a firefighter who saves lives or just a funny actor who makes people laugh. A hero to me is a person who stands up for what they believe in no matter what the consequences. Heroes put their lives at risk to save another's. They are people who overcome their difficulties. Again, a hero doesn't have to be famous. It could be your best friend who helped you get through tough times or a family member who helped you get into college or study for your midterm.My hero is Will Smith. He is a great actor who plays funny roles. He also is very faithful to his wife and kids. This shows what a great person he is. Sometimes actors who are very famous seem to get tied up in their work and don't have that much time to be with their kids. But Will always makes time for his kids and family, which shows how much he cares.He also makes me laugh. I grew up watching "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" and it always made me laugh. But it also had some very serious topics in certain episodes. For example, in one episode, Carlton, Will's cousin, gets robbed and Will gets shot in the leg. Carlton feels like he should avenge his brother. Will teaches Carlton to not pick up a gun and do something he would regret. It was a very serious scene. Carlton gave Will the gun and Will began to cry. This teaches that revenge will cause more problems than it will solve. I thought Will was a hero in this particular episode because he taught children a good lesson.Willard Christopher Smith Jr. was born into a loving family in Philadelphia. His parents were Caroline and Willard Smith Jr. Will was the second of four children. While growing up, he adopted the nickname "French Prince." He got this nickname for his slick way of getting out of bad situations. He met Jeff Townes at a party and they started working making music albums as Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince. They quickly became popular. Will then made a lot of money, which he spent on cars and a house.Then he met Benny Medina in 1989. Benny had an idea of Will starring in a sitcom based on his life in Beverly Hills. Both he and NBC approved of the idea. In 1990, they aired his new show, “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air”. The plot of the show was simple: Will played himself, a hysterical, street-smart west Philly kid that was transported to Beverly Hills by his mother, who wanted Will to become a civilized human being. Instead, Will turned his uncle's and cousins' lives upside down with his dancing, loud music and mischief. The series lasted 6 years. The critics then took note of him in the movie “Six Degrees of Separation” (1993) and the success that came in the action picture “Bad Boys” (1995). Wills career was set!Will has the great ability of making people laugh. He is important to me because he is great with his kids and wife and can make me laugh. He teaches valuable morals and lessons. He is a great person to look up to, both on the screen and off. Will made a difference in my life by bringing happiness and laughter into my life after a rough day.Will is a phenomenal actor. He often plays a funny role or a stubborn detective or agent. He always makes me laugh with his funny outfits and weird dance moves. He is a great comedian, parent and actor. This is why Will Smith is my hero.SharePage created on 3/13/2013 10:40:55 AMLast edited 9/12/2018 5:38:26 PMThe beliefs, viewpoints and opinions expressed in this hero submission on the website are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the beliefs, viewpoints and opinions of The MY HERO Project and its staff.ABOUTHELPPRIVACYEXPLORETEACHERSSITE MAPDMCA Notification© 2020 The MY HERO Project, Inc.

And, it turns out, those athletes who are idols in their own rightat this very momenthad their own guiding stars when they were growing up. So we asked more than 100 of today's biggest pro athletes who they looked up to when they were youngsters."I loved thatLisa Lesliewas really tall and skinny like me.

My mother worked for the school board in Philadelphia, so home was a learning environment. My dad had been in the Air Force and in a way our house was like a military household and very disciplined. I’m one of four children - I have two sisters and a brother - and we had to roll our underwear up in the drawers along with our socks and put them in neat little lines. There were hospital corners on the beds. But you know, learning that kind of discipline was good in lots of ways and that carried over into school. My parents always emphasised that doing your best at school was important.I went to Overbrook High in Philadelphia and my favourite teacher was Miss Brenda Brown. I was 14 and she was my home room teacher, which I guess is like a form tutor in the UK - the teacher you can go to for advice about what was going on.Miss Brown was gentle and caring and would talk as long as you wanted to, but she was also firm and decisive. That was a good combination and you always knew where the boundaries were. She was one of the first teachers I had who made me feel bad for disappointing her.I guess I was a good student and I think Miss Brown took me for some subjects as well as being my home room teacher, but to be honest I can’t remember what subjects she taught me. It’s more the overall impression she gave me and the advice she handed out. You know, sensible things, like don’t lose sight of your goals, encouragement, like “you can do this, you know you can”. I knew she was there for me if I needed her. She would stay as late as you needed to, or you could even go to her house. She lived near to the school and if you wanted to check on something or ask her a question, you could go and knock on her door and she would invite you in.That’s pretty cool and not every teacher gives that kind of commitment to their kids. Miss Brown did.I live in California but go back to Philadelphia a lot and have been to Overbrook many times. Miss Brown is still there and she’s always the first person I go to see when I get there. People are very proud that I’m from that school and from my home town so it’s always nice to go back. I’m proud of that school too. And I’m grateful to Miss Brown because she was a great teacher.This was first published in Tes magazine in January, 2007.Born: Philadelphia, 1968Education: Our Lady of Lourdes, Overbrook High School, both PhiladelphiaCareer: Will Smith, the Oscar nominated actor, is famous for appearances in Independence Day, Men in Black and The Pursuit of Happiness.You’ve reached your limit of free articles this monthRegister for free to read moreYou can read two more articles onTesfor free this month if you register using the button below.Alternatively, you can subscribe for just £1 per month for the next three months and get:Unlimited access to all Tes magazine contentExclusive subscriber-only articlesEmail newslettersSubscribe nowRegisterAlready registered?Log inYou’ve reached your limit of free articles this monthSubscribe to read moreYou can subscribe for just £1 per month for the next three months and get:Unlimited access to all Tes magazine contentExclusive subscriber-only articlesEmail newslettersSubscribe nowThis is0of1Now only £1 a month for 3 monthsSubscribe for just £1 per month for the next 3 months to get unlimited access to all Tes magazine content.

GrahamPublishedFeb 4, 2022Joyce Abbott remembers every one of her students — the ones who struggled and the ones who soared.She wasn’t surprised that Quinta Brunson, one of her sixth graders at Andrew Hamilton Elementary in West Philadelphia, became successful. But Abbott did a double take when her daughter heard on social media that Brunson, a comedian and writer, had anew TV show debuting.“She said, ‘Mom, Quinta’s creating this showAbbott Elementary. I know it has something to do with you, I just know,’” said Abbott.That would beAbbott Elementary, the hit ABC show written, produced, and starring Brunson, inspired by Brunson’s own teacher mom. It’s about a fictional,underfunded Philadelphiapublic school that’s a lot like Hamilton, where Abbott still works — the needs are great and the budget is slim, but thestaff caresand the kids are a joy.AdvertisementAnd yes, the name is no coincidence. Brunson chose “Willard Abbott Elementary” as a nod to West Philly icon Will Smith and to her favorite teacher, whose life has gotten a lot busier since the show first aired and learned that Brunson wanted to reconnect with her.Abbott, who taught Brunson in 2000-01 and last saw her at eighth-grade graduation in 2003, soon got the call.“We talked that night for close to an hour,” said Abbott. “We were both crying.”Brunson was a strong student at Hamilton, but a shy one. She volunteered for everything and she was so determined that she wept if she earned a B.“She was an awesome student,” Abbott said. “Sometimes she was too hard on herself — she was so driven for excellence.”» READ MORE:‘Abbott Elementary’ is full of Philly references. Here’s a list of all of them.Though they talked and texted regularly, they haven’t met up in person — yet. But they had a virtual meetup onJimmy Kimmel Liveon Tuesday, with Abbott in Philadelphia surprising her former student in Los Angeles. Brunson wiped tears from her eyes when she saw Abbott on the screen.“Oh, my gosh, I’m so proud of you,” Abbott told Brunson. Kimmel later surprised Abbott, who has plans to retire soon, with a five-day vacation. (Abbott and Brunson plan to meet in personthe next time Brunson is in Philadelphia, Abbott said.)Former students have been flooding Abbott’s inbox. When Abbott was getting her COVID-19 booster shot and her daughter mentioned thatAbbott Elementarywas named for her mother, someone asked Abbott to take a picture with her.It’s been overwhelming but lovely. And she’s still trying to wrap her mind around inspiring a pupil who went on to write and star in a TV show about Philadelphia schoolsthat she named for her.“It means a lot,” Abbott said. “It’s not that I do the work to be recognized — I’ve never done the work to be recognized. The kids know, the students know, and that’s all that matters.”Instead, the reward is her students’ pride in their own hard work, their realization that they can do difficult things, their coming back to visit, telling her about the goalsthey accomplished after her classroom.To get there, Abbott has never shied away from hard work herself. (”I give 150 to 200%,” she estimates.) Teaching isn’t a 9-to-3 job, no matter what time the bells ring. She made sacrifices to get there, dipped into her own pocket for supplies or groceries for a child’s family, sat with students in hospitals, and answered her own front door to see students on her porch. It’s exhausting sometimes.But “when you believe in them, you put in the work,” said Abbott. “It’s more than a job. You have to give these kids a chance if they want to make it out of neighborhoods. The only way is for them to be educated.”Abbott herself grew up in West Philadelphia and graduated from public schools — Overbrook for high school.She earned a business degree and joined the Army, serving in Desert Storm, then became a teacher through a program that helped veterans earn education degrees. She spent a year at Shaw Middle School, then went to Hamilton, where she’s worked for 25 years. After a long career mostly as a sixth-grade teacher, Abbott became Hamilton’s dean of students and then climate manager, responsible for keeping the school safe and orderly. She mediates conflict, presides over admission and dismissal, and meets with parents.» READ MORE:There’s a new sitcom about Philly public schools. So we asked a city teacher to review itAbbott hasn’t missed an episode ofAbbott Elementary, and she said she’d love the show even if she had no association with it.The show has resonated with so many Philadelphia educators not because of the inside jokes about “jawn” and South Philadelphia mobsters, but because it reflects the lengths to which teachers go for their students. When Brunson’s Janine Teagues made an impassioned speech about all of her students being gifted, Abbott nodded.All of her kids deserve the best, Abbott firmly believes. That’s why she pushed them so hard: Speak in complete sentences. “A’s” are not easy to get. You are not “below basic,” the lowest designation on standardized tests, so don’t act that way.“You should be able to come through these doors and get the quality of a private education if not better,” said Abbott.That was what she strove for in her classroom: strong education and positive life experiences. When Brunson was a sixth grader, students held pretzel sales and assembled hoagies to earn enough money for a stretch limo ride and gourmet dinner at the swanky Chart House at the end of the school year. Abbott coached them on what a salad fork looked like and how to talk to and tip the limo driver with class funds set aside for that purpose.Abbott rejected suggestions that they aim a little lower, take a school bus to the Olive Garden or TGI Friday’s.“When you work hard, you get the best,” Abbott said. “When you see the best, you’re going to strive.”And while Brunson’s acclaim is a feather in Abbott’s cap as a teacher, that doesn’t dim the accomplishments of the young lady who went on to be a hair stylist or the young man who came to sixth grade struggling to read, who spent Abbott’s prep periods in her room going over basic readers one-on-one with her. He’s now in the Air Force.“Some of them, it was a struggle just to make it out of high school,” said Abbott, “but they made it, and I am equally proud of them.”PublishedFeb. 4, 2022Kristen A.

Smith subsequently resigned fromthe Academyand was banned from attending all Academy functions, including the Oscars, for ten years.[14]Early lifeSmith was born and raised inPhiladelphiaas Willard Carroll Smith II on September 25, 1968,  to Caroline (née Bright), a school board administrator, and Willard Carroll Smith Sr.,[15][16]a US Air Force veteran[17]and refrigeration engineer. His mother graduated fromCarnegie Mellon University.[18]Smith grew up in West Philadelphia'sWynnefieldneighborhood[19]and was raisedBaptist.[20]He has an elder sister named Pamela and two younger siblings, twins Harry and Ellen.[19]He attended Our Lady of Lourdes, a private Catholic elementary school in Philadelphia,[21]andOverbrook High School.[22]His parents separated when he was 13[23]and divorced around the year 2000.[24]Smith began rapping at age 12. When his grandmother found a notebook of his lyrics, which he described as containing "all [his] little curse words", she wrote him a note on a page in the book: "Dear Willard, truly intelligent people do not have to use words like this to express themselves. Please show the world that you're as smart as we think you are". Smith said that this influenced his decision not to use profanity in his music.[25]CareerFurther information:Will Smith filmography,Will Smith discography, andList of awards and nominations received by Will Smith1985–1992: DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh PrinceSmith at the Emmy Awards 1993Smith started as theMCof the hip-hop duoDJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, with his childhood friendJeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townesasturntablistand producer.[26]Townes and Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smith's residence, and he was missing hishype man. Smith decided to fill in. They both felt strong chemistry, and Townes was upset when his hype man finally made it to the party.[27]Soon after, the two decided to join forces. Smith enlisted a friend to join as the beatboxer of the group, Clarence Holmes akaReady Rock C, making them a trio. Philadelphia-based Word Records released their first single in 1986 whenA&RmanPaul Oakenfold[28]introduced them to Champion Records with their single "Girls Ain't Nothing but Trouble," a tale of funny misadventures that landed Smith and his former DJ and rap partner Mark Forrest (Lord Supreme) in trouble.[29]The song sampled the theme song of "I Dream of Jeannie." Smith became known for light-hearted story-telling raps and capable, though profanity-free, "battle" rhymes. The single became a hit a month before Smith graduated from high school.[30]Based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention ofJive RecordsandRussell Simmons. The duo's first album,Rock the House, which was first released on Word Up in 1986 debuted on Jive in March 1987. The group received the firstGrammy Award for Best Rap Performancein 1989 for "Parents Just Don't Understand" (1988), though their most successful single was "Summertime" (1991), which earned the group their second Grammy and peaked at number 4 on theBillboardHot 100. Smith and Townes are still friends and claim that they never split up, having made songs under Smith's solo performer credit.[31]Smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes.[26]TheInternal Revenue Serviceeventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, andgarnishedhis income.[32]Smith was struggling financially in 1990 when theNBCtelevision network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him.[26]The show was successful and began his acting career. Smith set for himself the goal of becoming "the biggest movie star in the world", studyingbox office successes' common characteristics.[23]In 1989, Smith was arrested in relation to an alleged assault on his record promoter, William Hendricks; the charges were later dismissed.[33]1993–1997: Solo music and film breakthroughSmith's first major roles were in the dramaSix Degrees of Separation(1993) and the action filmBad Boys(1995) in which he starred oppositeMartin Lawrence. The latter film was commercially successful, grossing $141.4 million worldwide.[34]However, critical reception was generally mixed.[35]In 1996, Smith starred as part of an ensemble cast inRoland Emmerich'sIndependence Day.

At least, that's been the excuse, although judging by the finished product, it was the script that never lived up to the promise of its premise."[97]Later that year, Smith had his second starring role in an animated film, inSpies in Disguise, oppositeTom Holland.

When his grandmother found a notebook of his lyrics, which he described as containing "all [his] little curse words", she wrote him a note on a page in the book: "Dear Willard, truly intelligent people do not have to use words like this to express themselves. Please show the world that you're as smart as we think you are". Smith said that this influenced his decision not to use profanity in his music.[25]CareerFurther information:Will Smith filmography,Will Smith discography, andList of awards and nominations received by Will Smith1985–1992: DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh PrinceSmith at the Emmy Awards 1993Smith started as theMCof the hip-hop duoDJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, with his childhood friendJeffrey "DJ Jazzy Jeff" Townesasturntablistand producer.[26]Townes and Smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as Townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from Smith's residence, and he was missing hishype man.

At least, that's been the excuse, although judging by the finished product, it was the script that never lived up to the promise of its premise."[97]Later that year, Smith had his second starring role in an animated film, inSpies in Disguise, oppositeTom Holland. Smith voiced Lance Sterling, a spy who teams up with the nerdy inventor who creates his gadgets (Holland).[98]In 2020, he reteamed with Martin Lawrence for the third film in their franchise,Bad Boys for Life.

He won over 40 academy awards to prove it. You will probably never get bored with his movies; a lot of them are good. The guy is also so humble with his fans. There are so many things that make him my favorite actor, but I can's list them all, basically will smith the actor is my favorite.You could easily distinguish whatever characters he plays.  For example, in the movie “Hancock”, I could be saying, "Oh Hancock is that bad ass guy who doesn't care what others think”. In “I Am Legend” he plays guy is the survivor guy, who even though he doesn't want to do some things, he still sacrifices things and keeps going strong.  When he starred in the movie “The Pursuit of Happiness”, the role he played was perfectly done.  It was so well performed and felt genuine, which is why I enjoy watching his films.My favorite actress is Mila Kunis.  I would have to say this because of her astounding beauty, her great personality, and her sense of humor.  She won six Golden Globes and played in two of my favorite TV shows, “That’s 70’s Show” and of course “Family Guy”.  In all the movies she has been featured in I believe that everyone was an instant blockbuster, which is why she is my favorite actress.Her performance in “Black Swan” honestly was a bit odd, but she sold the part perfectly.  Her role was very difficult and complicated, but made it look easy while also looking sexy while doing it.  She is also known for the comedy “Ted”.  In my eyes, this movie was one of the best comedies of the movie so far.  I don’t really have a list of favorite actresses because usually like the one that looks the best, but if I did have one she would definitely be on it.In brief, my favorite actor is Will Smith and my favorite actress is Mila Kunis.  Will Smith is funny, humble, and plays any role like he has been doing it his whole life.  Mila Kunis is sexy, has a great personality, and is also very funny.  They are both great at what they do and have several awards to prove it, so it is no surprise that more people will agree with me.View Writing IssuesYou May Also Find These Documents HelpfulGood EssaysFive Types of Actors282 Words2 PagesFive Types of ActorsStar- star is a dististinctive persona, who is well known and popular.

The scene where he gives his daughter the invisible, impenetrable  cloak was easy for most people to empathize with because he was being a good father by making his daughter feel safe. He is one of the most touching characters because even when the Iranian man is yelling at him and treating him badly, he tries to explain to him that the door needs to be fixed, and not the lock that he keeps requesting. Sandra Bullock’s racism visibly disturbs and insults Michael Pena when he is fixing her lock, because Sandra is yelling at her husband that the man “with the jail tattoos” is going to go give their keys to one of his “homies” so they can break in and steal from them. Michael does not say anything though, but he makes sure to leave all of the keys on the counter in front of her when he leaves to show her that she is wrong.…1385 Words4 PagesPowerful EssaysRead MoreGood EssaysJack Nicholson Research Paper386 Words2 PagesJack Nicholson Research PaperJack Nicholson, an American actor, producer, screenwriter and director, is a three-time Academy Award winner and 12-time nominee.

(Here’s looking at you, Backstreet Boys fans.)I attended my first concert 40 years ago today. The band wasJourney– a prototype power pop quintet – and their new album, “Escape,” was a smash. My friend Rob and I asked our parents about attending – we were only 13 – and faster than you can say “Stone in Love,” we both had general admission tickets, purchased for $12.50 each at Rainbow Records, with an up-and-coming Canadian act (Loverboy) as the opener.The show was held at theCow Palace– an unheralded venue best known for having hosted the 1964 Republican convention. Most of what I remember are peripheral details. Rob and I brought girls (cool), we traveled to the Cow Palace in a groovy van (very cool), two of Rob’s older brothers were also with us (extremely cool), but so were our parents (less cool).The music was louder than anything I’d ever heard – my ears were still ringing the following morning in science class – and the acoustics were awful. The event was also the smokiest I’d ever experienced, and even as a young teen I knew that not all the fumes were emanating from tobacco-based products.The only musical moment I remember was the lead singer, Steve Perry, outfitted inyellow leopard print shirt, jeans, and high tops, crooning the hit single “Don’t Stop Believin’” in his distinctive falsetto voice. When he arrived at the line about a city boy who was “born and raised in south Detroit,” he subbed in “South San Francisco.” The Bay Area crowd went bonkers. To memorialize the experience, I bought aJourney shirt, which I still own.Concerts today are much more staid affairs, with reserved seats, no smoking, and the volume low enough to ensure one’s eardrums remain intact. But the rock concert experience can still be breathtaking. And everyone’s first concert should be committed to memory – with an embarrassing story to tell about it to enliven those dinner parties that inevitably turn dull.Related Topics:Matthew ReesCommentShow commentsHide CommentsLog In with your RCMG AccountRegisterMarket OverviewFinancial Marketsby TradingViewSign up for RC newsletters©RealClearMarkets |Do Not Sell My Personal Information|Go to full site

From casual music fans to musicians themselves, and music journalists like all of us here at Far Out, everyone knows how going to concerts can make memories that last a lifetime.Chad Smith of the rock bandRed Hot Chili Pepperscan attest to this, as his very first concert was one for the books. In an interview, he toldSiriusXM about it, “I was 13 at the time, and I was a huge KISS fan. I bought into the whole fire-breathing, blood-spitting, pyro, drums that go 30 feet in the air…Musically, you know, it was okay, which I probably will stick to till this day. I had an older brother who was like ‘Zeppelin is way better. KISS sucks!’ But then I was like, ‘Yeah, but Jimmy Page doesn’t fucking spit fucking blood! They don’t blow shit up…'”He continues his story, “Anyway, so that really appealed to a 13-year-old Chad, so I really wanted to see them, and they were supposed to play with Blue Oyster Cult at a venue called Pine Knob. And KISS cancelled.”We can see already where his story is going. The drummer explained: “And so I had to wait until they played Cobo Hall, May 16th, 1975. It was $7.50 for the ticket, so my brother’s like, ‘You know, two weeks ago, or whenever it was, I wrote the check and I put a little note in, and it was that Queen was coming, and so I put a note in that said Queen is my favourite band and I love Freddy Mercury, blah blah blah…can I have 10th row on the aisle?’ I go, ‘Did you get tickets?’ and [he said] ‘No, but I think you should do that’.”Smith would not be deterred: “And so, I wrote, ‘Please Mrs. Box Office Lady, KISS is my favourite band and I lovePeter Crissand I’m a drummer.’ I laid it on thick. I said, ‘Can I have 10th row on the aisle?’ and I got 12th row, on the aisle, centre. And I, you know, I’m hoping some lady took pity on poor young Chad… ‘My first concert!’, you know?”He also colours in a few more of the details, “One of the guys I went with was an older guy in the neighbourhood, with a car. Jackie Davidson. Me and Jackie and my brother and Brian Piffer, we go, and he’s like, ‘I know where the backstage is, I know where to go. I really want to meet KISS.’ And this was a time when you never saw them without their makeup on or anything. And he goes to the door and he knocks on the door and he comes back out, and he goes, ‘They’re not here, but I got these stickers!'”And what were those stickers in question? Actual backstage passes. “I still have [them] to this day. KISS, spring, 1975.” But the story doesn’t end there. He continues, “But he goes, ‘I know they’re still here’, so we drive around Cobo Hall, and we wait, and we see two big, long, black limousines, and we’re like, ‘They’ve got to be coming out.'”He concludes, “And, sure enough, three guys come out, and no one else is there except us, and we run up there and I got my little sticker. Ace Frehley signs it. Peter Criss was there, and Gene Simmons. And so we got to meet KISS without their makeup on. My first concert ever—life-changing, mind-blowing experience.”There are few moments in one’s life you could call “life-changing” but your first rock and roll show is certainly one of them.Most popular×Search×Subscribe to our newsletterDelivering curated contentEmail address:Leave this field empty if you're human:Jobs / CareersContact Us© 2023 Far Out Magazine

We take a look back at the ten most memorable characters he's portrayed.It's not every day that an actor can be truly called an icon of his generation. Such high praise is reserved for actors with truly impressive range and versatility in their roles and projects, as well as true demonstrated talents and accolades. When it comes to actors that got their start in the 1990s and have truly only been getting better since then, it's clear that Will Smith is far and away one of the most iconic actors.RELATED:Every Upcoming Will Smith MovieSmith has come a long way since his beginnings as a rapper. While he still dabbles in music occasionally, he's gone from television to the big screen and never looked back, racking up awards and award nominations at every turn. Here, we take a look back at the most memorable roles in Smith's filmography so far and how they compare to each other.Deadshot (Suicide Squad)Frankly speaking,Suicide Squadwas a mess, as most other films in the DCEU have been so far. But Will Smith's work as Floyd Lawton, also known as Deadshot, was unarguably one of the film's high points.  Few actors would have been able to nail the duality of a merciless criminal and devoted father in the way that Smith did.Smith's performance also gelled in incredible ways with Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, perhaps owing in part to Smith and Robbie's past work together in the filmFocus. Furthermore, Deadshot served as one of the main grounding points for the film, providing it with an emotional center it definitely otherwise lacked.Dr. Robert Neville (I Am Legend)Long beforeThe Walking Deadand other similar post-apocalyptic media were captivating audiences all around the world, Will Smith turned in one of his emotionally gripping and taxing roles as Dr. Robert Neville in the 2007 action dramaI Am Legend. Robert is one of the sole survivors of a virus that spread throughout humanity and wiped out the human race, turning them into monstrous, vampiric zombie creatures.In many ways, barring a few later scenes in the film,I Am Legendplays as a one-man film, which means the brunt of the weight of its success and emotional resonance rested on Smith's shoulders. And boy, did he deliver. His character's relationship with his ever-loyal dog, Sam, serves as the film's emotional center and allows Smith to show some of his truly underutilized dramatic acting chops.Mike Lowrey (Bad Boys)Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do? It was one of the first movies that really put Will Smith on the theatrical map, and it was also the franchise that introduced the world to Michael Bay's directorial skills.Bad Boys, first released in 1995, accomplished a lot for your average, run-of-the-mill action film.RELATED:Everything We Know (So Far) About Bad Boys For LifeBut thanks in large part to the buddy cop chemistry between Will Smith's Mike Lowrey and Martin Lawrence's Marcus Burnett, the film would go on to become so much more than just a one-off action film, spawning a series of films and spinoffs that is still ongoing. The third film in the franchise,Bad Boys for Life, is expected to be released in 2020.Alex “Hitch” Hitchens (Hitch)Will Smith may have made a real career out of his innate dramatic talents, but sometimes, he's really at his best when he gets back to his comedic roots. Look no further than the entirely over-the-top 2005 romantic comedyHitchfor the perfect example of that fact. Starring opposite Kevin James and Eva Mendes, Smith was pitch perfect in the role of Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, a love guru who prides himself on being able to teach even the most unlikely of men how to be romantic experts.There was nothing groundbreaking about this movie or the way it handled its clear Cyrano-esque material. But through Smith's comedic chops, and his adorable buddy rapport with a then up-and-coming James, the film still stands the test of time as to what a romantic comedy can be when romances, ironically, aren't the real focus.Chris Gardner (The Pursuit Of Happyness)Will Smith is comedically gifted, and certainly one hell of an action star. There's no denying either of those facts. But one of his best performances of all time—and one that earned him nominations for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe, to boot—came in the 2006 filmThe Pursuit of Happyness.The biopic, tear-jerking drama found Smith in the role of Chris Gardner, a hardworking father who struggles to raise his young son while trying to maintain a job and deal with being homeless for a year. One of the things that makes this film so truly compelling, beyond its inspirational and heart-rending narrative, is that Gardner's son was played in the film by Smith's own son, Jaden.Steven Hiller (Independence Day)And back we go again to Smith's considerable filmography in the action genre. This time, we're talking about the 1996 science fiction action thrillerIndependence Day, one of the highest grossing films of all time and perhaps the first true action blockbuster to take the world by storm during its summer of 1996 release.InIndependence Day, Smith shines among a cast of talented actors like Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum as Captain Steven Hiller, a young Marine tasked with saving the world from an impending alien invasion with only two days to do so before their planned attack on the 4th of July. Smith is truly riveting in this role, proving yet again that he's exactly the leading man that Hollywood needed at this time.Genie (Aladdin)When the live-action adaptation ofAladdinwas first announced, it was understandable that there was trepidation regarding how the character Genie would be handled. How could anyone possibly compare to the legendary Robin Williams, who produced one of the most beloved and iconic animated characters of all time in his voiceover work and endless improvisation material?RELATED:Aladdin Is Now The Highest Grossing Film Of Will Smith's CareerBut Disney found the perfect man for the job when they cast Will Smith in the role. Smith's take on Genie was decidedly his own: a character he rendered as many ways just as humorous as Williams' Genie, but also in many ways far more human and realistic, too.Agent J (Men In Black)Will Smith may have faced aliens in 1996'sIndependence Day, but that was only just the beginning for his career as an action hero opposite extraterrestrial visitors. Smith's involvement with the world of aliens only grew, and grew, and grew with the release of 1997'sMen in Black, the first film in a franchise that would find Smith reprising his role of Agent J opposite Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K in two additional films.More thanIndependence Day,Men in Blackfunctions not only as an action science fiction film but as a true comedy, too, allowing Smith to cover almost all of his bases in terms of his best skills in the acting world. Alongside Tommy Lee Jones, he also turns in yet another iconic buddy cop performance.Muhammad Ali (Ali)Smith may have been nominated for an Academy Award for his turn in the 2006 biopicThe Pursuit of Happyness, but that wasn't the first time a biography film would earn him that impressive honor. That distinction, in fact, goes to his performance as Muhammad Ali in the 2001 biopicAli.Smith was buoyed in the film by a truly incredible cast of actors, but on his own, Smith was already a true force of nature in his performance of the Greatest of All Time himself, Muhammad Ali. To prepare for the role, Smith approached it from an almost method actor stance, spending a year training for a boxer's life, and learning the intimate details of Ali's life and faith.Will Smith (The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air)Now, this is a story all about how his life got flipped, turned upside down. Will Smith's career really kicked off with the role of the same named character on the 1990-1996 iconic sitcomThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Even within the show, it's joked about multiple times how outrageous it seems for a series to be made based on the success of an up-and-coming rapper.But episode after episode, and season after season, Will Smith proved that he had more than what it took to be the leading man we all deserved, regardless of whether it was for comedy or drama. His character's development over the seasons, along with his total willingness to go along with any outlandish sitcom storylines, showed that Smith was able to deftly handle the nuances of character-driven dramas and over-the-top comedies.NEXT:The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air: 5 Best (& 5 Worst) EpisodesSubscribe to our newsletterShareTweetShareShareShareCopyEmailShareShareTweetShareShareShareCopyEmailLink copied to clipboardRelated TopicsListsAladdin (2019)Suicide Squad (2016)Men In BlackAbout The AuthorKaterina Daley(535 Articles Published)Katerina is a List Writer here at Screen Rant with a background in literary criticism and creative writing.

I don’t know why, really, because I don’t recall ever having a bad experience with them. Now, I can recall having very many great experiences with them – and a lot of fun.“When we were shooting a movie calledI Am Legend, I had to work closely with a German Shepherd called Abbey, who was playing the part of Sam, a young dog given to my character by my screen daughter who died in the story. So, Abbey and I spent a lot of time together. She was big and bouncy, but looked great, and I wanted to get close to her.“Abbey’s owner and trainer, Steve Berens, patiently introduced us and gave us confidence in each other. That was it! I was with her all the time and we became the best of friends. I liked having her around and when the movie production ended, I wanted to keep her. I was no longer nervous of any sort of dog and kind of fell in love with her. Steve was also attached to her, though, and so she stayed with him. He did say that we had bonded really well, which was nice to hear. It was the end of the movie, but the start of a different approach to dogs for me.”…Read the full interview by Bernard Bale in theFebruary issueTAGSFebruary issueGerman ShepherdInterviewRottweilerFacebookTwitterGoogle+PinterestWhatsAppPrevious article“Is it OK that I’ve never bathed my dog?”Next articleShih Tzu hoping 2020 will be his year to find a forever homeMaria LakenDog lover and animal welfare supporter, who has had previous experience in the magazine industry and has been writing for Dogs Monthly since 2018.

From top left:Karyn Parsons,Joseph Marcell,Janet Hubert-Whitten,Alfonso Ribeiro. From bottom left:Tatyana M. Ali,James Avery,Will Smith.In 1990, music managerBenny Medina, along with his business partner, real estate mogulJeff Pollack, decided to market a TV story based on Medina's life. Medina had grown up poor inEast Los Angelesbut his life changed when he befriended a rich white teenager, whose family lived inBeverly Hillsand allowed Medina to live with them. Medina decided to use this part of his life as the main focus of the show. However, given that by then a black character living with a white family was a concept that had been done multiple times on TV, Medina decided to change the rich white family to a rich black family. "That way we could explore black-on-black prejudice as well as black class differences", Medina said in an interview forEbonymagazine.[36]Medina pitched the idea toQuincy Jones, who had just signed a TV deal withTime-Warner. Jones was impressed by the idea and arranged a meeting withNBCchiefBrandon Tartikoff.Will Smithwas well known at the time as one-half of thehip-hopduoDJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, which had put him on the mainstream radar, but he had come into debt after failing to pay taxes. At the suggestion of his then-girlfriend, Smith went to a taping ofThe Arsenio Hall Showwhere he met Medina by chance. Medina pitched the idea to Smith, but Smith was reluctant, having never acted before. Medina invited Smith to meet Jones at a party that Jones was throwing at his house in December 1989. There, Jones handed Smith a script for a failedMorris Daypilot that he had produced and challenged Smith to audition for Tartikoff on the spot. Smith did so, and the first contract for the show was drawn up that night in a limo outside. Three months later, the pilot was shot.[37]Andy Borowitzand his wife,Susan, are credited as the series' creators. Andy Borowitz, who was on a contract with NBC, was selected by Tartikoff to write the pilot. He based Will's cousins on Quincy Jones's daughters, and named Carlton after his friendCarlton Cuse. In 2015, he remarked that "it was written and taped in about three weeks, start to finish, and somehow it worked. It was just an explosion of really good luck."[38]The pilot episode began taping on May 1, 1990.[39]Season 1 first aired in September 1990, and ended in May 1991. The series finale was taped on Thursday, March 21, 1996,[40][41]and aired on Monday, May 20, 1996.The theme song "Yo Home to Bel Air" was written and performed by Smith under his stage name,The Fresh Prince. The music was composed byQuincy Jones, who is credited with Smith at the end of each episode. The music often used to bridge scenes together during the show is based on a similar chord structure.Crossovers and other appearances[edit]During the fall 1991–1992 season, NBC gained two hit television shows to anchor their Monday night lineup (Blossomaired immediately afterThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air). To gain popularity between the two shows, Will Smith appeared in theBlossomepisode "I'm with the Band" as himself under his rapstage name,The Fresh Prince. That same season, Karyn Parsons appeared in theBlossomepisode "Wake Up Little Suzy" as Hilary Banks. Parsons also appeared in the Patti LaBelle sitcomOut All Nightas Hilary.James Avery had a short cameo as "the father from Fresh Prince" onFamily Matters, at the end of the episode "Scenes from a Mall". He appears during the credits in a blooper scene where he surprisesReginald VelJohnsonon set.[42]In the HouseandFresh Princewere both executive-produced by Winifred Hervey,David Salzmanand Quincy Jones. During the second season's first episode, Alfonso Ribeiro and Tatyana Ali appeared as theirFresh Princecharacters (Carlton and Ashley Banks) in the crossover episode "Dog Catchers". Later that season, James Avery (Phillip Banks) appeared as a mediator in the episode "Love on a One-Way Street".FollowingFresh Prince's conclusion, Ribeiro joined the principal cast ofIn the Housefrom its third season as Dr. Maxwell Stanton. In the Season 4 episode "My Pest Friend's Wedding", Avery and Daphne Maxwell Reid (the second Vivian Banks) guest starred as Stanton's parents. Joseph Marcell, Geoffrey Butler onFresh Prince, appeared as an officiating minister in the same episode.Syndication[edit]The series was produced byNBC Productionsin association with the Stuffed Dog Company andQuincy Jones Entertainment(laterQuincy Jones-David Salzman Entertainment in 1993). After the show was released to syndication in 1994, the series' distribution rights were picked up byWarner Bros. Television Distributionwho continue to hold them to this day, while NBCUniversal owns the series copyright via NBC Productions' successor-in-interest,Universal Television.[43][44][45][46]Currently, reruns of the series are still aired around the world onViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks'MTV2,BETandVH1, having previously been aired on itsMTV,Nick at Nite,TeenNick,CMT, andCentricchannels.

Ali1997Cultural impact and legacy[edit]The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's success is considered to be a watershed moment forhip-hopand black television,[60][61]with many publications referring to it as one of the greatest sitcoms of all time.[62][63]Professor Andrew Horton stated: "Smith's genre of comedy, popularized on the sitcomFresh Prince of Bel-Air, translated well into commercial box-office appeal.The Fresh Princewatered down and capitalized upon the then growing popularity of hip-hop and almost anticipated its dominance on the American scene".[64]Author Willie Tolliver noted: "WhatThe Fresh Princedid accomplish was to put Smith and his character Will into an environment of affluence and possibility, thus changing the terms of his own Black identity. This social and cultural mobility is central to Smith's racial significance, and this will become evident again and again; he moves the image of the Black male into unaccustomed spaces just as Smith himself was in the process of conquering Hollywood."[65]Reboot series[edit]Main article:Bel-Air (TV series)On August 13, 2015, it was reported that a reboot of the show was in development byOverbrook Entertainment, withWill Smithserving as a producer.[66][67]In August 2016, during a promotional interview with theE!television network for his then upcoming filmSuicide Squad, Smith denied that a reboot was in development, saying that it would happen "...pretty close to when Hell freezes over".[68]In 2019, a mock trailer titledBel-Airwas uploaded onYouTube, written and directed by Morgan Cooper, for a darker, more dramatic re-imagining of the sitcom.[69][70]Will Smith subsequently heavily praised the fan film, commenting that "Morgan did a ridiculous trailer forBel-Air. Brilliant idea, the dramatic version ofThe Fresh Princefor the next generation", expressing interest in expanding the idea beyond the short film into a fullBel-Airreboot series.[71][72]In August 2020, it was announced that Will Smith and Morgan Cooper would be developing a reboot of the series based on Cooper'sBel-Air. The series had reportedly been in the works for over a year since Cooper posted hisBel-Airtrailer on YouTube, withNetflix,PeacockandHBO Maxall currently bidding for the series.[73]On September 8, 2020, Peacock gaveBel-Aira two-season order, with the series produced by and copyrighted to Universal Television.[74][75]In September 2021, the full cast was announced with newcomer Jabari Banks cast as Will Smith,Adrian Holmesas Philip Banks,Cassandra Freemanas Vivian Banks,Olly Sholotanas Carlton Banks,Coco Jonesas Hilary Banks, Akira Akbar as Ashley Banks,Jimmy Akingbolaas Geoffrey, Jordan L. Jones as Jazz and Simone Joy Jones as Lisa.[76]The series premiered in February 2022.[77]Reunion[edit]Much of the cast virtually reunited over a video call in an episode of Smith'sSnapchatreality seriesWill From Homethat premiered in April 2020.[78]A reunion of the surviving original cast,The Fresh Prince Reunion, aired on HBO Max in November 2020. Among other reminisces, Janet Hubert appeared, also appearing around this time in a joint radio interview with Smith where the two reconcile.[79][80]More information and context were offered regarding the situation between Smith and Hubert and her exit when the two met for their conversation. Hubert discussed the turmoil in her personal life, her abusive marriage and that she had not actually been fired by the show. She was offered what she described as a "bad deal" to return for the fourth season and she turned it down. Smith talked about how grappling with his rapidly increasing fame at such a young age led him to make decisions during that time that he now regrets and wishes he had made differently.[81]The reunion show also features a tribute to James Avery, who died in 2013, that was shown to the surviving cast. The tribute brought the entire cast to tears.[82]Explanatory notes[edit]^Tied withHangin' with Mr. CooperandThe Jackie Thomas Show^Tied withDave's WorldReferences[edit]^"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air".TV.com.

In it, Smith lays bare painful family secrets, including a traumatic childhood incident involving his late father, Will Sr., that he says scarred him for years to come.Early in the book, Smith sets up the complicated relationship he had with his father William Carroll Smith Sr., who with his mother Caroline Bright, raised Smith and his three siblings in Philadelphia."My father was violent, but he was also at every game, play, and recital. He was an alcoholic, but he was sober at every premiere of every one of my movies," he writes. "He listened to every record. He visited every studio. The same intense perfectionism that terrorized his family put food on the table every night of my life."For more onWill Smith's memoir and other top stories, listen below toour daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day.Smith writes that a terrifying act of violence he witnessed his father carry out against his mother changed his life forever."When I was nine years old, I watched my father punch my mother in the side of the head so hard that she collapsed. I saw her spit blood. That moment in that bedroom, probably more than any other moment in my life, has defined who I am."Will Smith Shows Off Weight Loss Progress as He Works to Get in the 'Best Shape of My Life'For the actor, the trauma of that moment would impact his entire life and career. He explains, "Within everything that I have done since then — the awards and accolades, the spotlights and attention, the characters and the laughs — there has been a subtle string of apologies to my mother for my inaction that day. For failing her in the moment. For failing to stand up to my father. For being a coward."He continues, "What you have come to understand as "Will Smith," the alien-annihilating MC, the bigger-than-life movie star, is largely a construction – a carefully crafted and honed character – designed to protect myself. To hide myself from the world. To hide the coward."Smith's parents separated when he was a teen and divorced in 2000. Despite maintaining a close relationship with his father, the actor writes that his anger stemming from that childhood incident surfaced again decades later, while he cared for Will Sr., who had cancer.Never miss a story — sign up forPEOPLE's free weekly newsletterto get the biggest news of the week delivered to your inbox every Friday.RELATED VIDEO:Will SmithShows Off Weight Loss Progress as He Works to Get in the 'Best Shape of My Life'"One night, as I delicately wheeled him from his bedroom toward the bathroom, a darkness arose within me. The path between the two rooms goes past the top of the stairs. As a child I'd always told myself that I would one day avenge my mother. That when I was big enough, when I was strong enough, when I was no longer a coward, I would slay him."In that moment, Smith recalls entertaining the thought of killing his father. "I paused at the top of the stairs. I could shove him down, and easily get away with it," he writes. "As the decades of pain, anger, and resentment coursed then receded, I shook my head and proceeded to wheel Daddio to the bathroom."After Will Sr. died in 2016, Smith reflected on their turbulent relationship and what it taught him about finding true fulfillment."There is nothing that you can receive from the material world that will create inner peace or fulfillment," he writes. "In the end, it will not matter one single bit how well [people] loved you — you will only gain 'the Smile' based on how well you loved them."Related ArticlesWill Smith Recalls Last FaceTime with Dad Before His Death: 'We Got the Opportunity to Get Finished'Schizophrenia Caused Eric Smith to Threaten His Mother's Life, but He Refused to Get Help — Here's WhyPrince Harry Tells PEOPLE: 'Spare' Is a Raw Account of the 'Good, the Bad and Everything in Between'See All of the Celebrity Babies Born in 2020Prince Harry Drove Through Tunnel Where His Mother Died at Same Speed: 'I Want to Go Through It'Pamela Anderson Says Relationship with Tommy Lee May Have Been 'Only Time I Was Ever Truly in Love'First Look at Anne Heche Memoir Released After Her Death: How She Found Peace After Childhood Abuse'Monday Night Football' Alum Lisa Guerrero Reveals She Suffered Miscarriage on Live TV During a GamePrince Harry Claims King Charles Thanked Princess Diana for Giving Him a 'Spare' the Day He Was BornThe Biggest Revelations from Prince Harry's Book 'Spare'Prince Harry Asked to See Photos of Princess Diana's Car Crash: 'I Was Looking for Evidence...It Was True'Prince Harry Says U.K. Press Pitted Meghan Markle Against Kate Middleton: 'It Became Meghan Vs.

At least, that's been the excuse, although judging by the finished product, it was the script that never lived up to the promise of its premise."[97]Later that year, Smith had his second starring role in an animated film, inSpies in Disguise, oppositeTom Holland.

He is portrayed byWill Smith.Contents1Character2Story2.1Season 12.2Season 22.3Season 32.4Season 42.5Season 52.6Season 63Personality4Family5Likes and interests5.1SPORTS5.1.1WOMEN6Relationships7Trivia8PhotosCharacterWill is originally from West-Philadelphia but was forced to move soon after participating in a fight with a couple of thugs. Fearing for his safety hismothersent him out toBel Air. He was born in 1973 in West Philadelphia. When Will was five years old, he was abandoned by his father,Lou, leaving his mother,Viola, to raise him in poverty. At 16, a local bully namedOmarassaulted Will after he accidentally bounced a basketball on him. It is implied Omar's gang surrounds Will, and his friends criticize Will's stupidity, as well as mocking his full name - William - which Will takes offence to. They decide to start a fight with Will, but being raised in Philadelphia, Will feels as if he is tough enough to fight them. He doesn't back down, and his results in him getting beaten up by the four bullies. As he states in the intro, because of his loss - and by extension, the many dangers of living in a ghetto - Viola gives Will a ticket to Bel-Air, sending him off, and placing Will in the hands of his aunt, Vivian, and his uncle, Philip. After a plane ride and a taxi ride from Philadelphia to Bel-Air later, Will arrives at his new destination, eager to begin his new life in Bel-Air.StorySeason 1Vivian: Did you enjoy the flight?Will: Oh, the plane ride was stupid, man, I was all over first class like...Philip: Excuse me?Will: No, I said the plane was dope...Philip: EXCUSE ME?!Will's impression to his uncle Philip upon arrival.Will upon his arrival in Bel-Air.At arrival in the Bel-Air mansion, his rude and flippant attitude, as well as his overuse of slang terms shock his uncle, and while his aunt tries to stay neutral on the matter, it is made clear thatUncle Philipdoesn't appreciate his influence over his sheltered daughter,Ashley. Nonetheless, the whole family soon becomes fond of Will.Carlton(Smith's cousin) is introduced to him by Philip, Will himself jokingly responding that he does not remember who Carlton. Carlton is later made fun of all the time by Will because of his short size and preppy nature.They compete over many things, like impressing women in "Someday Your Prince Will Be In Effect" or basketball. Their relations together are at first sight, especially during a flashback of Will's first day at school, where his cousin attempts to get him fired because of his jealousy over Will. Carlton's relationship with Will is also highly indicative of the way they've been raised, as while Will has a life of hardship and poverty within a ghetto, Carlton was given a very sheltered and luxurious lifestyle, which Will intially considers to be superficial, and will often mock Carlton on account of him not being the idealized idea of a "tough black male."Later, Will gets homesick so to cheer him up, his AuntVivianinvites a friend over, named Ice Tray. The street-smart teenager still has trouble trying to adapt to the family's traditions, such as their strange way of celebrating Christmas.Also, Smith has trouble bonding with the Banks, except for Ashley. In "Knowledge is Power", Will blackmails his cousin, Hilary after hearing she dropped out of school without telling her parents. Will becomes friends with Jazz, whom he met in "Bang the Drum, Ashley".Will apparently spends most of his time hanging out with him and his other friends from Compton. The season ends with Hilary getting fond of Jazz (who has a crush on Hilary) after he defends her from mean insults of her boss, Merissa Redmond.Season 2Carlton:Will, everybody knows why you're in training. No fats, no chocolate, and no women.Will:Then, I should probably cancel my date with that fat chocolate woman.From - "My Brother's Keeper"Season 2 begins with Will revealing to the Banks that he plans on marrying his girlfriend, Catheline. However, after an earthquake jams the door of the basement they were in, Will finds out in horror that his girlfriend used fake nails, a wig, and other accessories to look nice. Smith is disgusted and they decide to break up. Later, Ashley confides to Will that a girl keeps bullying her at school. After that, when Will asks for $200 for the Homecoming Party, Philip says that he'll accept despite the large sum because he thinks of Will as his own son. Will thinks about what his uncle said and realizes that he's turning soft, becoming more and more like Carlton, so he gets a job as a waiter at Treasure Island to earn the money like a man.The competition between Carlton and his cousin doesn't stop, especially after Will shows great intelligence after beating Carlton in his PSAT scores. This season shows Will's gambling skills, as he rakes in $1000 in a charity casino, but also his greed when he wants to keep the money after being told that he was supposed to donate it for charity. At the season's end, Carlton bonds more with Will when they both get into trouble for pawning Vivian's bracelet for money. Having lost all $400, they decide to attend a job as stripteasers, but get caught by Vivian, and grounded by Philip. The two go back to the pawnshop to get the bracelet back, but it's too late unless they make a deal -- a dance.Season 3Will: [toCarlton] Do I detect a little hostility? You owe me some flowers, mister.From - "The Alma Matter"Season 3 begins with Will returning from Philly after spending his summer there. However, things start to go bad when he comes home with an annoying beeper, a bad hairstyle, and a jail suit. Later on, school starts and Will is excited about Bel-Air Academy going co-ed and getting to see all the hot girls, however, he and Carlton are not too happy to see Ashley like this and forces her to change.Later, Smith's relationship with Jazz hits an all-time low when Jazz gets him arrested for a series of unpaid parking tickets, and Will decides to break up with him, but the two became friends again when they realize that Will is going to college. Near the latter half of the season, Will gets accepted into Princeton, which makes Carlton extremely jealous, as he envies Will's natural charisma and sociability. Evidently, striving to one up Will - thinking he will be perceived as superior to Will by not only imitating him, but getting better marks on his report card in - Carlton decides to act like Will during his interview at Princeton, but things go south, and Carlton goes low enough to threaten his interviewer for Princeton with death threats, as well as proposing that he pimp out Hilary for the man, which gets him rejected and suspended from school. During the season finale, the graduation is soon approaching, and Will finds himself in a deep hole. He must make up a total of ten hours of music class or he won't graduate, and even worse, well for him, he must sing in front of everybody at graduation while on stage with little kids in sunflower costumes. Although the week is tough, Will does inevitably make it through this trying experience, walking with his friends out at graduation.Season 4Carlton:Will, I met the woman of my dreams.Will:Word? I ain't know RuPaul lived in L.A.From - "Where There's a Will, There's a Way (Part 1)"This season begins with Will and Carlton ready to move into their own college apartment, but Philip isn't too happy about this. Not helping Philip's possessive viewpoint of his children is Hilary announcing that she and Trevor are getting married, which causes him to think he's losing his family. However, Jazz gets Will and Carlton evicted from their apartment for throwing a wild party - which neither Will or Carlton appreciate. Carlton decides that he belongs home anyway and moves back in. Meanwhile, Will confronts Jazz for getting them kicked out of their crib and asks for the money. At the end of the second part of "Where There's a Will, There's a Way", Hilary loses her fiance in a bungee jump, and while in deep mourning, Will convinces her that the pool house will keep reminding her of Trevor and she moves out. Will requests Philip for the pool house, and he lets him stay there, with the same rent Hilary was paying.Throughout the first half of this season, Will's relationship with his old friend from Philadelphia, Jackie (Tyra Banks), is primarily showcased, and their dynamic is a large focus in the nine episode Jackie makes an appearance in. Near the end of the season, Will's father shows up after 14 years of abandonment. Will is initially skeptical of his father at first, but eventually warms up to the idea of his father, Lou, being back in his life again. Going along with, or likely, feigning interest in Will's idea, Lou promises Will to take him on the road with him for the summer. However, Uncle Phil thinks this is a big mistake and - knowing full well who Lou is and what he has done to Will - is fully aware that Will will likely end up getting hurt by his father again. Will gets defensive about Lou, telling Uncle Phil that Lou "made a mistake", and gets mad at him for disrespecting his father. Near the end of that episode, Will makes up with Philip after what they said to each other.At the end of the episode, Lou chooses to abandon Will again when he makes a deal with a trucker to get an "easy" $500. Will is crushed by this news. Being a "tough guy" from West Philadelphia, he tries to shrug what his father has done to him off under a bravado of coolness and indifference. However, Uncle Phil sees through this act, telling Will that it is alright to be angry about what his father did to him. That episode ends with him crying on his uncle's shoulders - his uncle showing him the same fatherly love he always wanted his father to show him.At the end of the season, Will and his family all visit his hometown, West Philadelphia. While he's there, he goes to Duke's Cheesesteaks with Hilary, Carlton, and Ashley, and when he is recognized by other people in the restaurant, they begin to tease him for running away from a fight a long time ago. In the end, however, he decides to stay with his mother some more because he misses Philly, and then he suddenly has no intention returning back to Bel-Air at all and tells his uncle that he's not coming back.Season 5Will:Yo, Bellhop! If the room be bopping, don't you be knocking!From - "For Whom the Wedding Bells Toll"This season picks up after the last season and starts off with Will working at Duke's House of Cheesesteaks. Will states that he misses his family in Bel-Air, but time moves on. Things are going fine for Will until an NBC executive takes Will back to Bel-Air in a van called the "Star Retrieval Unit". After that, the first episode quickly centers around Will discovering Ashley's musical talent and becoming her manager.Later on, Will meetsLisa Wilkes, who have a strong relationship, so strong that makes Will give up his "chicktionary" to Carlton, stating that he's a one-woman man. Their relationship goes a step further when Will proposes to Lisa in a hospital. In the end, Will and Lisa have their wedding. Will discovers that there are some things about Lisa that he doesn't know about such as her favorite food, favorite movie, and even her name. However, Will learns that Lisa also has doubts about their marriage and decides that they're going to be good together. On the other hand, Lisa doesn't want to marry him, which shocks everyone. They both think they're moving too fast and should get married. However, Fred suddenly proposes to Vy, much to Will's dismay. Will gives them their bouquet and the two get married. Will is no longer a one-woman man.Season 6This season starts with Will lying down on the couch bored because of nothing to do during the summer and because Carlton is away at Young Republican's Camp. When he sees Geoffrey and Hilary preparing flam-be, he gets interested and wants to try it, but Geoffrey tells him to get out. After they leave, Will starts playing with it but ends up burning the kitchen down.PersonalityAt the start of the show, Will is characterized as a street smart, laidback, smart-mouthed, and immature teenager. Being born and raised inWest Philadelphia, he is naturally a very mischievous, rebellious, and very stubborn to the beliefs he carries as a result of his upbringing. Often, Will teases his cousin,Carltonbecause he doesn't consider him "black", as well as for being shorter than him. For the most part, Will is a suave, charismatic young man, and is shown to be quite childish, crafty, and often self-absorbed throughout the show. Although he's been shown on numerous occasions to be just as intelligent as Carlton (examples of this being when he gets a higher score on PSAT than Carlton, or solving a rubix cube leading a Princeton recruiter to consider recommending him), he's often lazy academically, barely passing by high school, and seemingly more interested his own personal pleasures than his academic studies. Contrarily enough, Will himself states that he used to be quite indulged in studying back in Philadelphia, which does imply that Will's hardened mindset from being raised in such a crime infested and harsh environment sharpened his disdain for studying - as such things, as stated by Will, got him and his friends chased. He even suggests he may not have made it out of those situations if he hadn't been protected by his friends. Initially, Will also tries to distance himself from his uncle and cousins because he finds them snobbish and superficial. However, contrasting this, is after this scene, where Will shows a sense of humility when Uncle Phil calls him out for this misconception, stating that Will should use his intellect before he fully judges someone.Another part of Will's personality is his sense of masculinity. Will has demonstrated on many occasions to be concerned about being perceived as proud, confident, and manly. Because of the fact that he was raised in West Philadelphia, he is quite tough, and always tries to act like the bigger man when opposed - directly or indirectly. However, it is also this tough nature that is also his downfall, as most of the time, he responds to threats saying "you wanna take thisoutside" - no matter who the opposition may be. His overconfidence may also get the better of him as well in some situations, as his mocking of and underestimating of his opponents doesn't help with his occasionally short tempered outbursts. He also tends to have a sense of cowardice when challenged, and will often try to weasel his way out of a fight using his street smarts and charisma, most of the time running his mouth and biting off more than he can chew in these situations. This, coupled with his afforementioned tough talk, is what often leads him into trouble. Surprisingly enough, while he will often use his sneaky and crafty nature to avoid fights, often barking far harder than he can bite, it is also shown that he, on occasion, is actually quite strong beyond his tough talk. One notable example of his strength is seen when he fist-fights a loaded gunmen whom, while Will believed it to be a ruse, did intend to rob the place with the intent to rob - and kill, if necessary. However, while he can be quick to anger, as well as quick to having outbursts, he is also quite relaxed most of the time, and despite maturing throughout the shows run, he doesn't seem to lose his laidback, carefree attitude. Will is also a lot more goofy, caring, and sweet than he lets on as well, although he usually tends to overcompensate for this under a very confident and manly bravado. An example of this is in Season 5, Episode 10, as when asked to describe Will in one word, Lisa calls him goofy, which he takes great bother to. Will also seems to have an unrealistic sense of manliness, and his overconfident, careless, and tough-guy facade more than likely a result of being raised in the rough neighbourhood of Philadelphia.Will is also characterized by his sarcastic, referential, and witty sense of humour, which he often uses to lighten a situation, or make a humorous remark at someone's expense, and is never without a humorous response. Although, despite his immaturity and remarks at his families' expense, Will is also a genuinely kind, sometimes emotional, and very caring and loyal person. He tends to be well intentioned, and while his attempts to come off like the bigger man may come at the cost people's expense, this is usually a result of a lack of parental supervision, as well as tying back to the mentality he was raised with on the streets, rather than any genuine malice on his part.While he may act laidback, careless, or dismissive of individuals such as Carlton, he's also perceived by his peers as a very charismatic, confident, and typically "cool" person. He is seen to make connections easily, and his laidback and kind nature does lead itself well to forming genuine connections. As seen in the multiple episodes set in Bel-Air Academy, Will is perceived to be very admirable, and is commonly invited to hang out with his peers - people even going as far as to mimic is "reversed" school blazer, which they similarly find to be cool. Supporting this, is the fact that he's shown to be quite accepting of people as well, demonstrated by his very close to his little cousin,Ashley, who he feels understands him more than any other of the Banks. Although running his mouth, and joking at the cost of his families' patience, deep down, he truly does care about his relatives, and is very generous for them accepting him into their home. Even as early as Season 1, Will seems to maintain a strong sense of loyalty towards his closest companions, as well as his mother. Furthermore, he has shown to be more than willing to defend, stand up for, and protect his family when the chips are down - even at the expense of himself, or his own street credit, which is saying a lot, especially from someone as flippant as Will. Additionally, Will is a lot more sensitive than he lets on. He is often seen crying (usually in a humours manner), or overreacting when he is challenged, or his feelings are hurt. Although he can play off as if he is indifferent, which is often times an attempt to maintain his sense of manliness, he is not above bursting into tears when deeply wounded. This is best demonstrated throughout the many times he snaps when someone insults his mother, whom he is fiercely protective of. When his cousins blame him onsomeone's death, he whimpers and falls to the ground - clearly feeling responsible for the death that he arguably didn't cause. The most glaring example is in Season 4, Episode 24 when - despite trying to hide it under a veneer of carelessness and humour - he breaks down and cries into his uncle's arms when his father leaves him, showing that behind his "tough man" mentality, he is quite an emotional man.While he often behaves as if he is laidback and disinterested, he has also shown to want be very caring, and a sort of brotherly figure to the younger of the Banks children. More specifically, while he sometimes perceivesPhilipas being overprotective ofAshley, he, himself, can also be this way. For example, when Ashley asked Will about sex for the first time, he freaked out and said haphazardly told her that "she needed a license." Another example of his overprotective nature is in Season 6 Episode 7 when he accidentally eavesdrops on his cousin and her friends about losing her virginity. His first response is to warn her, and he does, which leads her to get furious - saying it's her life, and she can do what she wants with it. In Season 5 Episode 14, he freaks out when he catches Ashley at a party with college boys and immediately drags her home, before yelling at her, warning her about the dangers of underage and unprotected sex.FamilyWill is the only child ofLouandVy Smith.Will's father,Louabandoned Vy and five-year-old Will. He reappears in "Papa's Got a Brand New Excuse". Will first sees his father after 14 years in The Peacock Shop, freaking him out with his staring (before recognizing him as his father, Will discretely called Carlton and tells him he thinks Lou's a cop). Lou explains to Will that he works as a trucker now and has been in touch with Vy, who told him where Will was.At first, Will is reluctant of giving Lou a chance, but after an afternoon hanging out at a carnival, and after Lou explains to Will that he wasn't prepared to be a father, Will gives in to his joy of having his father around. The two of them discuss going on a road trip to Maine. However, Lou is given an assignment and ditches Will again, for the last time.This causes an angry and hurt Will to denounce Lou as his father and to rant at Phillip, eventually asking Phillip "How come he don't want me, man?" and bursting into tears, which causes an emotional Phil to comfort him with a hug.Lou seemed disheartened when Will rejected him as his father, but as he left, he seemed to think nothing of it.Viola "Vy" Smithis Will's loving mother. They are both protective of one another and she is very proud of her son. She also keeps him in line and doesn't let him forget the manners she brought him up with. She is quite rude to everyone else, especially when her sister, Janice decided to marry a white man. She works as a supervisor at the post office.Carlton Banksis Will's cousin who he often teases over his short stature and not being "black" enough. Though their bickering is a common theme in the series, Carlton and Will share a close, brother-like relationship and Will is quick to defend Carlton against anyone who puts him down (For example, he is prepared to fightTop Dogin "Blood is Thicker Than Mud" when Top Dog refuses to allow Carlton into the fraternity for being a sellout.) Will and Carlton are best friends. Will also took a bullet for him, during a robbery.Hilary Banksis the spoiled, pretty, and simple-minded cousin of Will. She is known for her dependence on the family's butler, Geoffrey Barbara, her poor housing skills (she doesn't know how to toast bread), and her passion for shopping. Although she's very self-centered, she gets along better with Will than Carlton.Ashley "KFC" Banksis Will's little cousin. She has great admiration for Will, calling him "the brother she never had" (she makes fun of Carlton's girly habits). Over the years, she loses her interest over her cousin, especially when he starts getting overprotective but still remains close to him because he is looking out for her. Unlike Phillip, Will apologizes and very understanding. She has many talents, such as a formidable singing voice and dazzling beauty.Nicky Banksis the Banks family's youngest member. Will refers to him as "little man". He shares the same interests as Will, like basketball, and seems to like Will more than any other member of the family.Philip Banksis Will's overweight and short-fused marital uncle. He thinks of Will as "desperate" and refers to him to others as his "nephew by marriage". Will often gets Philip in trouble. Despite Philip being ashamed of Will's attitude, he considers him one of his own. This is made clear in "Papa's Got A Brand New Excuse", when Phillip tries to warn Will against trusting Lou again, and when Phillip is shown being clearly hurt after Will yells at him that Phil's not his father and, therefore, cannot keep him from going on a summer road trip with Lou. However, after Lou abandons Will again, Will began to see Philip as his true father figure.  Even though they initially didn't get along in the earlier seasons most notably Philip ranting about wanting Will to leave, He eventually warmed up to Will becoming part of the family, becoming a true father figure and even telling him "You are My Son, Will, End of Story".Vivian Banksis Will's forthright aunt who seems to care about Will a lot. She would often take Will's side in some situations like when he tells her and his uncle he got a job.Fred Wilkesis Will's stepfather. He is the overprotective father of Lisa, the girl whom Will dating in Season 5. Though he has been hostile toward other boys who've dated Lisa, Fred took an instant liking to Will and saw him as the son he always wanted. At the end of season 5, Fred married Will's mother Vy after Will and Lisa decided not to get married. Will and Fred shared a strong father-son bond as opposed to Will's biological father Lou who abandoned him as a child because of his unwillingness to accept responsibility.Lisa Wilkesis Will's stepsister. Throughout season 5, she and Will were dating. They both loved each other dearly and during the middle of season 5, Will proposed to her. After some reluctance, she accepted. However, in the end, she and Will decide they were too young to get married and they were rushing too fast. They call off the wedding, giving her father Fred a chance to propose to Will's mom Vy. She accepts and the two get married, making Will and Lisa stepbrother and stepsister.Likes and interestsSPORTSAlthough decent in all sports, Will is arguably the best at basketball. Will played basketball since he was very little. In "Papa's Got A Brand New Excuse", Will states that he learned basketball alone without any help. In a two against two games againstCarlton, he defeated him 21 to 18, with the fact that Carlton was given an 18 points head start. While the show doesn't go as far as to say he's going to get a CAREER in the sport, it is known he is very good - and much better than many people his age, although it is unknown how much of his skill can be attributed to his height.In "Courting Disaster", Will wants to find a spot to play basketball, so goes withJazzat school to play in the gymnasium. Coach Smiley as he dunks a basketball, amazing the hopeless school team. He offers Will to participate, to which he initially declines, but accepts later. In Will's first game, he singlehandedly destroys the opposing team 64 to 21, making Carlton jealous of his success.In "My Brother's Keeper", he plays a game against Malibu, with their star playerMarcus. Seeing that Marcus has a son to feed, Will lets past a lay-up from him and Malibu wins the game 91 to 90. Marcus later asks why Will let his team win, and he explains that he's got to make a living raising his son. Marcus tells Will that basketball isn't going to feed his family, but school studies will. They become friends at the end of the episode.WOMENThroughout the show, Will is, like many young men his age, depicted to be a very sexually interested and flirtatious individual. As with his jokes, when Will is in the presence of women he personally finds attractive, he is never without a cheesy romantic one-liner. He finds women very physically attractive, and is often seen joking about, flirting with, looking at, or even making love with many women throughout the series. He is also usually seen with a new women per episode until Season 5, where he finally settles down and commits to a relationship with Lisa Wilkes  However, while he is perceived to be charming by many women, he is also commonly rejected by women who dismiss him as desperate. As far as the extent of his interest goes, he is shown to be a very stubborn perverted individual who will go to great lengths to get with women - even to the point of breaking certain legal boundaries to get what he wants - although, this is more a result of his rebellious and stubborn attitude rather than any genuine malice on his part. This is best represented in Season 3, Episode 17, "Best Laid Plans", where Will is seen going as far as to fake a marriage with the intention of having sex with a girl who has been raised to not have sex before marriage. It should be noted that even he was unwilling to go as far as to actually make love to her, and even when discussing his actions with her, is shown to be genuinely regretful of his actions.RelationshipsMelinda ("Someday Your Prince Will Be in Effect (Parts 1and2)")Helen ("Kiss My Butler")Cindy ("Someday Your Prince Will Be in Effect (Parts 1 and 2)")Lisa Wilkes(Season 5)Jackie (Season 4)Monique ("Best Laid Plans")Mimi Mumford ("Clubba Hubba")Candance ("Father of the Year")Cathline ("Did the Earth Move for You?")Valerie ("Grumpy Young Men")Denise ("Cold Feet, Hot Body")Helena ("Boxing Helena")Michelle Michaels ("When You Hit Upon a Star")Christina ("Def Poet's Society")Paula ("The Cold War")Dee Dee ("She Ain't Heavy")Veronica ("That's No Lady, That's My Cousin")Cindy ("Just Say Yo")Janet ("It Had to Be You")Kayla Samuels ("Love at First Fight")Wendy ("M is for the Many Things She Gave Me")Janice Robertson ("M is for the Many Things She Gave Me")TriviaAlthough the character is named William Smith, in real life, Will Smith's full name is Willard.Will Smith chose his own name for the character as he didn't want to be typecast in which people would approach him and call him by his character name, much like Alfonso Ribiero experiences now (ironically RIbiero suggested Will use his own name).The character was the actor's break-out role and is well known.A running gag is that the Banks kids, Philip and Vivian often blame Will for their trouble, a lot of events are not caused by him. Eventually, Will realized this by stating that was the family motto “When in doubt blame Will” and soon told his family to stop blaming him.He,Carlton BanksandHilary Banksare the only main characters to be in every episodes.PhotosWill Smith/GalleryCategoriesCategories:CharactersMain CharactersCommunity content is available underCC-BY-SAunless otherwise noted.AdvertisementFan FeedMore The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air1Frederick Vickers2Lisa Wilkes3Jackie AmesExplore WikisUniversal Conquest WikiLet's Go Luna!

The night Will Smith went to meet Jada Pinkett, he met his first wife instead. Here’s how they finally got together. - The Washington PostAccessibility statementSkip to main contentSearch NavigationDemocracy Dies in DarknessSign inThis article was published more than4yearsagoThe Washington PostDemocracy Dies in DarknessRelationshipsThe night Will Smith went to meet Jada Pinkett, he met his first wife instead. Here’s how they finally got together.ByLisa BonosOctober 24, 2018 at 1:12 p.m. EDTFrom left: Adrienne Banfield-Jones, Jada Pinkett Smith, Will Smith and Willow Smith. (Stan Evans / Red Table Talk/Stan Evans)Comment on this storyCommentGiftArticleShareSome of the best relationships do not proceed directly from meet-cute to togetherness. Rather, they meander, as Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith’s relationship has. This week, Will was the guest on “Red Table Talk,” Jada’s Facebook Watch talk show, and the two dished all about their relationship, with their daughter, Willow, and Jada’s mother, Adrienne Banfield-Jones, chiming in. Here are some of the biggest twists and turns in their relationship.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightInstead of a meet-cute, they had several ‘near-misses’When Will saw Jada on “A Different World,” he knew had to meet her. “I knew there was something in our energy that would be magic,” Will recalls more than 20 years later. But the night Will and his “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” co-star Alfonso Ribeiro went to a taping of “A Different World,” expressly to meet Jada … Will instead ended up meeting Sheree Zampino, whom he proceeded to date and marry. Will and Jada had several “near-misses,” but when they did finally meet and talk during a gathering at an L.A. jazz club, Smith realized that initial spark he’d had about Jada was spot-on.AdvertisementBut he was married and didn’t believe in divorce, he said. So he didn’t act on that attraction, even though it had a powerful effect on him, driving Will to break down in tears in a restaurant bathroom while at dinner with Zampino. “I had a realization I wasn’t with the person I was supposed to be with,” Will said on the “Red Table.” In telling this story, Jada turned to the camera and said point-blank: “We did not have an affair while he was married. Let’s be clear about that.” Only once Zampino decided to divorce Will did he and Jada start dating.Becoming Mr. & Mrs. Smith (Part 1)Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith reveal the truth behind their relationship, from the day they met to the moments of crisis in their 20-plus year marriage.Posted byRed Table Talkon Monday, October 22, 2018Jada dropped everything to move across the country to be with WillWill recalls that, after his breakup with Zampino, he called Jada, who had just bought a farm in Baltimore, and asked her: “Are you seeing anybody?” When she said no, Will said: “Cool. You’re seeing me now.” She reflects now on how she was “dumb” to pick up and move to Southern California, having not even spent one night in the house she bought for herself, but also believes that it was the right move.Advertisement‘It was a horrible wedding’About two years into dating, Jada got pregnant. She didn’t want to get married or have a wedding, she said, but her mom, Banfield-Jones, wanted them to have a wedding. “I’m sorry I didn’t respect your wishes,” Banfield-Jones said on “Red Table Talk.” She just wanted that experience of being at her daughter’s wedding.However, the wedding itself was “horrible,” Jada says. She was three months pregnant and wasn’t feeling well. Viewers can see that discomfort on Jada’s face in the wedding photos shown in this part of the episode. “I went crying down the freaking aisle, getting married,” she recalled.It wasn’t the commitment of marriage that Jada was against, she said, but rather all the conventional ideas of what a “wife” should be that didn’t feel right. Will, on the other hand, always imagined himself getting married and says that being married makes him a better man.AdvertisementEarly in their marriage, one fight made them commit to being better communicatorsWill remembers a party they’d had during which Jada cursed at him while he had his young son Trey on his lap. Will proceeded to hit his wife with a newspaper and take her aside in the other room to talk. “Jada, this is the deal,” he said to her. “I grew up in a household where I watched my father punch my mother in the face — and I will not create a house, a space, an interaction with a person where there’s profanity and violence. If you have to talk to me like that, we can’t be together.”So they decided then and there that they wouldn’t communicate while angry — they would get their anger out privately and then come back, calm and collected, and settle their arguments without yelling or cursing. They’ve taken communication classes, Will said, and that practice has seemed to pay off. “It was 20 years before we used profanity in any conversation that we had,” Will said.AdvertisementThis part of the episode was extremely instructive and can translate to viewers' relationships, as learning how to argue effectively with your significant otheris a skill that takes practice. And Will and Jada are candid about just how much work it takes to fight without getting stuck in the anger. Will said he now has stock phrases that he uses when he’s too angry to talk. He’ll say something like: “I’m impaired. I can’t be loving right now. I can’t be kind right now. So you have to let me go. When I come back, I will come back in a way that is the way you deserve me to be.”‘Externally, our family was winning,’ Will says. But at home, Jada was having a hard time.Will remembers a time when everyone in the family seemed to be doing well in the outside world: Jada was starring in the medical drama “Hawthorne;” Willow’s single “Whip My Hair” was doing well; Will and Jada co-hosted the Nobel Peace Prize Concert. But at home, Jada was waking up and crying every day.AdvertisementIn the video, she talks about the difficulty of staying home to raise kids while Will’s life was barely disrupted. They had different ideas of what made a good relationship, and when she turned 40, Jada said: “I can’t do this like this anymore.” What changes did that realization prompt? We’ll find out on the next episode of “Red Table Talk.”READ MORE:Lovers have been ghosting each other for centuries. Here’s 5 of history’s worst breakups.In ‘A Star Is Born,’ Ally stays with Jack.

Opinions vary.

(Above: Chicago Cubs Neifi Perez (13) on base in the fifth inning against the San Diego Padres on Sunday, May 14, 2006.)(Chicago Tribune file photo by José M. Osorio)Do you have a lucky number? If you are a perfectly rational person, yet you continue to buck statistics and gravitate toward certain digits, you aren't alone."People have been doing this for centuries," said B. Sidney Smith, a mathematician and founder of the website PlatonicRealms.com. "Numbers underlying reality is an ancient tradition that pops up in all civilizations historically." He cited Pythagoras, the Greek philospher and mathematician whose theories are still used today.Advertisement"Once Western civilization became a faith-based society, numbers had this mystical tinge and it became a dangerous thing, like it was secret and naughty," he said. "My degree is in mathematical logic, so I'm a doctor of rationality. (Believing in lucky numbers) has nothing to do with mathematics, which is all logic and reasoning — but that doesn't make it any less beautiful or interesting."Smith thinks it's simply another way to find meaning through life's many uncertainties.AdvertisementWe asked our readers if they believe in lucky numbers — here were some of their responses"The number that follows me is 11," wrote Adam."During a critical juncture in my life I looked at a bank clock and it was 11:11 and 11 seconds. It was a moment of epiphany for me. Now I always look at the clock at 11:11, see 1111 on license plates, addresses, dates. … For me it represents change, growth, and a reminder of where I have come from."Kim also feels 11 is her lucky number. "What could be better than two ones and better than a 10?" she wrote. "It was my jersey number for soccer too.""I had a party on 11/11/11 and I took my college loan out on 8/8/88," wrote Heather. "My favorite number of all time is and will always be five! I will be on high alert this Friday for sure.""‎The number 17 has followed me forever," wrote Andrew. "Back in 1987, I was 17 and everything in my life seemed to work out perfectly. Never had a year like that ever since.""My lucky number is ‎nine," wrote John. "Ever since I saw it on Randy Hundley's Cubs jersey in 1969. I'm always on the look out for it.""Lucky number is seven for me," wrote Alison. "It's in my original home address and twice in our phone number. And it was my dad's lucky number. I have it on my license plate now.""There is the Jewish tradition of offering gifts and donations in multiples of 18," wrote Jodi. "That number corresponds alphabetically with 'chai' in Hebrew, which means 'life.' "Advertisement"Was born on the 13th and it's always been my favorite number," wrote Diane. "Tried to get married on the 13th but it was a Sunday. We always celebrate Friday the 13th. My husband surprised me with tickets to a show this Friday.""I went into labor on a Friday the 13th," wrote Nora.

Opinions vary.

(Above: Chicago Cubs Neifi Perez (13) on base in the fifth inning against the San Diego Padres on Sunday, May 14, 2006.)(Chicago Tribune file photo by José M. Osorio)Do you have a lucky number? If you are a perfectly rational person, yet you continue to buck statistics and gravitate toward certain digits, you aren't alone."People have been doing this for centuries," said B. Sidney Smith, a mathematician and founder of the website PlatonicRealms.com. "Numbers underlying reality is an ancient tradition that pops up in all civilizations historically." He cited Pythagoras, the Greek philospher and mathematician whose theories are still used today.Advertisement"Once Western civilization became a faith-based society, numbers had this mystical tinge and it became a dangerous thing, like it was secret and naughty," he said. "My degree is in mathematical logic, so I'm a doctor of rationality. (Believing in lucky numbers) has nothing to do with mathematics, which is all logic and reasoning — but that doesn't make it any less beautiful or interesting."Smith thinks it's simply another way to find meaning through life's many uncertainties.AdvertisementWe asked our readers if they believe in lucky numbers — here were some of their responses"The number that follows me is 11," wrote Adam."During a critical juncture in my life I looked at a bank clock and it was 11:11 and 11 seconds. It was a moment of epiphany for me. Now I always look at the clock at 11:11, see 1111 on license plates, addresses, dates. … For me it represents change, growth, and a reminder of where I have come from."Kim also feels 11 is her lucky number. "What could be better than two ones and better than a 10?" she wrote. "It was my jersey number for soccer too.""I had a party on 11/11/11 and I took my college loan out on 8/8/88," wrote Heather. "My favorite number of all time is and will always be five! I will be on high alert this Friday for sure.""‎The number 17 has followed me forever," wrote Andrew. "Back in 1987, I was 17 and everything in my life seemed to work out perfectly. Never had a year like that ever since.""My lucky number is ‎nine," wrote John. "Ever since I saw it on Randy Hundley's Cubs jersey in 1969. I'm always on the look out for it.""Lucky number is seven for me," wrote Alison. "It's in my original home address and twice in our phone number. And it was my dad's lucky number. I have it on my license plate now.""There is the Jewish tradition of offering gifts and donations in multiples of 18," wrote Jodi. "That number corresponds alphabetically with 'chai' in Hebrew, which means 'life.' "Advertisement"Was born on the 13th and it's always been my favorite number," wrote Diane. "Tried to get married on the 13th but it was a Sunday. We always celebrate Friday the 13th. My husband surprised me with tickets to a show this Friday.""I went into labor on a Friday the 13th," wrote Nora. "Myself and every maternity ward staffer made sure the baby came on the 14th."Michelle wrote, "I don't necessarily have a lucky number, but have always had good things happen to me on Friday the 13th.
