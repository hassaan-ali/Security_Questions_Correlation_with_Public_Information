I wish there was a way to get nutrients without sitting down for a meal.
As the main staples Elon s diet consisted of hot dogs oranges pasta and green peppers.
Because I have a great deal of respect for Elon and his ability to create I wanted to see if I could complete his challenge of living on one dollar a day.To be as accurate as possible I researched the inflation rate from when Elon was 17 years old until now.It turns out one dollar in 1989 would be the equivalent of about 2.20 today.
I decided to round up to two dollars a day for this challenge to see if I could do it.My regular diet compared to Elon s dietMy usual routine consists of three meals a day.
I usually have a breakfast bar and coffee in the morning.Lunch is made with either chicken or steak for protein complimented with grains and a mixed salad.
Dinner also involves animal protein and a couple of vegetable sides.Needless to say mynormal dietis much more than 2 per day so I knew it would be a challenge to restrict my spending by that much.
At two dollars per day I would need to feed myself for seven days for 14.00 or less.My breakfast for a weekI am perfectly content eating the same thing every day so I planned my week ahead of time.I bought 18 eggs for 2.00 and ate two each morning 0.29 per morning for seven days .I also purchased a five pound bag of brown rice for 3.38.
I split this into seven servings 0.48 per serving and ate one serving for breakfast.The total cost of breakfast for the week 5.38My lunch for a weekFor lunch I made Rotini pasta.
I purchased two boxes of Walmart brand Garden Rotini in the 16 ounce box for 1.00 each.I split the 32 ounces into seven servings for lunch 0.28 per day .
I also purchased generic 24 ounce pasta sauce for 1.50 and split it over my lunch pasta 0.21 per day .For a side I purchased a three pound bag of mandarin oranges for 3.00 and split them evenly into 14 sides.
I used them for lunch and dinner 0.21 per day .The total cost of lunch for the week 4.90My dinner for a weekI went with the eight pack of Bar S jumbo hot dogs for 1.16.
I also purchased an eight pack of whole wheat hot dog buns for 0.87.I did cheat here because I did not have enough money for ketchup so I used some I already had in the refrigerator.I ate the mandarin oranges as a dinner side which equaled 0.21 each night.The total cost of dinner for the week 3.50My total cost of food for the week After adding it all up I spent a total of 13.87 on food for the week.
His normal routine today consists of coffee in the morning and a small lunch he can eat in five minutes or less.His dinner choices usually involve one of his favorite dishes which include French cuisine or American barbeque.Elon no longer watches what he eats and onlyexercisesone to two times a week.
For a man who is so busy it seems like food still gets in the way of his progress.More DietElon MuskExerciseHow ToMorning RoutineSuccessful HabitsLadders PressMore from LaddersThe simple eye contact trick you should use in every conversation I got a job with Apply4Me Be a good boss to yourself 2023Ladders Inc.ProductsJob SearchLadders RecruiterExpert NetworkHighest Paying JobsHighest Paying CompaniesHighest Paying CareersHighest Paying IndustriesCities StatesRemote JobsHelpCareer AdviceFAQSMember HelpRecruiter HelpContact UsUnsubscribeAbout LaddersCompanyEditorial TeamLadders EstimatesPress MediaPrivacyTerms of UseEditorial PolicyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationSite MapWork at Ladders

What is Elon Musk s Favorite Food No ResultView All ResultNo ResultView All ResultHomeElon MuskWhat is Elon Musk s Favorite Food byBetty Jackson2020 10 06Elon Musk has come a long way since he fed himself on 1 a day and mostly ate oranges and hot dogs.
These days he can afford anything he wants to eat.
So what would he choose What is Elon Musk s favorite food French food and BBQ.
While these are more preparations then particular foods this is his answer when asked the question.
The two almost seem at odds with one another as they re kind of at the opposite ends of the preparation stratosphere.While Musk may have given up on oranges and hot dogs one thing he can t give up on is sweets.
Many times he s chosen to have aMars bar for breakfast instead of a proper breakfast.
As someone who travels around the world for business he has tasted a lot of cuisine.Musk s Eating HabitsElon Musk doesn t really stick to a particular diet.
Or really watch what he eats at all.
Often times during the day someone will bring him food for lunch and he ll just eat whatever is put in front of him.While he eats Mars bars for breakfast he s not averse to cereal he just prefers it in the middle of the night.Cinnamon Toast Crunchis his favorite to chow down on.How Tall Is Elon Musk Exact Height RevealedDid Elon Musk Grow Up Rich How Did Grimes And Elon Musk Meet In addition to giving up the 1 a day eating diet he s also reduced his caffeine intake previously driving large amounts ofDiet Coke and coffee.
He still continues to drink both just a more manageable level of about 3 each a day.
Which would still be a lot for some people.
Though if I worked as much as Elon Musk did I d probably drink the same amount.Ice cream sundae in a martini glasspic.twitter.com zAVFlOsYkM Elon Musk elonmusk May 13 2020A Family s Lack of InfluenceElon s younger brother Kimbal is almost the complete opposite of him when it comes to food.
The brothers have a lot in common when it comes to business as they joined forces to start their first business and have continued to be partners since.Kimbal has less of a visual role in Tesla and SpaceX though sits on the boards of each.
He is a professionally trained chef that owns multiple restaurants and eateries.
His big focuses are on sustainability and providing access to fresh food to all of America no matter where they are or their circumstance.While not a vegan himself he does have a vegan restaurant and promotes healthy eating.
The majority of his fuel comes from vegetables and fish.
A stark contrast to his older brother.
Elon has helped Kimbal with his initiatives but little brother hasn t been able to influence him to eat a healthier diet.In addition to his brother s healthy eating ways his mother s eating is healthy as well.
Supermodel Maye Musk is also a registered dietician and has helped many patients while she was providing for her three children.
Again no luck with convincing Elon that perhaps so much junk food isn t good.The Boring Company CandyNot sure if this is actually true or not but Musk talked about it on dates other than April 1st so perhaps there s some validity to it.
And thatitis that he s looking tostart a candybrand and or store.I m starting a candy company it s going to be amazing Elon Musk elonmusk May 5 2018He says he s serious and showed a picture of thefirst prototypeon his now deleted Instagram.
He went door to door selling candy to rich peopleWhile growing up in Pretoria Musk his brother Kimbal and their cousins traveled around the wealthy parts of the South African capital selling homemade chocolate Easter eggs.The adventurous group traveled door to door selling the sweets for 20 times the cost of making them.VIDEO1 0201 02Elon Musk s brother says this is how you raise entrepreneurial kidsMake It Voices I d make them for 50 cents and charge 10 for an Easter egg and I d always get this question like Why are you charging 10 for this little Easter egg said Kimbalto CNBC Make It in a 2017 interview.
And I was like Well you re supporting a young capitalist.
And the reality is if you don t buy it from me you re not going to get one and I know you can afford 10.
2.
He was bulliedMusk has been open about his difficult childhood discussing it most recently in last Sunday s 60 Minutes interview.
While he attended grade school in Pretoria South Africa Musk was not only theyoungest and smallest kid in his class but he was nerdier and muchmore into booksthan manyjocks at school.In Ashlee Vance s 2015 book Elon Musk Tesla SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future Musk said gangs of boys at would sometimes hunt him down going so far as to push him down a flight of stairs in one instance and send him to the hospital.
I was almost beaten to death he addedon 60 Minutes.
The bullying continueduntil he was 15 years old when went through a growth spurt and learned how to defend himself by doing karate judo and wrestling.
By 16 he said he was dishing it out as hard as they d give it to me.
3.
His parents thought he was deafMusk was so introspective as a kid that his parents and doctors ordered tests to check if he was deaf.
His mother Maye Musk eventually learned this was his way of daydreaming about his inventions.
He goes into his brain and then you just see he is in another world.
He still does that.
Now I just leave him be because I know he is designing a new rocket or something recalled Maye Musk in Vance s book.Though this bothered his peers who could reportedly yell at him and do jumping jacks beside him and he wouldn t notice Musk s pensive moments allowed him to visualize projects he d hope to tackle.4.
He made his own explosives and rocketsWhile his parents were away Musk lived mostly under the watch of a housekeeper.
According to Musk she was mainly there to make sure he didn t break anything.VIDEO1 5701 57The one trait that Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have in commonThe Definitive Guide to Business She wasn t like watching me.
I was off making explosives and reading books and building rockets and doing things that could have gotten me killed said Musk.
I m shocked that I have all my fingers.
5.
He had a penchant for readingThroughout his childhood books played a crucial role in fueling Musk s ambitions and entertaining him.Said Musk I was raised by books.
Books and then my parents.
He reportedly read the entire Encyclopedia Britannicaat age nineand would pore over science fiction novels comics and nonfiction books for up to 10 hours a day.
Some of themost influential books he readincluded The Lord of the Rings The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and Isaac Asimov s Foundation series.6.
He coded his own video game at 12 and got 500 for itIn the early days of computer coding a 12 year old Musk built a Blastar a science fiction inspired space game.
Similar to the classic Space Invaders arcade game the objective in Blastar was to destroy an alien spacecraft carrying deadly bombs.Although he s since called it atrivial game Blastar earned Musk an easy 500 after a South African trade publication published its source code.7.
He was master at Dungeons DragonsAlong with his cousins Musk loved playing the fantasy role playing game.
One time the teens went to Johannesburg for a Dungeons Dragons tournament.
That was us being nerd masters supremes Musk told Vance.VIDEO1 2901 29Ex Google exec 3 traits that make Elon Musk an exceptional leader and one major flawThe Definitive Guide to BusinessAccording to his cousin Peter Rive Musk helped their team win the tournament with his incredible imagination and ability to keep people captivated and inspired.
8.
He tried opening his own video arcade at 16Along with his younger cousins and Kimbal Muskgot the idea to open an arcadeby their high school according to Vance s book.
They got as far as signing a lease setting contracts together filling out forms at the city planning department.
But their plans were foiled when the city told them they were too young to get a real estate permit without an adult to sign off.According to Kimbal both his father and uncle flipped out when they brought up their arcade plans.9.
He moved to North America as a teenagerOnce Elon reached his teens he moved from his native South Africa tobegin his college studiesin North America.
At 17 he first emigrated to see what it takes to live he told Neil DeGrasse Tysonon StarTalk Radio.
Musk found that in America it s pretty easy to keep yourself alive.
Given that his threshold for existing was pretty low Musk was determined to survive on 1 a day by buying food at the supermarket in bulk.
I went more for the hotdogs and oranges you do get really tired of hot dogs and oranges after a while said Musk.
mixing things up every now and then with some pasta and green pepper and a big thing of sauce which he said could go pretty far too.

Elon Musk Recommends 12 Books that Changed his LifeSkip to main contentSkip to header right navigationSkip to site footerFarnam StreetMastering the best of what other people have already figured outHeader SearchSearch siteSubmit searchMenuArticlesNewsletterPodcastBooksCoursesSearchSearch siteSubmit searchLog InBecome a MemberTweetEmailLinkedInPrintBook Recommendations Reading Time 3minutesElon Musk Recommends 12 Books that Changed his LifeThe best thing about Elon Musk is that he makes us dream big again.
Musk of course is the billionaire and brilliant mind behind Tesla and SpaceX.Charlie Mungerwas asked a question about him at the 2014 Daily Journal Meeting and he replied I think Elon Musk is a genius and I don t use that word lightly.
I think he s also one of the boldest men that ever came down the pike.In fact after meeting Musk people tend to walk away with the same reaction He s the smartest guy I ve ever met.
Whenever anyone asks him how he learned to build rockets he says I read books.
Not only does he read them according to hisinterview with Esquire he devours them.
Musk takes us into his personal library and offers some recommendations of his own.In an interview withDesign and Architecture Musk said In terms of sci fi books I think Isaac Asimov is really great.
I like theFoundation series probably one of the all time best.
Robert Heinlein obviously.
I likeThe Moon Is a Harsh Mistressand I likeStranger in a Strange Land although it kind of goes off the rails at the end.
He continues There s a good book on structural design calledStructures Or Why Things Don t Fall Down.
It is really really good if you want a primer on structural design.
Here are some of his other reading recommendations.The Lord of the Ringsby J.R.R.
Tolkien.
He toldthe New Yorkerthat as an undersized and picked upon smart aleck he turned to reading fantasy and science fiction.
The heroes of the books I read The Lord of the Rings and the Foundation series always felt a duty to save the world.
Benjamin Franklin An American Lifeby Walter Isaacson.
He was an entrepreneur Musk says inan interview.
He started from nothing.
He was just a runaway kid.
In that same interview he also recommendsEinstein His Life and Universe also by Isaacson.Zero to One Notes on Startups or How to Build the Futureby Peter Thiel I ve already said this is required reading for Farnam Streeters.
On this book Musk says Peter Thiel has built multiple breakthrough companies and this book shows how.
Superintelligence Paths Dangers Strategiesby Nick Bostrom.
Worth reading Superintelligence by Bostrom.
We need to be super careful with AI.
Potentially more dangerous than nukes.
Musk tweeted.
Of course I bought this.Howard Hughes His Life and Madnessby Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele.Recently inan interview with CNN he mentioned having just finished this book.
Musk calls it a cautionary tale.
The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxyby Douglas Adams.
Here is an excerpt froman interviewwhere he explains why this was a key book for him Alison van Diggelen I understand Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy that wonderful book by Douglas Adams that was a key book for you.
What was it about that book that fired your imagination Elon Musk I guess when I was around 12 or 15 I had an existential crisis and I was reading various books on trying to figure out the meaning of life and what does it all mean It all seemed quite meaningless and then we happened to have some books by Nietzsche and Schopenhauer in the house which you should not read at age 14 laughter .
It is bad it s really negative.
So then I read Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy which is quite positive I think and it highlighted an important point which is that a lot of times the question is harder than the answer.
And if you can properly phrase the question then the answer is the easy part.
So to the degree that we can better understand the universe then we can better know what questions to ask.
Then whatever the question is that most approximates what s the meaning of life That s the question we can ultimately get closer to understanding.
And so I thought to the degree that we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness and knowledge then that would be a good thing.
Finally we get to the rocket science part.Ignition An informal history of liquid rocket propellantsby John D. Clark.
There is a good book on rocket stuff called Ignition by John Clark that s a really fun one Musk said inan interview.
Becoming a rocket scientist isn t cheap.

His voracious reading habit was essential to launching his history making career.Here are eight books that shaped the revolutionary entrepreneur 1.
Structures Or Why Things Don t Fall Down by J.E.
GordonWhen Musk decided he wanted to learn rocket science he studied textbooks on astrophysics and engineering.
While reading advanced texts on physics may not be for everyone this book offers a lighter take on the science behind SpaceX.
It is really really good if you want a primer on structural design Musksays in an interview with KCRW.2.
Benjamin Franklin An American Life by Walter IsaacsonBen Franklin author inventor scientist and diplomat is one of Musk sheroes.
You can see how Franklin was an entrepreneur Musk says in an interview with Foundation s Kevin Rose.
He was an entrepreneur.
Einstein His Life and Universe by Walter IsaacsonMusktells Rosehe was influenced by the biography of theoretical physicist Albert Einstein and it s clear why.Some of Einstein s most famous quotes like The important thing is not to stop questioning and Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new speak directly to Musk s vision for his companies.4.
Superintelligence Paths Dangers Strategies by Nick BostromThough Musk is a futurist and deeply interested in artificial intelligence he has shared his worries about potential dangers and ethical concerns associated with the technology.Bostrom s book which deals with the potential challenges presented should computational intelligence surpass human intelligence is worth reading Musk tweeted in 2014.5.
Merchants of Doubt by Erik M. Conway and Naomi OreskesMusk recommends this argument by two historians who believe that scientists with political and corporate connections have purposefully muddied the facts around many public health issues such as the negative effects of smoking.
He posted his recommendation on Twitter in 2013.6.

It didn t matter what position they were interviewing for he wanted to talk to everyone.
According tohis biography many of those who sat across from Musk would be asked his favorite brain teaser interview question You re standing on the surface of the earth.
You walk one mile south one mile west and one mile north.
You end up exactly where you started.
Where are you How to answer Elon Musk s interview questionIf you re scratching your head at this brain teaser you re not alone.
Apparently engineers usually solved the problem and guessed the correct answer the North Pole.
Following Musk s directions and using the North Pole as the start location you d make a triangle and end up right where you began.
Another potential answer could be the South Pole.The good news Musk wasn t too concerned with job candidates giving him the right answer.
When interviewers ask brain teaser questions like this one they re looking to gauge the candidate s critical thinking skills and ability to operate under pressure not necessarily for the correct answer.
Interviewers use these questions to see if you can think and resolve issues quickly with what data they present TopInteview coach Nick D.says.
The answer is often irrelevant.
It s the candidate s way of coming to the conclusion that matters.
What to do if you don t know the answer to the questionLet s say an interviewer asks you a question like this and you re totally baffled.
What do you do First don t panic.
Remember interviewers aren t necessarily looking for the correct answer.
They just want to get a better idea of the way you process information and solve problems.
Second don t try to avoid the question.
Don t try to talk around a question or pretend you have some expertise when you don t Nick says.
An employer wants to know you are honest and have integrity.
If you are insincere or lie bye bye.
If you need feel free to ask follow up questions to clarify what the interviewer is asking.
This will show them you re curious and give them a glimpse into how you solve problems.
Then even if you re not sure about the answer start talking through your thought process.
Break the problem down explain your assumptions and map out exactly how you d arrive at your answer whatever it ends up being.Types of brain teaser interview questionsWhen it comes to preparing for brain teasers it helps to understand that these types of questions are typically grouped into two categories process and creative.Elon Musk asked his candidates a process question which is popular for engineering positions.
The question likely won t have an obvious answer and the candidate will need to talk it through with a step by step analysis.Here s another example of a process focused brain teaser question There s a school bus parked outside.
Approximately how many golf balls would fit inside it Again you probably can t tell the interviewer exactly how many golf balls can fit into a school bus but Nick offered up an example of how you could respond I would calculate or look up the volume of the interior bus space subtract the volume occupied by the seats take the volume of a standard gold ball and divide one into the other to acquire an estimate for the number of golf balls that could fit.
There are also creative brain teasers to consider.
An example of a creative brain teaser question is If you were an African animal which one would you be and why With this question there really isn t a correct answer.
An interviewer simply wants to get to know you better and get a glimpse into the way you think.Nick offered an example of how you could answer that question I would be a male lion as they are instinctive leaders who support their pride.
They ensure each member is successful safe and has what they need to survive.
They re focused on the growth and well being of the group nevermind they sleep 18 plus hours a day and only wake up to eat and play.
How to prepare for brain teaser interview questionsLike your classicbehavioral interview questions the best way to prepare for brain teaser or riddle questions is to practice.
You can find lists of these types of interview questions online so take some time to answer a handful of them talking through your thought process asking clarifying questions and explaining exactly how you d arrive at your answer even if you don t know the answer off the top of your head.Also remember to stay calm take a deep breath and don t try to wiggle your way out of the question.
The interviewer simply wants to better understand the way you operate and process information so don t shy away from letting them know.Want to practice answering these types of interview questions with a professional interview coach TopInterview s experts can help Connect with a coach today.Recommended Reading What s a Stress Interview And How to Prepare For OneBeware These Interview Questions Are Trickier Than They Appear7 Times an Interview Coach Is Definitely Worth ItRelated Articles How to Prepare for a Software Engineering Job Interview7 Common Interview Questions for an Executive Director and How to Answer Them10 Adaptability Interview Questions and AnswersSearchSearchNeed a prep talk Learn how to crush your interview with confidence.Get started Share this article SearchQuestions We can help.Our team is standing by happy to help answer any questions or address any concerns you may have.

And when the American Society of Mechanical EngineersprofiledElon Musk they noted While Mr. Musk does not have an engineering degree per say he holds degrees in Physics and Economics from the University of Pennsylvania few dispute his assertion in response to his focus on technical details as CEO of Tesla and Space X I m an engineer so what I do is engineering.
That s what I m good at.
Clearly Musk likes engineering.
But do engineers like Musk It appears so.When considering their dream job undergrad engineering students love Elon Musk s high profile companies Tesla Motors and SpaceX.
Take a look at the top five ideal employers that engineering students voted for in a recent survey by Universum.Elon Musk s Tesla Motors and SpaceX both ranked in the elite top five dream jobs for engineering students out of 230 companies.It s no wonder Musk has always been vocal about the importance of engineering and his admiration for engineers.So can Elon Musk really attract top engineering talent to Tesla Forbes reported that Universum head of research and insights for the Americas Kevin Troy noted that they engineering students are leaning away from more traditional employers and pursuing careers at companies like Tesla.
In addition he explained Space software and engineering companies both new guard engineering companies like Tesla and traditional ones like Boeing remain highly attractive to these students.
With Elon Muskdoublinghis forecast for Tesla s vehicle production when he announced this week thatthe 2020 target for Tesla vehicles is closer to a million the need for top talent has never been greater.
That said it s remarkable to see so many young engineers enamored with Tesla.What was Universum s research methodology Universum takes a look at the employers by which students on the cusp of joining the workforce are most intrigued.
To determine the companies currently providing the most coveted jobs to students at American universities Universum surveyed nearly 72 223 undergraduates at 359 universities in 165 areas of study including 11 544 engineering majors.Students were surveyed over a five month period... identifying companies for which they would most want to work.

So what are the top traits hiring managers need to look for and how do they spot them in a candidate According toElon Musk it s not about what school you went to or your level of education.
There s no need even to have a college degree at all or even high school the Tesla CEO said during a2014 interview with Auto Bild.Don t miss The best credit cards for building creditInstead Musk looks for evidence of exceptional ability when it comes to hiring.
If there s a track record of exceptional achievement then it s likely that that will continue into the future he said.How Elon Musk spots a liarThe problem is that anyone can say they re the best at what they do but it can be hard and at times impossible to know whether they re telling the truth.Luckily Musk revealed his solution at theWorld Government Summitin 2017.
He asks each candidate he interviews the same question Tell me about some of the most difficult problems you worked on and how you solved them.
Because the people whoreallysolved the problem know exactly how they solved it he said.
They know and can describe the little details.
Musk s method hinges on the idea that someone making a false claim will lack the ability to back it up convincingly so he wants to hear them talk about how they worked through a thorny issue step by step.Musk s strategy is effective study findsA study published inthe Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognitionlast year in December uncovered several approaches to spotting liars based on a job interviewing technique that funnily enough backs up the effectiveness of what Musk has been doing for years.One such technique called Asymmetric Information Management AIM is designed to provide an interviewee with a clear means to demonstrate their innocence or guilt to the investigator by providing detailed information.
Small details are the lifeblood of forensic investigations and can provide investigators with facts to check and witnesses to question Cody Porter one of the study s authors and a Senior Teaching Fellow at the University of Portsmouth wrote in an article for The Conversation.Specifically she added interviewers should give clear instructions to interviewees that if they provide longer more detailed statements about the event of interest then the investigator will be better able to detect if they are telling the truth or lying.
Porter and her team of researchers found that truth tellers typically seek to demonstrate their innocence and commonly provide more detailed information in response to such instructions.
In contrast liars wish to conceal their guilt Porter explained.
This means they are more likely to strategically withhold information in response to the AIM method.
Their assumption here is that providing more information will make it easier for the investigator to detect their lie so instead they provide less information.
If you want the job tell the truth and be as detailed as possibleThe study also found that using the AIM method can increase the likelihood of detecting liars by nearly 70 .
That s good news for Musk and other hiring managers who adopt this science backed strategy.As Musk said in the interview with Auto Bild what he really wants to know is whether a candidate truly solved the problem they claimed to have solved.
And of course you want to make sure if there was some significant accomplishment were they really responsible or was someone else more responsible Musk added.
Usually someone who really had to struggle with a problem they really understand the details and they don t forget.
After all no one wants to hire someone who is all talk and no action.
So if you want the job don t skimp on the details.Tom Popomaronisis a leadership expert and vice president of innovation atMassive Alliance.His work has been featured in Forbes Fast Company Inc. and The Washington Post.

Musk steps in as CEO .The New York Times.Archivedfrom the original on February 4 2016.
Elon ended up enrolling at Queen s University in Kingston Ontario in 1989.
He picked Queen s over the University of Waterloo because he felt there were more good looking women at Queen s. Outside of his studies Elon would read the newspaper alongside Kimbal and the two of them would identify interesting people they would like to meet.
They then took turns cold calling these people to ask if they were available to have lunch.
Among the harassed was the head of marketing for the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team a business writer for the Globe and Mail and a top executive at the Bank of Nova Scotia Peter Nicholson.
Nicholson remembered the boys call well.
I was not in the habit of getting out of the blue requests he said.
I was perfectly prepared to have lunch with a couple of kids that had that kind of gumption.
It took six months to get on Nicholson s calendar but sure enough the Musk brothers made a threehour train ride and showed up on time.
The second sentence out of his mouth was I think a lot about electric cars.
Nicholson s first exposure to the Musk brothers left him with an impression many would share.
Both presented themselves well and were polite.
Elon though clearly came off as the geekier more awkward counterpoint to the charismatic personable Kimbal.
I became more impressed and fascinated as I talked to them Nicholson said.
They were so determined.
Nicholson ended up offering Elon a summer internship at the bank and became his trusted advisor.Not long after their initial meeting Elon invited Peter Nicholson s daughter Christie to his birthday party.
Christie showed up at Maye s Toronto apartment with a jar of homemade lemon curd in hand and was greeted by Elon and about fifteen other people.
Elon had never met Christie before but he went right up to her and led her to a couch.
Then I believe the second sentence out of his mouth was I think a lot about electric cars Christie said.
And then he turned to me and said Do you think about electric cars The conversation left Christie who is now a science writer with the distinct impression that Musk was handsome affable and a tremendous nerd.
For whatever reason I was so struck by that moment on the sofa she said.
You could tell that this person was very different.
He captivated me in that way.
With her angular features and blond hair Christie fit Musk s type and the two stayed in touch during Musk s time in Canada.
They never really dated but Christie found Musk interesting enough to have lengthy conversations with him on the phone.
After one economics exam Musk Farooq and some other students in class came back to the dorms and began comparing notes to try to ascertain how well they did on the test.
It soon became clear that Musk had a firmer grasp on the material than anyone else.
This was a group of fairly high achievers and Elon stood way outside of the bell curve Farooq said.
Musk s intensity has continued to be a constant in their long relationship.
When Elon gets into something he develops just this different level of interest in it than other people.
That is what differentiates Elon from the rest of humanity.
In 1992 having spent two years at Queen s Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania on a scholarship.
Musk saw the Ivy League school as possibly opening some additional doors and went off in pursuit of dual degrees first an economics degree from the Wharton School and then a bachelor s degree in physics.
Justine stayed at Queen s pursuing her dream of becoming a writer and maintained a long distance relationship with Musk.
Now and again she would visit him and the two would sometimes head off to New York for a romantic weekend.
It was a full out unlicensed speakeasy Musk blossomed even more at Penn and really started to feel comfortable while hanging out with his fellow physics students.
At Penn he met people that thought like him Maye said.
There were some nerds there.
He so enjoyed them.
I remember going for lunch with them and they were talking physics things.
They were saying A plus B equals pi squared or whatever.
They would laugh out loud.
It was cool to see him so happy.
Once again however Musk did not make many friends among the broader school body.
It s difficult to find former students who remember him being there at all.
But he did make one very close friend named Adeo Ressi who would go on to be a Silicon Valley entrepreneur in his own right and is to this day as tight with Elon as anyone.Ressi is a lanky guy well over six feet tall and possesses an eccentric air.
He was the artistic colorful foil to the studious more buttoned up Musk.
Both of the young men were transfer students and ended up being placed in the funky freshman dorm.
The lackluster social scene did not live up to Ressi s expectations and he talked Musk into renting a large house off campus.
They got the ten bedroom home relatively cheap since it was a frat house that had gone unrented.
During the week Musk and Ressi would study but as the weekend approached Ressi in particular would transform the house into a nightclub.
He covered the windows with trash bags to make it pitch black inside and decorated the walls with bright paints and whatever objects he could find.
It was a full out unlicensed speakeasy Ressi said.
We would have as many as five hundred people.
We would charge five dollars and it would be pretty much all you could drink beer and Jell O shots and other things.
Come Friday night the ground around the house would shake from the intensity of the bass being pumped out by Ressi s speakers.
Maye visited one of the parties and discovered that Ressi had hammered objects into the walls and lacquered them with glowin the dark paint.
She ended up working the door as the coat check money taker and grabbed a pair of scissors for protection as the cash piled up in a shoe box.A second house had fourteen rooms.
Born and raised in South Africa Musk spent time in Canada before moving to the United States.Educated at the University of Pennsylvania in physics Musk started getting his feet wet as a serial tech entrepreneur with early successes like Zip2 and X.com which merged with a company that became PayPal.Musk has behaved eccentrically from time to time.
He has said he has Asperger s syndrome.Bailey Mariner InvestopediaEarly Life and EducationElon Reeve Musk was born in 1971 in Pretoria South Africa the oldest of three children.
His father was a South African engineer and his mother was a Canadian model and nutritionist.After his parents divorced in 1980 Musk lived primarily with his father.
He would later dub his father a terrible human being...almost every evil thing you could possibly think of he has done.
I had a terrible upbringing.
I had a lot of adversity growing up.
One thing I worry about with my kids is they don t face enough adversity Musk would later say.Bullied as a ChildMusk attended the private English speaking Waterkloof House Preparatory School he started a year early and later graduated from Pretoria Boys High School.
A self described bookworm he made few friends in those places.
They got my best expletive friend to lure me out of hiding so they could beat me up.
And that expletive hurt Musk said.
For some reason they decided that I was it and they were going to go after me nonstop.
That s what made growing up difficult.
For a number of years there was no respite.
You get chased around by gangs at school who tried to beat the expletive out of me and then I d come home and it would just be awful there as well.
Early AccomplishmentsTechnology became an escape for Musk.
At 10 he became acquainted with programming using a Commodore VIC 20 an early and relatively inexpensive home computer.
Before long Musk had become proficient enough to create Blastar a video game in the style of Space Invaders.
He sold the BASIC code for the game to a PC magazine for 500.In one telling incident from his childhood Musk and his brother planned to open a video game arcade near their school.
Their parents nixed the plan.Musk s College YearsAt 17 Musk moved to Canada.
He would later obtain Canadian citizenship through his mother.After emigrating to Canada Musk enrolled at Queen s University in Kingston Ontario.
It was there that he met Justine Wilson an aspiring writer.
They would marry and have five sons together twins and triplets before divorcing in 2008.Entering the U.S.After two years at Queen s University Musk transferred to the University of Pennsylvania.
He took on two majors but his time there wasn t all work and no play.
With a fellow student he bought a 10 bedroom fraternity house which they used as an ad hoc nightclub.Musk graduated with a bachelor of science degree in physics in addition to a bachelor of arts in economics from theWharton School.The two majors foreshadowed Musk s career but it was physics that left the deepest impression.
Physics is a good framework for thinking he would say later.
Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there.
Notable AccomplishmentsMusk was 24 years old when he moved to California to pursue a Ph.D. in applied physics at Stanford University.
But with the internet exploding and Silicon Valley booming Musk had entrepreneurial visions dancing in his head.
He left the Ph.D. program after just two days.X.comIn 1995 with 15 000 and his younger brother Kimbal at his side Musk started Zip2 a web software company that would help newspapers develop online city guides.In 1999 Zip2 was acquired by Compaq Computer Corp. for 341 million.Musk used his Zip2 buyout money to create X.com afintechventure before that term was in wide circulation.X.com merged with a money transfer firm called Confinity and the resulting company came to be known as PayPal.Peter Thiel ousted Musk as PayPal CEO before eBay EBAY bought the payments company for 1.5 billion but Musk still profited from the buyout via his 11.7 PayPal stake.
My proceeds from PayPal after tax were about 180 million Musk said in a 2018 interview.
100 million of that went into SpaceX 70 million into Tesla and 10 million into SolarCity.
And I literally had to borrow money for rent.
In 2017 Musk purchased the X.com domain name back from PayPal citing its sentimental value.TeslaMusk became involved with the electric cars venture as an early investor in 2004 ultimately contributing about 6.3 million to begin with and joined the team including engineer Martin Eberhard to help run a company then known as Tesla Motors.
Following a series of disagreements Eberhard was ousted in 2007 and an interim CEO was hired until Musk assumed control as CEO and product architect.
Under his watch Tesla has become the world s most valuable automaker.In addition to producing electric vehicles Tesla maintains a robust presence in the solar energy space thanks to its acquisition of SolarCity.The company currently produces two rechargeable solar batteries.
The smaller Powerwall was developed for home backup power and off the grid use while the larger Powerpack is intended for commercial or electric utility grid use.SpaceXMusk used most of the proceeds from his PayPal stake to found Space Exploration Technologies Corp. the rocket s developer commonly known as SpaceX.
By his own account Musk spent 100 millionto found SpaceX in 2002.Under Musk s leadership SpaceX landed several high profile contracts with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA and the U.S. Air Force to design space launch rockets.Musk has publicized plans to send an astronaut to Mars by 2025 in a collaborative effort with NASA.TwitterA frequent poster on the messaging network Musk disclosed a 9.2 stake in Twitter in April 2022.Twitter responded by offering Musk a seat on the board which he accepted before declining days later.Musk then sent abear hugletter to Twitter s board proposing to buy the company at 54.20 per share.Twitter s board adopted apoison pillprovision to discourage Musk from accumulating an even larger stake but they ultimately accepted Musk s offer after he disclosed 46.5 billion in committed financing for the deal in a securities filing.In July 2022 Muskattempted to cancel the deal arguing that Twitter had failed to provide certain information regarding fake accounts.
The companysued Muskto require him to complete the deal.After months of legal wrangling the billionaire s plan to buy the social media platform came to fruition and Musk took control of Twitter on Oct. 28 2022.Personal EccentricitiesOn Sept. 7 2018 Musk smoked cannabis during a filmed interview for a podcast.Just a month earlier Musk posted an infamous tweet claiming he was considering taking Tesla private and had secured the needed funding.Musk subsequently settled a U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission SEC complaint alleging he knowingly misled investors with the tweet by paying a 20 million fine along with the same penalty for Tesla and agreeing to let Tesla s lawyers approve tweets with material corporate information before posting.In March 2022 Musk filed a court motion to overturn the consent decree stemming from that case.In April 2022 during a live TED Talk Musk called the SEC regulators on the case bastards.
During his May 8 2021 appearance on the TV showSaturday Night Live Musk revealed that he has Asperger s syndrome an autism spectrum disorder.
I m actually making history tonight as the first person with Asperger s to hostSNL.
Or at least the first to admit it he said.
How does the neurodevelopment condition manifest itself I don t always have a lot of intonation or variation in how I speak which I m told makes for great comedy Musk explained.Is Elon Musk Married Elon Musk has been divorced three times twice from his second wife Talulah Riley.From 2018 to 2022 he had been in a relationship with Canadian singer songwriter Claire Elise Boucher professionally known as Grimes with whom he had a son in 2020 and a daughter in 2022.

The new CEO of Twitter is amazing Musk wrote.
So much better than the other guy.
A pair of follow up tweets showed Floki wearing a pair of glasses while climbing across his executive s desk and pawing through a spread of Twitter paperwork.
He s great with numbers Musk wrote in one tweet adding And has style in another.The humorous tweets come as Musk told the World Government Summit conference in Dubai that a new CEO should be running Twitter and that he was likely to have one in place by the end of 2023.Speaking to the summit by video call Musk said it had been a rollercoaster since he took the reins at Twitter last year.
I m guessing probably towards the end of this year should be good timing to find someone else to run the company he told the World Government Summit conference in Dubai via video.
I need to stabilize the organization and make sure it s in a healthy place and that the product roadmap is clearly laid out...
I think it should be in a stable position around the end of this year.
Musk paid 44 billion for his favorite social media platform and exiting day to day operations would allow him to deflect criticism that he is neglecting his other ventures especially car company Tesla which has seen its share price plummet since he took over Twitter.Forbes estimates Musk s wealth at just under 200 billion.
The Forbes analysis ranks Musk as the second wealthiest person on Earth just behind French luxury brand magnate Bernard Arnault.Tech billionaire Elon Musk tells the World Government Summit in Dubai that a new CEO might be running Twitter by the end of 2023 after a rollercoaster since he took full ownership of the online platform in OctoberUAE Minister of Cabinet Affairs Mohammad al Gergawi L on stage speaks with Elon Musk attending the World Government Summit virtually in Dubai on February 15 2023Elon Musk sits between Rupert and Elisabeth Murdoch as they watch the Kansas City Chiefs play the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII from a box in State Farm Stadium in Glendale Arizona U.S. February 12 2023Musk has given few clues to what type of leader he is looking for.On December 21 when he first announced he planned to step down as CEO he said only that he would limit his own duties to software and server engineering once someone foolish enough had taken his place.Since Musk took full ownership of Twitter on October 27 the platform has undergone a series of rapid changes with its CEO courting high praise and harsh criticism in equal measure.
It has been a rollercoaster Musk told the Dubai conference.Last week thousands of Twitter users reported problems using the platform as the social network allowed paying users to post tweets as long as 4 000 characters.US tech media reported that Musk put out word to Twitter staff to put aside work on new features to focus on troubleshooting.Despite the difficulties the Twitter boss encouraged more communication.
As a forum for communication it s great.
And I would just encourage more communication... to sort of speak in an authentic voice.
Sometimes people will have someone else be their sort of Twitter manager or something like that.
People should just do their own tweets...
I think that s the way to do it.
Elon Musk talks virtually during the World Government Summit in Dubai United Arab Emirates Wednesday Feb. 15 2023A sign at Twitter headquarters is shown in San Francisco Dec. 8 2022Musk 51 made his wealth initially on the finance website PayPal then created the spacecraft company SpaceX and invested in the electric car company Tesla.He donated shares worth 1.95 billion in Tesla now the world s most valuable car maker to charity last year a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC showed on Tuesday.Musk donated about 11.6 million shares between August and December last year according to the filing which did not say which organization or organizations were the recipients.The Tesla CEO signed the Giving Pledge in 2012 a commitment by some billionaires to give at least half their wealth to philanthropy in their lifetime or upon their death.In 2001 he set up the Musk Foundation offering grants for the development of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanity among other causes according to its website.In recent months however more attention has been focused on the chaos surrounding his 44 billion purchase of Twitter and the Ukrainian military s use of Musk s Starlink satellites for their communications.At today s conference in Dubai Musk offered a wide ranging 35 minute discussion that touched on his fears about artificial intelligence the collapse of civilization and the possibility of space aliens.But questions about Twitter kept coming back up as Musk described both Tesla and SpaceX as able to function without his direct day to day involvement.
Twitter is still somewhat a startup in reverse he said.
There s work required here to get Twitter to sort of a stable position and to really build the engine of software engineering.
Musk also sought to portray his takeover of San Francisco based Twitter as a cultural correction.
I think that the general idea is just to reflect the values of the people as opposed to imposing the values of essentially San Francisco and Berkeley which are so somewhat of a niche ideology as compared to the rest of the world he said.
And you know Twitter was I think doing a little too much to impose a niche.
Musk 51 made his wealth initially on the finance website PayPal then created the spacecraft company SpaceX and invested in the electric car company TeslaTesla CEO Elon Musk is pictured opening a new Tesla Gigafactory in Germany March 2022SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrives on the red carpet for the Axel Springer Awards ceremony in Berlin on December 1 2020Musk s takeover at Twitter has seen mass firings and other cost cutting measures as he tries to maximize profits at the company.However some of Musk s decisions have conflicted with the reasons that journalists governments and others rely on Twitter as an information sharing platform.Musk on Wednesday described the need for users to rely on Twitter for trusted information from verified accounts.
However a confused rollout to a paid verified account system saw some impersonate famous companies leading to a further withdrawal of needed advertising cash to the site.But Musk also has become a thought leader for some as well albeit an oracle that is trying to get six hours of sleep a night despite the challenges at Twitter.Musk described his children as being programmed by Reddit and YouTube.
He warned that artificial intelligence should be regulated very carefully describing it as akin to the promise of nuclear power but the danger of atomic bombs.He also cautioned against having a single civilization or too much cooperation on Earth saying it could collapse a society that s like a tiny candle in a vast darkness.
And asked about the existence of aliens Musk had a firm response.
The crazy thing is I ve seen no evidence of alien technology or alien life whatsoever.
And I think I d know because of SpaceX he said.
I don t think anybody knows more about space you know than me.

Rachel AbelaElon Musknever fails to give people something to talk about.
More recently he pitched an offer to purchase the microblogging social media platform Twitter for 43 billion.The self proclaimed free speech absolutist wanted to purchase the website to promote independence and freedom of speech while hopefully removingcensorshipon legal need to be talked about topics like cannabis.Musk worth 259 billion according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index has presented his slight fondness for marijuana on several occasions.
Whether he s being serious or playing around with followers in a cheeky whimsical way Musk has chosen to use the number 420 in oddly different ventures.According toThe Street we first saw the Tesla founder bring 420 to the masses when he tweeted a few years ago that he s considering taking Tesla private at 420.
Photo courtesy of TeslaWhen he pitched his offer to purchase Twitter for 43 billion that would add up to 54.20 per share with emphasis on the last three digits.
It s almost like with every purchase investment or news worthy announcement.
The SpaceX founder looks to poke fun at the seriousness of each endeavor.He s done so by adding a nerdy meme a reference to 420 cannabis culture or simply just letting everyone know that he has a sense of humor.The Street points out that420 might be Elon s lucky number considering it s popped up in two pivotal transactions but he hasn t shared any reasons for why he chose this number even though some believe Musk might dabble in weed here and there.A few years ago the entrepreneurial enigma appeared on Joe Rogan s podcast The Joe Rogan Experience where he was given Rogan s blunt and encouraged to hit it considering its legal status in California.Photo courtesy of Joe Rogan Show YouTubeAperplexed Musk gazed at the smokey blunt and when Rogan asked Do people get upset if you do certain things like smoking marijuana Musk leaned in for a hefty draw.He didn t inhale the blunt but the scene brought another iconic meme to life that he s shared quite a bit since then.Suppose the Tesla and SpaceX founder goes through with purchasing the microblogging website Twitter.
In that case we can only hope he ll remove barriers for cannabis companies to promote products and lifestyle choices without censorship.The cannabis industry has seen its fair share of censorship.
A few years ago Twitter actually blocked all cannabis related searches for a week.Culture5 Independent Music Videos You Must Watch While You re HighDeLorean BlackHerbworthyHerbworthy Z s Life ZBooksMelissa Jaramilloenter your email below to get insider updates delivered straight to your inbox.submitLatestprivacytermsfaqaboutadvertise with herbnewsletters
