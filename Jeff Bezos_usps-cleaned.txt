Shaw & Co. in 1990.
Soon named senior vice president—the firm’s youngest—Bezos was in charge of examining theinvestmentpossibilities of the Internet.
Its enormous potential—Web usage was growing by more than 2,000 percent a year—sparked his entrepreneurial imagination.
In 1994 he quit D.E.

Named after the South American river, Amazon sold its first book in July 1995.Amazon.comJeff BezosAmazon quickly became the leader in e-commerce.
Open 24 hours a day, the site was user-friendly, encouraging browsers to post their own reviews of books and offering discounts, personalized recommendations, and searches for out-of-print books.

In 1999 Bezos added auctions to the site andinvestedin other virtual stores.
The success of Amazon encouraged other retailers, including major book chains, to establish online stores.As more companies battled for Internet dollars, Bezos saw the need to diversify, and by 2005 Amazon offered a vast array of products, including consumer electronics, apparel, and hardware.
Amazon diversified even further in 2006 by introducingAmazon Web Services(AWS), acloud-computingservice that eventually became the largest such service in the world.
In late 2007 Amazon released a new handheld reading device called theKindle, a digital book reader with wireless Internet connectivity, enabling customers to purchase, download, read, and store avastselection of books on demand.
Amazon announced in 2010 that sales of Kindle books had surpassed those of hardcover books.
That same year Amazon moved into making its own television shows and movies with its Amazon Studios division.
Amazon’s yearly net sales increased from $510,000 in 1995 to some $600 million in 1998 and from more than $19.1 billion in 2008 to almost $233 billion in 2018.
About half of the company’s operating income in 2018 was derived from AWS.
Two years later Amazon registered record profits, and its revenue in the fourth quarter that year surpassed $100 billion for the first time.
The unprecedented numbers were, in part, caused by a rise in home shopping during theCOVID-19pandemic.In February 2021 Bezos announced that he would be stepping down as CEO later that year.

His successful business ventures have made him one of the richest people in the world.Updated: Oct 22, 2021Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images(1964-)Who Is Jeff Bezos?Entrepreneur and e-commerce pioneer Jeff Bezos is the founder and CEO of the e-commerce company Amazon, owner ofThe Washington Postand founder of the space exploration company Blue Origin.
His successful business ventures have made him one of the richest people in the world.
Born in 1964 in New Mexico, Bezos had an early love of computers and studied computer science and electrical engineering at Princeton University.
After graduation, he worked on Wall Street, and in 1990 he became the youngest senior vice president at the investment firm D.E.
Four years later, Bezos quit his lucrative job to open Amazon.com, an online bookstore that became one of the Internet's biggest success stories.
In 2013, Bezos purchasedThe Washington Post, and in 2017 Amazon acquired Whole Foods.
In February 2021, Amazon announced that Bezos will step down as CEO in the third quarter of the year.Early Life and EducationBezos was born on January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to a teenage mother, Jacklyn Gise Jorgensen, and his biological father, Ted Jorgensen.The Jorgensens were married less than a year.
When Bezos was 4 years old, his mother remarried Mike Bezos, a Cuban immigrant.Bezos graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1986 with a degree in computer science and electrical engineering.Bezos showed an early interest in how things work, turning his parents' garage into a laboratory and rigging electrical contraptions around his house as a child.He moved to Miami with his family as a teenager, where he developed a love for computers and graduated valedictorian of his high school.
It was during high school that he started his first business, the Dream Institute, an educational summer camp for fourth, fifth and sixth graders.Career in FinanceAfter graduating from Princeton, Bezos found work at several firms on Wall Street, including Fitel, Bankers Trust and the investment firm D.E.
In 1990, Bezos became D.E.
Shaw's youngest vice president.While his career in finance was extremely lucrative, Bezos chose to make a risky move into the nascent world of e-commerce.
He quit his job in 1994, moved to Seattle and targeted the untapped potential of the Internet market by opening an online bookstore.Founder and CEO of Amazon.comBezos opened Amazon.com, named after the meandering South American river, on July 16, 1995, after asking 300 friends to beta test his site.
In the months leading up to launch, a few employees began developing software with Bezos in his garage; they eventually expanded operations into a two-bedroom house equipped with three Sun Microstations.The initial success of the company was meteoric.
With no press promotion, Amazon.com sold books across the United States and in 45 foreign countries within 30 days.
In two months, sales reached $20,000 a week, growing faster than Bezos and his startup team had envisioned.Amazon.com went public in 1997, leading many market analysts to question whether the company could hold its own when traditional retailers launched their own e-commerce sites.
Two years later, the start-up not only kept up, but also outpaced competitors, becoming an e-commerce leader.Bezos continued to diversify Amazon’s offerings with the sale of CDs and videos in 1998, and later clothes, electronics, toys and more through major retail partnerships.While many dot.coms of the early '90s went bust, Amazon flourished with yearly sales that jumped from $510,000 in 1995 to over $17 billion in 2011.As part of Bezos' 2018 annual shareholder letter, the media tycoon said the company had surpassed 100 million paid subscribers for Amazon Prime.
By September 2018, Amazon was valued at more than $1 trillion, the second company to ever hit that record just a few weeks after Apple.At the end of 2018, Amazon announced it was raising the minimum wage for its workers to $15 per hour.
The company has still been criticized for its working conditions and grueling pace, with workers protesting during Prime Day in July 2019.Amazon Instant Video & Amazon StudiosIn 2006, Amazon.com launched its video-on-demand service.
Initially known as Amazon Unbox on TiVo, it was eventually rebranded as Amazon Instant Video.Bezos premiered several original programs with the launch of Amazon Studios in 2013.
The company hit it big in 2014 with the critically-acclaimedTransparentandMozart in the Jungle.The company produced and released its first original feature film,Spike Lee'sChi-Raq,In 2015.In 2016, Bezos stepped in front of the camera for a cameo appearance playing an alien inStar Trek Beyond.AStar Trekfan since childhood, Bezos is listed as a Starfleet Official in the movie credits onIMDb.In early 2018,The Seattle Timesreported that Amazon had consolidated its consumer retail operations in order to focus on growing areas including digital entertainment and Alexa, Amazon's virtual assistant.Kindle E-ReaderAmazon released the Kindle, a handheld digital book reader that allowed users to buy, download, read and store their book selections, in 2007.Bezos entered Amazon into the tablet marketplace with the unveiling of the Kindle Fire in 2011.
The following September, he announced the new Kindle Fire HD, the company's next-generation tablet designed to give Apple's iPad a run for its money.
We haven't built the best tablet at a certain price.
We have built the best tablet at any price," Bezos said, according toABC News.Amazon DronesIn early December 2013, Bezos made headlines when he revealed a new, experimental initiative by Amazon, called "Amazon Prime Air," using drones to provide delivery services to customers.
He said these drones would be able to carry items weighing up to five pounds and be capable of traveling within a 10-mile distance of the company's distribution center.The first Prime Air delivery took place in Cambridge, England, on December 7, 2016.Fire PhoneBezos oversaw one of Amazon's few major missteps when the company launched the Fire Phone in 2014.
Criticized for being too gimmicky, it was discontinued the following year.Whole FoodsBezos had been eyeing the food delivery market, and in 2017 Amazon announced it had acquired the Whole Foods grocery chain for $13.7 billion in cash.The company began offering in-store deals to Amazon Prime customers and grocery delivery in as little as two hours, depending on the market.
As a result, Walmart and Krogers also began offering meal delivery to its customers.DOWNLOAD BIOGRAPHY'S JEFF BEZOS FACT CARDOwner of 'The Washington Post'On August 5, 2013, Bezos made headlines worldwide when he purchasedTheWashington Postand other publications affiliated with its parent company, The Washington Post Co., for $250 million.The deal marked the end of the four-generation reign over The Post Co. by the Graham family, which included Donald E. Graham, the company's chairman and chief executive, and his niece,PostpublisherKatharine Graham.
The Postcould have survived under the company's ownership and been profitable for the foreseeable future," Graham stated, in an effort to explain the transaction.
But we wanted to do more than survive.
I'm not saying this guarantees success, but it gives us a much greater chance of success.
In a statement toPostemployees on August 5, Bezos wrote:"The values ofThe Postdo not need changing.
...There will, of course, be change atThe Postover the coming years.
That's essential and would have happened with or without new ownership.
The Internet is transforming almost every element of the news business: shortening news cycles, eroding long-reliable revenue sources, and enabling new kinds of competition, some of which bear little or no news-gathering costs.
Bezos hired hundreds of reporters and editors and tripled the newspaper's technology staff (hundreds of those employees published an open letter to their boss asking for salary increases and better benefits in the summer of 2018).
The organization boasted several scoops, includingrevealingthat former national security advisorMichael Flynnlied about his contact with Russians, leading to his resignation.By 2016, the organization said it was profitable.The following year, thePosthadan ad revenue of more than $100 million, with three straight years of double-digit revenue growth.
Amazon soon bypassedThe New York Timesdigital in unique users, with 86.4 million unique users as of June 2019, according to ComScore.Blue OriginIn 2000, Bezos foundedBlue Origin, an aerospace company that develops technologies to lower the cost of space travel to make it accessible to paying customers.
For a decade and a half, the company operated quietly.Then, in 2016, Bezos invited reporters to visit the headquarters in Kent, Washington, just south of Seattle.
He described a vision of humans not only visiting but eventually colonizing space.
In 2017, Bezos promised to sell about $1 billion in Amazon stock annually to fund Blue Origin.Two years later, he revealed the Blue Origin moon lander and said the company was conducting test flights of its suborbital New Shepard rocket, which would take tourists into space for a few minutes.“We are going to build a road to space.
And then amazing things will happen,” Bezos said.In August 2019,NASA announcedthat Blue Origin was among 13 companies selected to collaborate on 19 technology projects to reach the moon and Mars.
Blue Origin is developing a safe and precise landing system for the moon as well as engine nozzles for rockets with liquid propellant.
The companyis also working with NASAto build and launch reusable rockets from a refurbished complex just outside of NASA’s Kennedy Space Center.Bezos Day One FundIn 2018, Bezos launched the Bezos Day One Fund, which focuses on "funding existing non-profits that help homeless families, and creating a network of new, non-profit tier-one preschools in low-income communities."
The announcement came a year after Bezos had asked his Twitter followers how to donate part of his fortune.Bezos founded the organization with his ex-wife MacKenzie before their divorce, and he gave away $2 billion of his personal fortune to fund the nonprofit.
As one of the world's wealthiest people, Bezos had been publicly criticized in the past for his lack of philanthropic efforts.Healthcare VentureOn January 30, 2018, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase delivered a joint press release in which they announced plans to pool their resources to form a new healthcare company for their U.S. employees.According to the release, the company will be "free from profit-making incentives and constraints" as it tries to find ways to cut costs and boost satisfaction for patients, with an initial focus on technology solutions.
The healthcare system is complex, and we enter into this challenge open-eyed about the degree of difficulty," said Bezos.
Hard as it might be, reducing healthcare's burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort.
Earth FundOn February 17, 2020, Bezos announced that he was launching the Bezos Earth Fund to combat the potentially devastating effects of climate change.
Along with committing $10 billion to the initiative, Bezos said he would begin issuing grants and fund "scientists, activists, NGOs — any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world.
Stepping Down as CEOIn February 2021, Amazon announced that Bezos will step down as CEO in the third quarter of the year.
He will transition to executive chair of Amazon's board.Wife and KidsBezos met MacKenzie Tuttle when they both worked at D.E.
Shaw: he as a senior vice president and she as an administrative assistant to pay the bills to fund her writing career.
The couple dated for three months before getting engaged and married shortly thereafter in 1993.MacKenzie was an integral part of the founding and success of Amazon, helping create Amazon's first business plan and serving as the company's first accountant.
Although quiet and bookish, she publicly supported Amazon and her husband.
A novelist by trade, training underToni Morrisonduring her college years at Princeton University, MacKenzie published her first book,The Testing of Luther Albright, in 2005, and her second novel,Traps, in 2013.After more than 25 years of marriage, Bezos and MacKenzie divorced in 2019.
As part of the divorce settlement, Bezos' stake in Amazon was cut from 16 percent to 12 percent, putting his stake at nearly $110 billion and MacKenzie's at more than $37 billion.
MacKenzie announced that she planned to give away at least half of her wealth to charity.Bezos and MacKenzie have four children together: three sons and a daughter adopted from China.Personal LifeRight after Bezos announced his divorce from MacKenzie in January 2019,The National Enquirerpublished an 11-page exposé of the media mogul's extramarital affair with television host Lauren Sanchez.Bezos subsequently launched an investigation into the motives ofThe National Enquirerand its parent company, American Media Inc.
The following month, in a lengthy post on Medium, Bezos accused AMI of threatening to publish explicit photos unless he backed off the investigation.
Of course I don’t want personal photos published, but I also won't participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks and corruption," Bezos wrote.
I prefer to stand up, roll this log over and see what crawls out.
In that same post, Bezos suggested that there was possibly a link between AMI's actions and the Saudi Arabian government.
Later, a forensic analysis of Bezos' phone revealed that it was hacked after the mogul received a video via WhatsApp from Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Sanchez divorced her husband in April 2019.
She and Bezos made their first public appearance as a couple that July at Wimbledon.QUICK FACTSName:                                             Jeffrey Preston BezosBirth Year:                                             1964Birth date: January 12,                                             1964Birth State:                                             New MexicoBirth City:                                             AlbuquerqueBirth Country:                                             United StatesGender: MaleBest Known For: American entrepreneur Jeff Bezos is the founder and executive chairman of Amazon.com and owner of 'The Washington Post.'

Bezos, Jeff - Childhood Years, Early Innovator, Enters PrincetonToggle navigationEncyclopediaEncyclopedia of Small BusinessEncyclopedia of BusinessEncyclopedia of American IndustriesEncyclopedia of ManagementOtherBusiness PlansTrademark EncyclopediaHistoryBusiness BiographiesCompany HistoriesCompany Histories Part 2Leading American BusinessesForumHomeLeading American BusinessesA-FBezos, JeffJeff BezosBorn: January 12, 1964Albuquerque, New MexicoFounder and CEO,Amazon.comJeff Bezos.Reproduced by permission of the Corbis Corporation (Bellevue).E-commerce is indeed getting a lot of attention and at its center is Jeff
      Bezos (pronounced bay-zohs), founder, chief executive office (CEO), and
      head cheerleader forAmazon.com, the Internet bookselling company he founded in 1995.
With about $1
      million in capital, most borrowed from friends and family, Bezos built a
      multibillion-dollar empire in about five years and in doing so,
      revolutionized the way commerce is done on the Internet.Childhood YearsJeffrey Preston Bezos was born January 12, 1964, in Albuquerque, New
      Mexico.
A year later, his parents divorced and since then he has never had
      contact with his biological father.
Three years later, his mother, Jackie
      Gise, married Michael Bezos, who fled his native Cuba when he was fifteen
      years old.
In early 1996 we were called Amazon.con, in '97
        Amazon.toast, and in 1999 it was Amazon.bomb.
Then there was my personal
        favorite:Amazon.org, because clearly we're not for profit.… It still gets a
        ton of attention.
I mean, you're still talking to me.
Much of Jeff Bezos's relentless drive and ambition likely came from
      his new father, who was raised in a Catholic mission.
Mike Bezos always
      strove to better himself, learning English
       and working various odd jobs to pay for his education at the University
      of New Mexico at Albuquerque.
After college, he became an engineer with
      Exxon Corporation, causing the family to move to Texas.
After several
      years, another job transfer brought them to Florida, where Jeff Bezos
      attended Palmetto High School in Miami.
Bezos was popular in school and
      became class president and valedictorian in his senior year.Early InnovatorBezos always had a knack for figuring out how things work.
InJeff Bezos: King of Amazon,author Josepha Sherman writes, "From the time he was a toddler,
      Bezos was busy trying to change his world.
He felt he was too old to sleep
      in a 'baby' crib, so he found a screwdriver and took the
      crib apart.
Instead of getting mad, Bezos's family encouraged
      him.
Bezos had a younger sister, Christina, and brother, Mark.
When the young
      siblings learned to walk, they loved going into their brother's
      room because of all the fascinating "toys".
To warn him that
      the children were coming, Jeff attached an alarm to his bedroom door that
      made a loud buzzing sound when someone entered.When Bezos was twelve he wanted something called an Infinity Cube.
The
      device was a set of small motorized mirrors that reflected off one another
      so the images seemed to go on endlessly.
It cost $20 but Bezos did not
      have enough money to buy it.
Instead, he purchased mirrors and other parts
      with what money he had and constructed his own reflecting cube.
He built
      other inventions, including amateur robots.
At one point he had so much
      clutter in his bedroom, his parents made him move all of his half-finished
      devices and experiments into the garage.There are many similar stories surrounding Bezos's childhood years.
      He spent countless hours building models and an assortment of electronics
      kits.
He worked on science projects, often coming up with his own
      "inventions."
By the time he reached high school, he had
      turned the family garage into his personal science and electronics
      laboratory.
Ironically, Bezos later would launchAmazon.comfrom his own garage.Enters PrincetonAfter graduating with honors from high school, Bezos decided to follow in
      the footsteps of Stephen Hawking and enroll in the physics program at
      Princeton University.
He soon realized, however, that the subject was too
      difficult for him, so he switched to a double major in electronics and
      computer science.
Bezos discovered he excelled at creating software
      programs.
In 1986, he graduated with highest honors and Phi Beta Kappa
      (membership in a national honor society), earning degrees in electrical
      engineering and the still new field of computer science.Bezos turned down several job offers from large corporations and instead
      took a position with a newly formed fiber optic company, Fitel.
His task
      was to help the company build a computer network specifically for
      international finance.
In 1988, he took a job developing systems for
      managing investment funds at Banker's Trust in New York City.
After
      two years, he moved to the Wall Street investment firm of D. E. Shaw
      & Company as a computer specialist.
In 1992, at age twenty-eight,
      he became Shaw's youngest ever vice president; two years later he
      was promoted to senior vice president.Bezos and DisneyAt various times, Jeff Bezos dreamed of becoming a cowboy or an
        astronaut.
He was a devotedStar Trekfan and went as far as naming his dog Kamala after a minor character
        from an episode ofStar Trek: The Next Generation.His heroesincluded American inventor Thomas Edison(1847-1931), astrophysicist Stephen Hawking (1942-), andWalt Disney(see entry), although he was no Mickey Mouse fan.
Instead, he was
        fascinated with how Disney came up with the electronics and animatronics
        used in Disney World in Orlando, Florida.
The thing that always amazed me [about Disney] was how powerful
        his vision was," Bezos said in aTimearticle.
He knew exactly what he wanted to build and teamed up
        with a bunch of really smart people and built it.
Everyone thought it
        wouldn't work, and he had to persuade the banks to lend him $400
        million.
But he did it."
Many friendsandfamily members would likely say the same thing about Bezos and the way
        he tookAmazon.comfrom an idea to a multibillion-dollar enterprise.
Bezos, however, did
        it much quicker than Disney.From Idea to RealityWhile at Shaw Bezos developed the idea that would eventually becomeAmazon.com.
In 1994, he read an article about how the World Wide Web was growing by
      2,300 percent a year.
He knew he had to tap into such a great potential
      for commerce but was unsure what type of business would work
       best.
He researched mail-order companies, believing their products would
      sell well on the Internet.
After drawing up a list of twenty popular
      mail-order items, Bezos finally settled on books since the millions of
      titles in print offered an enormous potential for sales.On July 6,1995, Bezos launchedAmazon.com, named after the South American river, with financial and moral support
      from family and friends.
The company operated out of the garage of the
      Bezos's two-bedroom home in suburban Seattle, Washington.
With
      almost no publicity, sales took off immediately.
Within the first
      few days, I knew this was going to be huge," Bezos toldTime.
It was obvious that we were onto something much bigger than we
      ever dared to hope.
Person of the YearBy the end of 1999,Amazon.comhad become a multibillion-dollar corporation offering 3.5 million titles
      for sale.
It had expanded into a variety of other merchandise, including
      music and videos, and had set up operations in Europe.
Bezos's
      personal fortune alone was estimated at $10.5 billion.
In the crowning
      achievement of his career,Timemagazine named Bezos its "Person of the Year" for 1999,
      proclaiming him king of cybercommerce.With success came adversity.
The company became involved in several
      notable lawsuits filed by Barnes & Noble and Wal-Mart.
But none of
      the problems compared to the biggest challenge of all: making the company
      profitable.Amazon.comlost money every year, including $1.4 billion in 2000.
In 2001, the
      company laid off thirteen hundred workers and instituted other
      cost-cutting measures.
The belt-tightening worked andAmazon.composted its first ever net profit of $5.1 million for the fourth quarter
      of 2001.Despite his hectic schedule, the head of the world's largest
        bookstore still finds time to read.
Jeff Bezos buys about ten books a
        month although he reads only three.
His favorites includeThe Remains of the Dayby Kazuo Ishiguro,Duneby Frank Herbert, andBuilt to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companiesby James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras.For the future, Bezos plans to makeAmazon.coma place people can buy anything they want on-line.
And now that theCEO and founder Jeff Bezos is known for his sunny disposition and
            booming laugh.Reproduced by permission of the Corbis Corporation (Bellevue).company is firmly rooted, Bezos and his wife MacKenzie want to turn their
      attention to charitable work.
At some point, we want to figure out
      how to do philanthropic work that's highly leveraged," said
      Bezos.
It's very easy to give away money ineffectively.
But
      doing it well requires at least as much attention and energy as building a
      successful company.

Word of mouth is very powerful.”“In business, what’s dangerous is not to evolve.”“The common question that gets asked in business is, ‘why?’ That’s a good question, but an equally valid question is, ‘why not?’”About building a brand“A brand for a company is like a reputation for a person.

It just works.”“A company shouldn’t get addicted to being shiny, because shiny doesn’t last.”I think frugality drives innovation just like other constraints do.

Jeff Bezos has also been known to have very adventurous taste buds.
He has eaten dishes that include insects.You can read more below about what dishes are in Thai cuisine, as well as other foods Bezos has been seen indulging in before.What Is Thai Food?As mentioned above, Thai food comes from the Southeast Asian country known as Thailand.It is also thefavorite of Amazon’s CEO, Jeff Bezos.
Although many people think that Thai food is deep-fried, stir-fry, or steamed dishes, those are all characteristics of Chinese cuisine on Thai.
Thai dishes focus on light cooking.What Personality Type Is Jeff Bezos?What Was Jeff Bezos’ SAT Score?Is Jeff Bezos Self-Made?As Thai food veteran and chef, David Thompson,put it“Thai food ain’t about simplicity.
It’s about the juggling of disparate elements to create a harmonious finish.
Like a complex musical chord, it’s got to have a smooth surface but it doesn’t matter what’s happening underneath.”Thai dishes are generally split intofour different sections.
They would be boiled dishes, spicy salads, pounded foods, and curries.
Some examples ofThai dishesthat you may have tried yourself are pad Thai, tom yam goong, green curry, massaman curry, Thai glass noodle salad, mu nam tok, and Thai fried rice.In 2019, CNN Travel ranked Thailand as number 8 on its list ofWhich Country Has the Best Food?Click on the below YouTube link to watchBest Ever Food Review Show’s video where they try eating bugs in Thailand!Warning though, you might get a little grossed out by it.Jeff Bezos Eats BugsIf you know anything about Thai cuisine, you know thatinsects are a very popular dishamong locals.
More adventurous tourists to Thailand often try thedishes that use bugsif they find themselves on the super popular Khao San Road in Bangkok.Since Jeff Bezos is a big Thai food lover, it doesn’t seem all that shocking that he has eaten bugs before.
He didn’t do so in Thailand though.In 2014, while attending The Explorers Club’s annual dinner, Jeff Bezos wasspotted eating a cockroach.
You read that correctly: a cockroach.
Bezos is a reported member of the famous club that was founded in 1904 by Henry Collins Walsh.Themission of The Explorers Clubwas “to form an organization to unite explorers in the bonds of good fellowship and to promote the work of exploration by every means in its power.”With his efforts with his companyBlue Originand space exploration, it sounds like Bezos fits right in.Bezos Eats Lizard Meat TooBezos hasn’t only eaten cockroach through The Explorers Club annual meetings.
In 2018, he attended the yearly gathering at the Waldorf Astoria and waspictured eating iguana.Some people might be a little freaked out by the notion of eating lizard meat, but it was for a good reason.As was put inthis Gizmodo article“Fixing problems on our home planet has inspired one of the dinner’s most notable features.
Each year, a master chef cooks up a menu comprised of invasive species to highlight ways in which our diets could be more sustainable.
This go-round featured tarantula, cockroach and roasted iguana.”While iguana is not something that is eaten in Thailand, it has becomea dish in Puerto Ricowhere the green lizard is running amuck.The species has also made its way into Florida where it is becoming a big problem.
However, it wasn’t a problem at all for Bezos to try eating the green monster.AboutCelebrity Name List (A-Z)ContactPrivacy PolicyAdvertise© 2020 Black Sands Media - All Rights ReservedNo ResultView All ResultHomeAboutCelebrity ListContactAdvertiseOur SitesLuxuryViewerHistoryAnswers© 2020 Black Sands Media - All Rights Reserved

Critics have chided Bezos for not signing theGiving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.Video Ad FeedbackExclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now01:50- Source:CNNIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”Asked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”Bezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.The 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and apossible economic recessionto Sánchez’s plan tovisit outer spacewith an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.Dolly PartonThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a$100 million grant to Partonas part of her Courage and Civility Award.
It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate andCNN contributor Van Jones.Getty ImagesDolly Parton receives $100 million Courage and Civility Award from Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right?
She is just beaming with light.
And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds.
And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”The throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.Unity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.How to give it awayBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune.
Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.Despite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to theBloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.Bezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs.
Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.Jose Andres, Jeff Bezos, Van Jones.Blue OriginBezos donates $100 million each to CNN contributor Van Jones and chef Jose AndresThough Bezos is now Amazon’s(AMZN)executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company.
Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s(AMZN)footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom.
Amazon’s(AMZN)reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.Bezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return.
It’s not easy.
Building Amazon was not easy.
It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added.
So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”Bezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recentlygave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizationsin the span of less than a year.The economic downturnWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.Last month, Bezostweeteda warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”Ringo H.W.
Chiu/AP/Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images'Batten down the hatches': Bezos and fellow billionaires are issuing recession warningsThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said.
Keep some dry powder on hand….
Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems.
You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”Many may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.Bezos and Sánchez’s partnershipSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said.
Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”Sánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot.
She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.Bezos has creditedhis own journey to spacefor helping to inspire his push to fight climate change.
Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.Sánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023.
And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”Washington’s NFL teamGetty ImagesJay-Z and Jeff Bezos are interested in buying the Washington Commanders togetherBezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume.
CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potentialjoint bid on the Washington Commanders.It is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.But during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.Sánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football.
I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”Bezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”– CNN’s Chloe Melas contributed to this reportRelatedAd FeedbackMore from CNN BusinessLucy Nicholson/ReutersCommercial real estate is in trouble.

Bezos has some counsel for American during a recession.Charlie Riedel, Associated PressMany are inclined to spend a pretty penny during the end-of-the-year holiday sales, but billionaire Jeff Bezos has advice for shoppers this year.When asked if consumers should “batten down the hatches” with the looming recession, the Amazon CEO gave a serious warning in an interview withCNNon Saturday.“My advice to people ... is take some risk off the table,” Bezossaid.“If you’re an individual and you’re thinking about buying a new large screen TV, maybe slow that down,” he added.
Keep that cash, see what happens.

Skip to: Start of Article.Author: Geek's Guide to the Galaxy.Geek's Guide to the GalaxyCultureDate of Publication: 01.26.19.01.26.19Time of Publication: 8:50 am.8:50 amHowStarTrekand Sci-Fi Influenced Jeff BezosJeff Bezos named his dog after aStar Trekcharacter.Franziska Krug/Getty ImagesJeff Bezos is a lifelong science fiction fan.
As a child the Amazon founder spent his summers reading Asimov and Heinlein, and according to Christian Davenport, who profiled Bezos in his bookThe Space Barons, he’s a hardcoreStar Trekfan.“He named his dog Kamala, after one of the characters, and one of his holding companies is Zefram LLC, named for the character inStar Trekwho created the warp drive,” Davenport says in Episode 345 of theGeek’s Guide to the Galaxypodcast.
He even had a cameo in one of theStar Trekfilms.
So that’s obviously a huge influence on him.”Podcasthttps://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/geeksguide345final.mp3RSSiTunesDownloadScience fiction also played a role in the creation ofBlue Origin, the rocket company that Bezos founded in 2000.
The year before, Bezos had watched the movieOctober Sky, about NASA engineer Homer Hickam, with science fiction authorNeal Stephenson.
Afterward they were discussing the film.“[Jeff] says to Neal Stephenson, ‘I’ve always wanted to start a rocket company, that’s always been my dream,'” Davenport says.
And Neal Stephenson just said, ‘Do it.
Do it today.’ And soon thereafter, he did.”Despite his busy schedule, Bezos still makes time to read new science fiction from writers such as Alastair Reynolds, Ernest Cline, and Andy Weir.
I got the sense that that’s important to him, to sort of nourish his mind,” Davenport says.
So he definitely tries to keep up on that stuff.”Bezos has also moved to acquire more science fiction for Amazon’s streaming service.
Novels by Iain Banks, Larry Niven, and Neal Stephenson are all in development, and last spring Amazon savedThe Expanseafter it was canceled by Syfy.“Something that [Jeff] wants to do is not just to have success in space—to make rockets that are reusable—but to reinvigorate interest in space,” Davenport says.
And I thought savingThe Expansewas a great way to do that.”Listen to the complete interview with Christian Davenport in Episode 345 ofGeek’s Guide to the Galaxy(above).
And check out some highlights from the discussion below.Christian Davenport on interviewing Jeff Bezos:“What I found in the archives was the press release from when Jeff’s grandfather left ARPA to go back to work at the Atomic Energy Commission, and the press release had a picture of his grandfather on it—a very big picture.
And so I saw him a few months later and handed him the press release, which he had never seen—and I could see the expression on his face—and I just said, ‘I’m putting my cards on the table.
I’m writing this book, and I’m just really trying to impress you with the level of research I’m doing.’ And then I thought I had him, and he said, ‘I’m inclined to participate.’ Then it took another couple of months of working with his people to get on the schedule, but then I did.”Related StoriesGeek's Guide to the GalaxyBeing a Hollywood Science Consultant Isn’t Exactly GlamorousGeek's Guide to the GalaxyDoctorWhoIs Reaching a Whole New AudienceGeek's Guide to the GalaxySci-Fi Writers Are Grappling With a Post-Trump RealityChristian Davenport on the future:“[Jeff] gives this stump speech about how we shouldgo out to space to preserve Earth, and today the line he says is, ‘Earth should be zoned residential,’ that Earth is this really magnificent place, with waterfalls and palm trees and snow and bacon and wine and whiskey, and all these wonderful things, and that other planets—like Mars, for example—which is whereElon Muskwants to go, are really desolate, and hard places to live.
 So that’s what he talks about today, but when he was 18 years old and giving a speech at his high school, it was virtually the same speech, but instead of saying ‘Earth should be zoned residential’ he said ‘Earth should be preserved as a National Park.’ So obviously this is something he’s been thinking about for a very long time.”Christian Davenport on Blue Origin:“[Jeff] turned to me and he said, ‘Do you know how a bullwhip works?’ And I was like, ‘What do you mean?’ And he said, ‘Well, that crack, there’s a mini sonic boom in there.
You can get the whip to go faster than the speed of sound just with your arm, and the way that works is that momentum is mass times velocity, and so as your mass decreases—toward the end of the whip—your velocity has to increase.’ And so I’m digesting that and letting it sink in, and then I’m like, ‘So you were going to bullwhip people into space?’ And he’s like, ‘Well, no, no, no.
Not people.
But maybe satellites or cargo, and things like that.’ But they could see that this was an idea that wasn’t going to work.”Christian Davenport on the space industry:“What I’ve noticed, just in reporting this over the last five years, is how the investment community is becoming more interested in space.
I think early on space investors were the space geeks, they were the enthusiasts, they were more interested in the dream than they were perhaps in the return on investment.
But now you’ve seen more players get into this.
I mean, the fact that Google and Fidelity invested a billion dollars intoSpaceXshould tell you something, and the fact that companies like Morgan Stanley are talking about it.
Whereas they used to say, ‘The quickest way to become a millionaire in space is to start out as a billionaire,’ now I think people are starting to believe that you can actually make money in space.”More Great WIRED StoriesWeedmaps’ grip on the high-flying Californiapot marketHave phones become boring?

However, it is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team.In an exclusive interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas this weekend, the billionaire businessman was asked if he was seeking to buy the team.“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smirk.Bezos pointed out that he “grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid.”“It is my favorite sport,” he said in the interview.
So we’ll just have to wait and see.”A House Oversight Committee investigating Snyder accused the current Commanders owner of fostering a “toxic workplace” and conducting “a shadow investigation to target his accusers, pin the blame on others, and influence the NFL’s own internal review.” Snyder has denied the accusations but isconsidering a sale of the team.The NFL fined the Commanders $10 million following an internal investigation by attorney Beth Wilkinson last year.Jeff Bezos and Lauren SanchezCNNExclusive: Jeff Bezos says he will give most of his money to charityWhy would Bezos want to own the Commanders?
The team is one of the most notable franchises in one of the most popular sports leagues in the world.
The Commanders have won three Super Bowls (in 1983, 1988 and 1992) and is located in the giant Washington, DC, market.The NFL is the biggest ratings powerhouse on American TV andhas been a hit for Amazon Prime Video, which is the exclusive home to “Thursday Night Football.”Jay Marine, Prime Video’s head of sports, wrote in an internal memo in September that the debut “exceeded all of our expectations for viewership” and led to “the biggest three hours for US Prime sign ups ever in the history of Amazon.”– CNN’s Chloe Melas and David Close contributed to this report.RelatedAd FeedbackMore from CNN BusinessLucy Nicholson/ReutersCommercial real estate is in trouble.

The franchise that has caught Bezos’ eye is reportedly the Washington Commanders.
Bezos owns The Washington Post, so his interest in the Commanders makes sense.When current Washington ownerDaniel Snyder recently hired Bank of America to “explore potential transactions,” the Bezos rumors went into overdrive.Jay Glazer of FOX Sports reported Snyder’s intentionis a complete sale of the franchise.In a recent interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas, Bezos was asked about the buzz of potentially adding NFL owner to his resume.“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said while laughing.
Bezos’ partner, Lauren Sanchez spoke up and said, “I do like football.
I am just going to throw that out there for everyone,” she said.Bezos laughed and offered the following response.“There’s not much I can say about that right now, but she does like football.”Melas then asked Bezos if owning a professional sports team was always a part of his dream.“Well, I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid,” Bezos said.
It is my favorite sport; we’ll just have to wait and see.”After Bezos spoke, Sanchez chimed in again, “Once again, I do like football.”Will@JeffBezosbuy the Washington@Commanders?He was asked about it during a@cnninterview.pic.twitter.com/RDzWMWlNwx— Scott Abraham (@Scott7news)November 14, 2022Bezos is one of the multiple names with a reported interest in the Commanders.
There is a rumored partnership with millionaire music mogul Jay-Z as the two prepare a bid for the Washington NFL franchise.You can say a lot without saying a thing.
And that’s what Bezos did in this interview.
His words — or lack of words —combined with Sanchez’s “love” of football, tell you he plans to make a serious run at buying the Commanders.Story originally appeared on Commanders WireTRENDING1.Kyle Anderson says he and Rudy Gobert have 'hashed it out' after fight during timeout2.NFL Draft hopeful Michael Jefferson seriously injured in fatal Alabama car crash3.

He is currently the richest man in the world.But Bezos hasn't always been the billionaire titan he is today.
He was born the son of a 16-year-old mom and deadbeat dad.
And he didn't set out to be the CEO of an e-commerce juggernaut.
I won the lottery with my mom.
Thanks for literally everything, Mom"Jeff Bezos was born on January 12, 1964, as Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen.
His biological dad, Ted Jorgensen, met and started dating his mother, Jacklyn Gise, when they were both in high school.
Jorgensen was 18 and Gise was 16 when she became pregnant.
They flew to Mexico with their parents' money to get married.Jorgensen belonged to a unicycle troupe and worked at a retail store making $1.25 an hour, so he didn't have much money.
He was also "had a habit of drinking too much," according to"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon," by journalist and biographer Brad Stone.
When Jeff Bezos was 17 months old, his mom divorced Jorgensen.In 1968, Gise remarried Miguel Bezos, who arrived in Miami in 1962 from Cuba knowing only one word of English: "hamburger."
Jorgensen agreed to let Bezos adopt his son and, at 4 years old, Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen became Jeffrey Preston Bezos.Biographer Stone suggests that Bezos' childhood may have contributed to his obsession with success.
It is of course unknowable whether the unusual circumstances of his birth helped to create that fecund entrepreneurial mix of intelligence, ambition, and a relentless need to prove himself.
Two other technology icons, Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison, were adopted, and the experience is thought by some to have given each a powerful motivation to succeed," Stone writes.Growing up, Bezos spent summers with his grandparents on their Texas ranch,he says in the commencement speechhe gave at Princeton in 2010.
I helped fix windmills, vaccinate cattle, and do other chores.
We also watched soap operas every afternoon, especially 'Days of our Lives,'" said Bezos.Bezos would also occasionally get to road trip with his grandparents.
My grandparents belonged to a Caravan Club, a group of Airstream trailer owners who travel together around the U.S. and Canada.
And every few summers, we'd join the caravan,"Bezos said in graduation speech.
We'd hitch up the Airstream trailer to my grandfather's car, and off we'd go, in a line with 300 other Airstream adventurers.
I loved and worshipped my grandparents and I really looked forward to these trips.
Launching Amazon: "I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice"Bezos got straight As in high school, was the valedictorian of his class and was accepted early admission to Princeton, according to Stone's biography.
For a time in college,he thought he would be a theoretical physicist.But it was years later, while working in finance in New York City that he had the idea to start Amazon.
I came across the fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year.
I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles — something that simply couldn't exist in the physical world — was very exciting to me," said Bezos, in his 2010 Princeton address.At the time, Bezos was just 30 and had been married for a year.
I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go do this crazy thing that probably wouldn't work since most startups don't, and I wasn't sure what would happen after that," he said.After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.Jeff Bezosfounder of Amazon, Blue OriginHis wife told him to go for it.
As a young boy,I'd been a garage inventor.
I'd invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker that didn't work very well out of an umbrella and tinfoil, baking-pan alarms to entrap my siblings," he said.
I'd always wanted to be an inventor, and she wanted me to follow my passion.
But not everyone was on board.
Bezos boss took a walk through Central Park and told Bezos that, while it sounded like a "really good idea," it would be an even better idea for somebody who didn't already have a good career.
That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision,"said Bezos.
Seen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot.
I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing.
And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all.
After much consideration,I took the less safe pathto follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.
The early days of Amazon: "I thought maybe one day we would be able to afford a forklift"When Amazon first started, it sold only books.
Bezos would drive the packages to the post office himselfin his 1987 Chevy Blazer.
I thought maybe one day we would be able to afford a forklift,"Bezos told Charlie Rosein a wide-ranging interview in 2016.
And it is very, it's very, very different today.
After books, the next items Bezos added to Amazon were music and videos.
Then, he asked customers to see what else they would want to buy from the online retailer.
I sent an email message out to the customer base, actually a thousand randomly selected customers, and I said, besides books, music and video, what would you like to see us sell?
And the list came back incredibly long," explained Bezos.
It was basically just whatever the person had on their mind right now," said Bezos, and that sparked an idea.VIDEO1:0501:05Here's what makes up the Jeff Bezos empireThe Definitive Guide to Business"One of customers said, 'I wish you sold windshield wipers because I need windshield wipers for my car.'
A light kind of went on in my head.
You know, people — people will want to use this new fangled e-commerce way of shopping for everything,"Bezos told Rose.
People are very convenience-motivated," says Bezos.
So that really started the kind of the expansion into all categories, consumer electronics, and then apparel, and so on.
Expand he did.
Today, Amazon sells almost everything.
From toilet paperto groceriesto electronics to fashion to furniture.When Bezos enters a new product category, he is not intimidated by a lack of expertise.
I am never disappointed when we're not good at something because I think, well think how good it's going to work when we are good at it,"Bezos told Rose.
And the apparel is like that.
There is so much opportunity.
Nobody really knows how to do a great job of offering — apparel online yet.
And we have tons of invention and ideas and working our way through that experimental list.
Amazon's North star: "Customer obsession, as opposed to competitor obsession"Bezos has always been a rare combination of optimistic, idealistic and visionary.Back in 2003, while much of the tech industry was still hungover from the dot-com bust, Bezos was aggressively foretelling the potential of the Internet.
I do think there's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us,"said Bezos in a TED Talkhe gave that year.
We're very, very early.
As Bezos charged full force into the Wild West that was the Internet then, he was — and still is today — guided by a single belief: Do what is best for the customer.
Thing that connects everything that Amazon does is the No.
1 — our No.
1 conviction and idea and philosophy and principle which is customer obsession, as opposed to competitor obsession.
And so we are always focused on the customer, working backwards from the customer's needs, developing new skills internally so that we can satisfy what we perceive to be future customer needs,"Bezos told Rose.Another through line to Bezos' business strategy is his "willingness to think long-term," he says.
We are very happy to invest in new initiatives that are very risky, for five to seven years, which most companies won't do that,"Bezos told Rose.
It's the combination of the risk-taking and the long-term outlook that make Amazon, not unique, but special in a smaller crowd.
Finally, he's obsessive about finding problems and fixing them.
Taking real pride in operational excellence, so just doing things well, finding defects and working backwards — that is all the incremental improvement that in business, most successful companies are very good at this one.
... [Y]ou don't want to ever let defects flow downstream,"Bezos said to Rose.
That is a key part of doing a good job in any business in my opinion.
VIDEO0:5100:51The evolution of Jeff Bezos: See if you can recognize him through the yearsDigital OriginalFrom e-commerce to mediaAs consumer behavior on the web has evolved, so, too has Amazon.

One of Amazon's most popular shows, "Transparent," for instance, was about a patriarch who becomes a woman later in life.
It won eight Emmys before being cancelled a season after star Jeffrey Tambor was accused of harassment and ousted.But a show like "Transparent" wouldn't have been possible at all on broadcast TV because it needs a huge audience there to be successful, Bezos toldRosein 2016.
Y]ou can actually think about the creative process a little differently.
You can attract different storytellers.
You can go for stories that are narrower but incredibly powerful and well told.
In addition to producing online shows, Bezos is also the owner of another kind of content: journalism.
Through his Nash Holdings LLC, hebought the Washington Postin 2013 for $250 million.
I bought it because it's important," said Bezos.
I would never buy a financially upside down salty snack food company.
You know, that doesn't make any sense to me.
But The Washington Post is important.
And so it makes sense to me to take something like that, and I also am optimistic.
And I thought there were some ways to make it — I want it to be a self-sustaining, profitable enterprise," Bezos told Rose.
And I think it can be done.
Bezos' empire now stretches far and wide.
Amazonbought Whole Foods in2017 and also owns companies like Zappos and Twitch.
ThroughBezos Expeditions, he's also invested in companies like Twitter and Basecamp,among many others.The final frontier: "I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5"While shipping toiletries and downloading books hasmade Bezos wealthy, his passion is outer space.Buzz Aldrin dropped by Blue Origin HQ to say hi to the team yesterday.
This is a childhood dream,"Bezos told Rose.
I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5 years old.
I watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon.
You don't choose your passions, your passions choose you.
So I am infected with this idea.
I couldn't ever stop thinking about space.
I have been thinking about it ever since then.
To that end, Bezos is the founder ofBlue Origin, a company that aims tomake space tourism affordable.
Basically what I am doing right now is taking my Amazon winnings and investing them.
Every time you see me sell stock on Amazon, it's send more money to the Blue Origin team,"Bezos told Rose.In addition to making it possible for more people to travel to space, Bezos says he is building the infrastructure for the next generation of space entrepreneurs.
I]f I'm 80 years old, looking back on my life and the one thing I have done is make it so that there is this gigantic entrepreneurial explosion in space for the next generation," said Bezos, "I will be a happy, happy man.

It symobilizes a website link url.Copy LinkRead in appRedeem nowJeff BezosReutersThe last time Jeff Bezos, the 49-year-old CEO and founder of Amazon, saw his biological father, he was three years old.His biological father, whose name is Ted Jorgensen, was 18 when he impregnated Bezos' mother, Jacklyn Gise, who herself was 17.
They were both still in high school at the time.
They got married before their son was born.The marriage lasted only 17 months,reports Brad Stone at Bloomberg Businessweek, who has unearthed astonishing new details about Bezos' family's early years.Gise moved in with her parents becauseJorgensen stayed out late, and drank too much, and was generally an inattentive father and husband says Stone.
He agreed to a divorce, and paid a small amount of child support to Gise when he had money.
Other times he missed the payments.Three years after their divorce, Gise married another man, Miguel Bezos, a Cuban immigrant who taught himself English, and eventually worked at Exxon.
Miguel adopted Jeff, and Jeff took his last name.
Jorgensen had to sign off on the name change, which he did, Stone reports.For a brief period Jorgensen remembered the Bezos name, but through the years he forgot about it, and dropped completely out of touch with his ex-wife and his son.Jorgensen's absence from Bezos' life was so complete that ina 1999 interview with Wired, Bezos said of Jorgensen, "I've never met him," although, in reality he lived with him for the first year of his life.
The reality, as far as I'm concerned, is that my Dad is my natural father.
The only time I ever think about it, genuinely, is when a doctor asks me to fill out a form," said Bezos in 1999.Jorgensen, for his part, had a nearly identical attitude about Bezos.However, Stone managed to find Jorgensen, now 69, who owns a bike shop in Glendale, Arizona.Here's how Jorgensen reacted when Stone introduced himself: "He had no idea what I was talking about.
Jorgensen said he didn’t know who Jeff Bezos was and was baffled by my suggestion that he was the father of this famous CEO.
Stone jogged Jorgensen's memory, trotting out details about Bezos and his mother.
Says Stone, "The old man’s face flushed with recognition.
Is he still alive?'
he asked, not yet fully comprehending.
Bezos' biological father had disconnected so thoroughly from Bezos life that not only did he not remember his name, and not only did he not realize his son was one of the richest men in the world, but he wasn't even sure if his son was still alive.Jorgensen says that in his younger days "I wasn’t a good father or a husband."
He eventually quit drinking, got his act together and opened his bike shop.
He's married, but had no other children in his life beyond Bezos.A family friend told Stone later that Jorgensen felt overwhelmed with sadness and regret.
He wants to get in touch with Bezos, but it's unclear if that will ever happen.Stone has a book coming out about Amazon.It's excerpted at Bloomberg BusinessWeek.
