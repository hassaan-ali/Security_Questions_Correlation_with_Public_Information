This is a childhood dream,"Bezos says to Rose.
I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5 years old.
I watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon.
You don't choose your passions, your passions choose you.
So I am infected with this idea.
I couldn't ever stop thinking about space.
I have been thinking about it ever since then.
To that end, Bezos is the founder ofBlue Origin, a company that aims tomake space tourism affordable.
Basically what I am doing right now is taking my Amazon winnings and investing them.
Every time you see me sell stock on Amazon, it's send more money to the Blue Origin team,"Bezos says to Rose.In addition to making it possible for more people to travel to space, Bezos says he is building the infrastructure for the next generation of space entrepreneurs.
I]f I'm 80 years old, looking back on my life and the one thing I have done is make it so that there is this gigantic entrepreneurial explosion in space for the next generation," says Bezos, "I will be a happy, happy man.

We can now add Bezos’s reading list to similar ones fromSteve JobsandBill Gates.The Remains of the day, by Kazuo IshiguroJeff Bezos’s favorite novel, about a butler who wistfully recalls his career in service during wartime Great Britain.
Bezos has said he learns more from novels than nonfiction.Sam Walton: Made in America, by Sam WaltonIn his autobiography, Walmart’s founder expounds on the principles of discount retailing and discusses his core values of frugality and a bias for action—a willingness to try a lot of things and make many mistakes.
Bezos included both in Amazon’s corporate values.Memos from the Chairman, by Alan GreenbergA collection of memos to employees by the chairman of the now defunct investment bank Bear Stearns.
In his memos, Greenberg is constantly restating the bank’s core values, especially modesty and frugality.

The book lays out the theory behind Amazon’s two pizza teams.Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies, by Jim CollinsThe famous management book about why certain companies succeed over time.
A core ideology guides these firms, and only those employees who embrace the central mission flourish; others are “expunged like a virus” from the companies.Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap … and Others Don’t, by Jim CollinsCollins briefed Amazon executives on his seminal management book before its publication.
Companies must confront the brutal facts of their business, find out what they are uniquely good at, and master their fly wheel, in which each part of the business reinforces and accelerates the other parts.Creation: Life and How to make it, By Steve GrandA video-game designer argues that intelligent systems can be created from the bottom up if one devises a set of primitive building blocks.
The book was influential in the creation of Amazon Web Services, or AWS, the service that popularized the notion of the cloud.The Innovator’s Dilemma, by Clayton ChristensenAn enormously influential business book whose principles Amazon acted on and that facilitated the creation of the Kindle and AWS.
Some companies are reluctant to embrace disruptive technology because it might alienate customers and undermine their core business, but Christensen argues that ignoring potential disruption is even costlier.The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvements, by Eliyahu GoldrattAn exposition of the science of manufacturing written in the guise of the novel, the book encourages companies to identify the biggest constraints in their operations and then structure their organizations to get the most out of those constraints.

Born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1964, Bezos remembers watching Neil Armstrong land on the moon in 1969.
I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5 years old," Bezostells Charlie Rose.
I watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon.
I — so I am infected with this idea.
Jeff Bezos, founder and Ceo of AmazonPaul Souders | Getty ImagesBezos also remembers going through a phase in first grade when he was 6, where he wanted to be an archaeologist — because he had learned how to spell the word,according to a 2001 Guardian article.Later, Bezos was his high school's valedictorian, and then he went to Princeton, where he thought he would become a theoretical physicist.
That didn't stick either, though.
I was doing well, but it was so much work for me, it was hard and there were half a dozen people in my class who were so gifted, and their brains were just wired in a different way, and the things that I worked so hard to do came so effortlessly to them," says Bezos in the Guardian.I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5 years old.Jeff Bezosfounder of Amazon, Blue OriginThe experience was humbling for Bezos, who had previously far excelled easily.
I would say it was a combination of shocking and awe inspiring.
It was sort of, 'Wow, this is incredible that some people can process these incredibly abstract concepts so gracefully'...
So anyway, I realized that I was going to be a mediocre theoretical physicist... Mediocre theoretical physicists make no progress.
They spend all their time understanding other people's progress.
When he decided to let go of his theoretical physicist dreams, Bezos switched his major to computer science, according to a 1999 feature fromWired.
After college, Bezos worked for several years in finance, including at hedge fund D. E. Shaw, where he had the idea to sell books over the Internet, according to the Wired feature.The rest is history: Books became books and movies and music.
And soon the e-commerce platform added more wares to its roster.
Today, with amarket cap of about $500 billion, Amazon sells almost everything imaginable including groceries, toilet paper and furniture.And though Bezos has become a billionaire 90 times over thanks to e-commerce, he's still a space-junkie at heart.
Basically what I am doing right now is taking my Amazon winnings and investing them,"Bezos says to Rose.
Every time you see me sell stock on Amazon, it's send more money to the Blue Origin team.

Ltd.Published May 4, 2022+ FollowSummary: Sometimes pearls of wisdom can help you in building a great life.
Draw some inspiration from these five quotes by Jeff Bezos.In this digital world, the name of Jeff Bezos needs no introduction.
The CEO and founder of Amazon is a popular figure.
During the pandemic, when most businesses were facing shutdowns, Amazon flourished courtesy of the services that it provided that were vital for the survival of our modern society.1.
Choosing to work hard is the key to being successful.”Growing up, Bezos says that his motto was "nil sine labore," which means “nothing without hard work.” He firmly believed that hard work has no replacement.
Many people often ask him the difference between a gift and a skill.
Or does being talented at something require effort on your part?
To this, Bezos replies that when you have a gift and you still choose to work hard, you are going to leverage that gift.The world is full of people who have gifts but either they don’t realize their potential or don’t have the means to take full advantage of them.
But there is one thing that everyone must know you have to put in the work every day to meet your goals.2.
No dream is too big.”We all have dreams.
But some of us are afraid to chase them.
However, having big dreams often act as a driving force to do something great in our lives.
It gives a sense of purpose that we need to achieve every morning when we open our eyes.
Some people dream of having a job, while others dream of giving something back to society.
But no matter what that dream might be, it is up to us to figure out how to chase it and turn it into reality.With his Blue Origin`s New Shepard rocket ship, Jeff says he achieved his lifelong dream.
Though not many of us dream about owning a rocket ship company, it is a pure example that no dream is too big.
As they say, if we shoot for the moon, we might just land among the stars.3.
Think bigger than yourself to understand the needs around youMany people understand, while accomplishing their goals that there is more to life than just what is right in front of them.
Jeff Bezos shares that right after his trip to space, he was inspired to commit $ 10 billion to fight climate change in the next decade.Recently, he has taken a pledge to donate $2 billion to the cause of “restoring nature and transforming food systems.” We might not have billions to spend on a cause, but we can do what we surely can for a cause that we believe in.
Whether it is replacing plastic bags with cloth bags or going green every small effort counts.
It also gives us a new perspective to look beyond ourselves.4.
Don’t let your circumstances define you.”If you have seen this amazing case study on Jeff Bezos, you must have realized that he wasn’t born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
He did not inherit a large, well-functioning business.
Just like many of us, he was surrounded by many challenges.
He was born to a 16-year-old mother and spent his summers working on his grandparents’ ranch during the summer.Smooth roads never make good drivers.
The challenges that come in our lives make us stronger, smarter and more experienced.

[+]conference on September 6, 2012 in Santa Monica, California.
Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)Getty ImagesFew of us will ever have the opportunity to work side-by-side with one visionary billionaire throughout our career.
Ann Hiatt worked for two of them: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt.“The greatest gift in my life has been sitting next to the smartest CEOs in the world and learning step-by-step how they think, act, motivate, and make decisions,” Hiatt writes in her book,Bet On Yourself.I recently caught up with Hiatt to learn more about her experiences at Amazon and Google where she worked as the ‘right-hand’ for Bezos, Schmidt, and Marissa Mayer before Mayer left Google to become CEO of Yahoo.Hiatt offers six strategies that professionals should cultivate to build the career of their dreams.1.
Prioritize learning.Hiatt sat three feet away from Jeff Bezos during Amazon’s hyper-growth period.
What struck her most about Bezos is that he never stopped learning.
Bezos walked into the office with three newspapers tucked under his arm.
Hiatt would snag them off his desk and read them during her lunch break.
By that time of day, Bezos had moved on to briefing documents, books, and scientific papers.MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Tax Software Of 2022Best Tax Software For The Self-Employed Of 2022Income Tax Calculator: Estimate Your TaxesMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella once said that it’s better to be a “learn-it-all” instead of a “know-it-all.” Hiatt couldn’t agree more based on the CEOs she has worked with at Google and Amazon.
Leaders who reach the top are life-long learners well after they complete their formal education.2.
Surround yourself with brilliance.They say you’re the average of the five people you associate with the most, so choose that group wisely.“I always prioritized the type of people I wanted to work for over anything else, including the job title and salary,” Hiatt told me.
I knew they would shape the kind of person and leader I would become.”Hiatt and I agree that you don’t need to know the person to surround yourself with brilliant people and their ideas.
Instead, follow great thinkers and leaders on social media, watch their speeches or lectures on YouTube and TED Talks, or take classes on platforms such as LinkedIn or Masterclass.“The Internet is the great equalizer in access to great thinking,” says Hiatt.
Brilliance is all around you.
Take advantage of it.3.
Find meaningful impact.According to Hiatt, one way to get noticed in an organization is to identify overlooked opportunities to make an impact.
These opportunities might come disguised in tasks that are not part of your job description.
For example, in the tech companies she worked at, Hiatt volunteered to run ‘war rooms,’ meetings where top executives met to quickly fix problems or make big decisions.“I got access to the most powerful people in the company who also learned my name and recognized my value,” says Hiatt.Make yourself useful and absorb leadership lessons along the way.4.
Follow the leader you want to become.Hiatt says if she had to pick just one strategy, this is it.
There are so many people who stagnate in their careers because they don’t seek out the leaders they want to become,” she says.After years of working for Google vice president Marissa Mayer, Hiatt chose to apply for the Chief of Staff position to Google CEO Eric Schmidt.
After observing his management style, Hiatt decided that she could learn a lot by working with Schmidt side-by-side.
The two remain close to this day (Schmidt wrote the forward to Hiatt’s book).Identify the people in an organization who reflect the traits you’d like to develop.
Once you do, find a way to work for them or collaborate with them on projects.5.
Connect the opportunity dots.Steve Jobs told a Stanford graduating class that the milestones in your career would often connect, but it’s hard to see the connections until you look to the past.Hiatt says if those dots do, indeed, connect, then it’s worthwhile to set a North Star for yourself to avoid being blown off course.
In other words, be the CEO of your own life: set goals, create a mission statement, and decide on your life’s driving purpose.According to Hiatt, “Life’s greatest joys follow once you have a dream so strong that it pulls you forward, rather than the other way around.”6.
Make the ordinary extraordinary.Hiatt noticed a common habit among the top CEOs she worked for—they demanded excellence from every task, every meeting, and every presentation.Good isn’t good enough.
About any project you’re working on, always yourself the following question:Is it excellent?Hiatt says that Bezos, Schmidt, and Mayer taught her that individuals can design their own careers and create their futures.
Pay attention to the leaders you’d like to emulate and they’ll show you the path to a career of joy, adventure, and success.Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsiteor some of my other workhere.Carmine GalloEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions

You may know him as the founder of Amazon, the largest retailer in the world.
His name?
This extraordinary man goes by the name of none other than, Jeffrey Preston Bezos.
We have come to know him as someone who has changed the way we shop forever, he continues to show us new ways to push the envelope and change the modern world.
Who would have known the son of a teen mother would have become the man he is today.
He was introduced to the world on January 12, 1964 in Albuquerque New Mexico.
He was conceived by Jacklyn Bezos and her husband Ted Jorgensen.Years later, his mother married Miguel Bezos, a Cuban immigrant.
This is where Jeff got the well known last name of Bezos.
He attended Princeton University where he got his degree in electrical engineering and computer science.
After graduating in 1986, Bezos went to Wall Street where he found a successful job.
Not long after, he found himself, beheld with an idea that would change his life forever.
That idea was Amazon.
With the success his company brought him, he has found many ways to use his influence for the betterment of others, becoming a hero to many.
A hero contains many traits.
A few being, determination, resilience, passion, and care.
Jeff Bezos is a modern day hero because of his unconditional care for others and his unbreakable determination.Jeff Bezos in his determined state of mindtheverge.comJeff Bezos has furthered his title as a modern day hero through his immense determination that has made him a fearless entrepreneur and innovator.
His determination was proven to be useful as he struggled to make a decision to quit his Wall Street job to pursue his dream.
Seen in the light, it was a really difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot.
I didn’t think I’d regret trying and failing.
And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all”(Catherine Clifford para.
18) said Bezos.
He was fixed with the decision to quit and pursue his dream or sit there and and watch it fade.
But after seeing that Web usage had been growing by 2,300% a year, Bezos knew he had to do something about it.
Bezos was able pursue his dream of Amazon because of his determination to start something new and his propensity to not fear failure.
Bezos’ determination doesn’t stop there.

The Fabulous Life of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, the Second-Richest Person inthe World.” Businessinsider.com, 15 May 2017, 4:04pm,Clifford, Catherine.
Preston Bezos was born to a ranch family in Albuquerque, New Mexico on January 12, 1964.
Jeff’s mother, who was a teenager when he was born, only remained with his father for about a year, then remarried Miguel Bezos, a Cuban immigrant who had come to the U.S. by himself when he was 15, working his way through the university to become an engineer for Exxon.Jeff Bezos showed a precocious interest in engineering himself, tinkering with things around the house, even turning his parents’ garage into a sort of laboratory.
He pursued his passion for science and technology while in high school, attending the Student Science Training Program at the University of Florida.
He also started his first business in high school: the Dream Institute, a summer enrichment camp for grade-schoolers.After turning briefly to physics in his undergraduate studies, Bezos committed to his love for computers and went on to earn his degree from Princeton in electrical engineering and computer science.After college, he took a job on Wall Street that allowed him to still be involved in the field of computer science.
He quickly established a high-paying career for himself in finance.But once again, his lifelong curiosity would draw him back into the world of technology.
He left his lucrative job and went headlong in pursuit of his inspired start-up vision: he saw the opening for e-commerce in the rapid development of the Internet, along with recent changes in tax regulation, and he came up with an idea to take advantage of these profitable conditions.He didn’t waste any time, either.
Bezos wrote the business plan for the online bookstore we now know as Amazon while making the cross-country trip from New York to Seattle, where he would start his new company in his garage.Amazon and BeyondWith only a few employees, Bezos started developing software in his own home.
After having his friends beta test the site, he launched Amazon.com on July 16, 1995.It was an instant success.
In the first few weeks of its existence, with no promotional budget, Amazon grossed $20,000 in international book sales, a faster growth than Bezos himself had imagined.When Amazon went public in 1997, Bezos faced doubts about whether the company could compete with established retailers once they too went online.
But Amazon had changed the game and continued to lead.What set Amazon apart from other companies during the dot.com bust was its versatility: Bezos repeated his model for book sales with CDs and videos, then with apparel, electronics, and other items, turning Amazon into a one-stop shop by partnering with more and more retailers.In 2011, Amazon saw a 70% growth and was valued at over $17 billion.The net worth of Jeff Bezos is estimated in the billions as well, but he’s not simply accumulating wealth.
Instead of paying himself the typical CEO-sized salary, he invests in the next big innovation.In 2006, he announced that he had founded a human spaceflight startup, Blue Origin, with plans to make space exploration widely available.
He is also venturing into what he calls the “uncharted terrain” of online journalism with his purchase in 2013 of the Washington Post.
Again, Bezos is taking the lead by taking the risks that will adapt the marketplace.Success in New Ideas, Not NumbersIn 2014, Jeff Bezos ranked 17th on the list of wealthiest people in the world.
But this statistic is not the right measure for his success.If Bezos were driven to be successful by making money, Amazon would probably not exist, at least not as we know it today, because he might not have risked his wealthy lifestyle for the chance to start something new, from the ground up—and not just a new business, but a new way of doing business.If personal wealth was what Bezos was after, he could simply let Amazon run its course and collect the profits, instead of investing in new possibilities, reinvigorating the news and space industries through adaptive innovation.Bezos recognizes possibilities within emerging conditions and takes action for the sake of these possibilities.
Although his story is filled with impressive numbers, its theme is putting new ideas into practice.

You earn reputation by trying to do hard things well.
What we need to do is always lean into the future; when the world changes around you and when it changes against you - what used to be a tail wind is now a head wind - you have to lean into that and figure out what to do because complaining isn't a strategy.
What's dangerous is not to evolve.
I think frugality drives innovation, just like other constraints do.
One of the only ways to get out of a tight box is to invent your way out.
The human brain is an incredible pattern-matching machine.
If you only do things where you know the answer in advance, your company goes away.
We've had three big ideas at Amazon that we've stuck with for 18 years, and they're the reason we're successful: Put the customer first.
Invent.
And be patient.
There'll always be serendipity involved in discovery.
If you don't understand the details of your business you are going to fail.
A company shouldn't get addicted to being shiny, because shiny doesn't last.
Real estate is the key cost of physical retailers.
That's why there's the old saw: location, location, location.
Amazon.com strives to be the e-commerce destination where consumers can find and discover anything they want to buy online.
I have won this lottery.
It's a gigantic lottery, and it's called Amazon.com.
And I'm using my lottery winnings to push us a little further into space.
The key thing about a book is that you lose yourself in the author's world.
Life's too short to hang out with people who aren't resourceful.
The best customer service is if the customer doesn't need to call you, doesn't need to talk to you.
It just works.
If you do build a great experience, customers tell each other about that.
Word of mouth is very powerful.
If you're competitor-focused, you have to wait until there is a competitor doing something.
Being customer-focused allows you to be more pioneering.
It's not an experiment if you know it's going to work.
If you can't tolerate critics, don't do anything new or interesting.
The common question that gets asked in business is, 'why?'
That's a good question, but an equally valid question is, 'why not?
There are two ways to extend a business.
Take inventory of what you're good at and extend out from your skills.
Or determine what your customers need and work backward, even if it requires learning new skills.
Kindle is an example of working backward.
Humans are unbelievably data efficient.
You don't have to drive 1 million miles to drive a car, but the way we teach a self-driving car is have it drive a million miles.
If your customer base is aging with you, then eventually you are going to become obsolete or irrelevant.
You need to be constantly figuring out who are your new customers and what are you doing to stay forever young.

Trump, the source said, is eyeing legal means to take down Amazon.
Axios wrote that Trump believes the company is harming smaller companies and wants to curtail its dominance on online shopping.Trump wants to do so by considering a change in Amazon's tax status or utilizing antitrust law against the company.In the week that's followed that Axios report, Trump hasn't been shy about blasting the company on Twitter and in public.On Tuesday alone, Trumptweetedthat he was "right" about his criticism of Amazon's deal with the US Postal Service,later telling reportersin the White House that Amazon is causing massive store closuresBut this is nothing new, as the president has been waging war againstthe internet giant for more than a year.In December, he tweeted that the e-commerce giant was unfairly reaping the benefits of that USPS deal, something that Axios reported Wednesday was still very much on Trump's mind.
Trump said the deal was enriching Amazon while making the USPS "dumber and poorer.
Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer?
Trump tweeted.
Should be charging MUCH MORE!
In August, he accused the company of doing "great damage to tax paying retailers," adding that "towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt — many jobs being lost!
And beginning in December 2016, Trump took hit after hit at The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon's founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, tying the publication to Amazon.He accusedThe Post ofpossibly beinga "lobbyist weapon" for the company, seeking to keep politicians "from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly."
He called the publication a "big tax shelter" for Amazon, the stock of which he said would "crumble like a paper bag" if the company "ever had to pay fair taxes.
And he attempted to brandthe paper as the "#AmazonWashingtonPost.
Though Trump and Bezos have been part of a few meetings together, the Amazon CEO has raised eyebrows by appearing to wear his emotions on his sleeve.
His expressions don'tsuggest any sortof chemistry between the two leaders.—Ryan McGee  (@TVMcGee)June 20, 2017Amazon does have a lot working in its favoras it faces headwinds from Trump.
An August poll from theleft-leaning Public Policy Pollingfound that 53% of Trump voters held a favorable view of Amazon, while just 20% held an unfavorable view of the company.
Another 27% said they were not sure.Among all respondents, 60% held favorable views of Amazon, while 13% viewed the company unfavorably and 26% were unsure.And a recent Reuters poll found that 60% of online shoppers planned to use Amazon for most of their holiday purchases, a 10-point increase in just two years.Their main competitors, Walmart, Target, and Macy's, all saw a decline in the percentage of shoppers who used their online services.Asked by Business Insider last year about the administration's thoughts on Amazon and some of the other tech giants possibly becoming too large, a White House official said in a statement that the internet tech industry was "one of the crown jewels in the American economy."
But "nonetheless," they said, "the stability of the rule of law equally to all is also a critical component to economic prosperity.
Violations of the law will be enforced," the official said.This post has been updated.Sign up for notifications from Insider!

6, 2019, 11:46 AM UTCByAllan SmithIn just about every direction, the White House is surrounded by e-commerce giant Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos.Almost due west from the executive mansion is Amazon Books, a brick-and-mortar version of its e-commerce destination.
The$23 million mansionowned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is a 15-minute drive to the northwest.
The Washington Post, owned by Bezos, is a short walk to the northeast.
Amazon’s Washington headquarters is just to the east.Head a bit farther south across the Potomac River into Virginia and there’s Crystal City, soon to be renamed “National Landing” once Amazon makes it home to its massive second headquarters, or HQ2, investment.Even beyond that, the outskirts of the city — a northern Virginia area thathas been described as“the bull’s-eye of America’s internet” — is home to 29 of the company’s 35 Amazon Web Services data centers.
On a map, it can look like a pending invasion of the nation’s capital.But Amazon is already deeply embedded in Washington and has plans to further entrench itself in the nation’s capital, putting it close to power brokers as well as billions of dollars in government contracts.
While major tech companies have ingrained themselves in the capital in recent years, none are as present as Amazon, according to policy and lobbying experts who spoke to NBC News.Many companies have cozied up to Washington, but none have accrued the kind of presence and reach that Amazon will soon boast.
And with good reason.
Amazon’s government interests expand well beyond lobbying.
It is now facing growing calls to be broken up by the federal government while also bidding for billions of dollars worth of government contracts.
I think they see there is a lot of profit to be made in government contracts and want to be part of that," said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor.
Maybe some of the Amazon executives in the area will end up going to the same country club as antitrust or tax policymakers and end up offering jobs or internships to bureaucrats or political appointees' kids, or engage in similar soft corruption.
There are a lot of opportunities for influence once you get your own people insinuated into the elite clubs, schools, and other social venues in D.C."Prime real estateAmazon's Washington operation is headlined by the upcoming arrival of HQ2, which the company opted to place in the area after what amounted to a nationwide competition.Amazon initially announced a separate second headquarters in New York City, but withdrew amid political pressure over subsidies the state had offered to lure the company.
As a result of HQ2,Amazon has pledgedto deliver 25,000 new jobs in the Virginia area over the next decade.David Fontana, a George Washington University law professor, said the company was making fairly standard moves early on — building up a lobbying presence and hiring Washington insiders "to do D.C.
work.
But with HQ2, the company is bringing the business side of their operation in as well.
As he put it, "there's nothing like" the influx of private sector jobs Amazon is planning in the nation’s capital in the city's history.
That's a big line to cross," Fontana said.An Amazon spokesperson said the company decided to locate "in Virginia" because of the state’s "business-friendly environment" and its belief that it will be able to attract "world-class talent" to the area.
Its proximity to D.C. did not influence our HQ2 decision," the spokesperson said.
A little scary'When it comes to lobbying, Amazon lobbied more government entities than any tech company last year,Bloomberg reported.
So far in 2019, it's spent more on lobbying than any tech company, at more than $8.1 million, after spending a record $14.4 million in 2018, according toThe Center for Responsive Politics.AsBloombergnoted, Amazon has increased its lobbying spending by more than 460 percent since 2012 while the company's roster of in-house lobbyists has nearly tripled since 2015.
The companyhas lobbied the governmenton an array of issues, like taxes, trade, immigration and defense.While Amazon's lobbying efforts are expansive and growing, they are comparable to companies like Facebook, Northrop Grumman and AT&T.
And though Amazon's expansion into the Washington market will outpace other private sector employers, defense contractors and other large businesses have populated the land between the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers for some time, viewing the nation’s capital as essential to their core business.
Amazon provides a wide range of products and services for our customers, and we’re always looking for ways to innovate on their behalf," an Amazon spokesperson told NBC News.
Our Washington, D.C., team is focused on ensuring we are advocating on issues that are important to our customers, our employees and policymakers.
But Amazon isn’t quite comparable to other companies, according to Terry Schilling, executive director of the American Principles Project, a conservative think tank.
I don't think I've ever seen a corporation, like a single corporation, have this type of impact and influence on public policy from a federal all the way down to a state and local level," Schilling said.
And it's very impressive and a little scary.
For Amazon, what's at stakeWhat does Amazon care about?
For starters, getting government agencies to use its cloud computing services and buy supplies from its site, observers say.The company dove headfirst into the government contracting competition, most prominently seeking a cloud computingcontract with the Pentagonworth up to $10 billion, after having locked down a similar, slightly less-lucrative contract with the CIA earlier in the decade.But that contract has also shown that some politicians are growing wary of Amazon's power.
Last month, Defense Secretary Mark Esper launched a review of the bidding process after Amazon's competitors like IBM and Oracle complained that the terms for the contract were unfairly designed to benefit Amazon, a claim that a federal judge and the Government Accountability Office ruled against.
That also came after the White Housedemandedsuch a review — something that leading Republicans on Capitol Hill like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., have pushed for as well.Rubio wrote Esper multiple times on the subject and, as one senior Senate aide told NBC News, has been aggressively lobbying fellow senators to further scrutinize the contract.
A Rubio spokesperson told NBC News that the senator spoke to Trump and national security adviser John Bolton about the contract, and his staff has worked with the Defense Department on the issue prior to its announcement of a review.
Of note, billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison donated millions to Rubio's presidential campaign.Amazon employees protest on Prime DayJuly 15, 201903:00An Amazon spokesperson called the claims of unfairness "meritless and a desperate attempt to distort the facts," pointing to the federal court ruling.That battle might pale in comparison to other headwinds the company may face depending on the results of the next presidential election.
While Trump has repeatedly taken aim at the company because of Bezos' ownership of The Post, other 2020 contenders like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,who has also been critical of The Post/Bezos nexus, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have discussed breaking up the company.
Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justiceare currently investigatingAmazon for possible antitrust violations.And, should a Democrat win the White House in 2020, there's likely to be increased scrutiny over the rules that allow Amazon to avoidpaying federal income taxes.
Look, when you are the biggest retailer on the planet, there's going to be some overlap on the government stuff, and it also puts this huge bull's-eye on you," said one Washington insider who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he counts Blue Origin, Bezos' space exploration company, among his clients.
Walmart's probably sitting back saying, 'Oh thank, God," because, it used to be everybody trashed Walmart.
While Amazon is often grouped in with fellow tech giants like Facebook and Google in terms of the scrutiny it receives, Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, a liberal think tank that has long urged much tougher regulation of the big tech companies, said Amazon is in a unique position to influence Washington.
Now you have the richest man in the country running one of the biggest companies in the country, owning The Washington Post and bringing massive numbers of employees to D.C.," Stoller said.
That's really breaking down a wall that has existed since the founding of the country, which is that we keep our business centers and our political centers separate.

This Is What Really Happens When Amazon Comes to Your Town - POLITICO MagazineSkip to Main ContentPOLITICO MagazineMenuOur LatestEmail Signuppolitico.comFacebookTwitterElaine Thompson/AP PhotoLETTER FROM SEATTLEThis Is What Really Happens When Amazon Comes to Your TownTrust me, I saw my city transform—and not always for the better.By PAUL ROBERTSOctober 19, 2017Continue to article contentFacebookTwitterCommentPrintContinue to article contentSeattle journalist Paul Roberts writes about technology, business and politics.
His latest book isThe Impulse Society: America in the Age of Instant Gratification.
Follow him@pauledrobertsSEATTLE—Thursday is the deadline for cities bidding to host “HQ2,” as Amazon calls its planned second headquarters, and the competition has been intense.
More than a hundred would-be hosts have assembled generous packages with everything from multibillion-dollar tax breaks to free utilities to anofferto build Amazon its own city (also named Amazon) in the hope of enticing the online retail giant and up to 50,000 of its handsomely paid employees.But as these cities go all-out to win Amazon’s affections, they might take a lesson from the city where those same affections have dimmed: Seattle.
To be sure, the town’s business community is mortified to be losing so much of Amazon’s future growth to another city and has roundly blamed the city’s left-leaning “anti-business” politics.
But many ordinary Seattleites seem relieved.
Most would acknowledge the extraordinary prosperity that Amazon has brought to Seattle since Jeff Bezos and his startup arrived in 1994.
But they are also keenly aware of the costs, not least the nation’s fastest-rising housing prices, appalling traffic and a painful erosion of urban identity.
What was once a quirkily mellow, solidly middle-class city now feels like a stressed-out, two-tier town with a thin layer of wealthy young techies atop a base of anxious wage workers.
As one City Council member put it, HQ2 may give Seattle “a little breathing room” to cope with a decade of raging, Amazon-fueled growth.
A commenter on a local news site was less diplomatic: “Amazon = cancer.”None of which will deter Amazon’s suitors.
In their view, any downsides from HQ2 will pale against the upsides—the six-figure salaries and the $5 billion campus, of course, but more than that, the legendary Amazon power to transform a city, as it has Seattle, into a “knowledge capital.”Yet as anyone who has witnessed that Seattle transformation firsthand could tell you, Amazon’s suitors may be laboring under some fairly unrealistic expectations.
Certainly, they are underestimating the impact that tens of thousands of young, well-paid “knowledge” workers can have on local infrastructure, housing prices and even politics.
But they’re probably also overstating the benefits of being Amazon’s second company town.
That’s because they don’t fully appreciate how much of Seattle’s Amazon miracle was due, not to Bezos or Amazon or even the knowledge economy, but to Seattle’s own very particular mix of economic, cultural and environmental ingredients.
These homegrown upsides might not be so easy to replicate.
When outsiders gaze covetouslyat Seattle’s Amazon boom, what they’re really seeing isn’t the effect of a single company, but of a chain reaction.
Amazon is now so central to the global knowledge economy that it exerts its own economic gravitational force on the tech industry.
The company’s dominance in cloud computing, for example, means that other cloud players feel pressure to be in Seattle.
This clustering of firms around Amazon has created a talent vortex, which has drawn more tech workers to Seattle.
And that enlarged talent pool has in turn attracted still more tech firms, which have drawn still more workers to the city, and so on.This self-feeding dynamic, known as “agglomeration,” has been a huge force in Seattle.
In the past seven years alone—the period of Amazon’s most explosive growth—more than 20 Fortune 500 companies have opened engineering or R&D campuses here—including Facebook, Google and Apple, tech’s three other giants, plus newcomers like Uber.
The city has gained 53,000 jobs (on top of the roughly 40,000 at the Amazon headquarters), some $17 billion in new wages, salaries, and other compensation, and $38 billion in new investment, according to Amazon’s own analysis.
Indeed, even since the HQ2 announcement, Amazon has locked up an additional 1.2 million square feet of office space in downtown Seattle.)
Little wonder that other cities believe HQ2 will be “a transformational event,” as one consultant put it.
Or that the Seattle Chamber of Commerce would reprimand its own citizens for not recognizing that “Amazon is the best thing that has happened to the city in the modern era.”But cities hoping for their own transformational event should keep several caveats in mind.
Most obviously, Amazon isn’t the only reason Seattle has been attracting all the firms, talent and capital.
The area’s “other” tech icon, Microsoft, headquartered since 1986 in nearby Redmond, is still spinning out its own considerable agglomerative powers.
It boasts the world’s second-largest cloud operation, a huge workforce and a famously productive web of spinoffs and startups, many of which now exert their own Seattle gravitational pull.
The Seattle-based travel company Expedia, to take one example, is a Microsoft spinoff, whose creator (and eventual CEO), Richard Barton, went on to launch Seattle-based real estate website Zillow.
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, a prodigious startup launcher in his own right, also developed the vast business park downtown that became Amazon’s campus.
Other gravitational centers abound.
AT&T Cellular and Nintendo are here.
The very tech-focused University of Washington has launched scores of ventures and technology transfers.
And for all the talk of the “new” economy, one of Seattle’s biggest tech firms is also one of its oldest—aerospace giant Boeing, which has been attracting engineers and computer scientists, and launching spinoffs, for decades.In other words, long before Amazon was even a business plan, Seattle had developed what urban geographer Heike Mayer calls the “entrepreneurial ecology”—a potent mix of talent, institutional expertise and networks that startups like Microsoft and later Amazon were able to plug into.
And that ecology still provides a critical advantage to newcomers—one that could hardly be expected to transfer neatly to another city simply because Amazon builds a headquarters there.Prospective host cities will point to their own nascent tech sectors, prestigious universities and other local sources of tech talent: Amazon would hardly be starting from scratch.
But a closer look at Seattle makes clear that this city’s powerful entrepreneurial ecology wasn’t driven only by its tech sector.
Seattle’s deservedly outsized reputation for inventiveness runs the full business spectrum.
The city is a long-time leader in medical, bioscience and genetics research.
It is the epicenter for some of the biggest retail innovations of the modern era, including Starbucks, Nordstrom, REI and Eddie Bauer.
Costco is based just outside the city.)
Even the city’s art and indie music scene is enormously enterprising: SubPop Records almost single-handedly launched grunge music.
By the time Bezos arrived, Seattle boasted a proven culture of innovating, executing and branding that would have been fertile ground for a company trying to reinvent retailing—and that is still giving a unique boost to the city’s tech sector.Other cities will have skilled workforces and universities, says Andy Yan, director of The City Program at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, and a longtime observer of Seattle’s economy.
But what they can’t duplicate is Seattle’s weird mix of history, culture and business, “The same culture that came up with Amazon also came up with grunge,” Yan says.
I mean, how much of Amazon is actually the ‘child’ of Nordstrom and Nirvana?” And how much of that “alchemy,” as Yan calls it, will transfer to another town?Yan’s alchemy underscores another important, and hard to duplicate, factor in Seattle’s Amazon moment: This city is a bizarrely powerful people magnet.
Jeff Bezos sends a birthday message to his fourth-grade teacherMake ItAmazonfounder and billionaireJeff Bezosis the richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg, with anet worth of more than $122 billion.
In addition to running the e-commerce behemoth Amazon, he is also the founder of aerospace company, Blue Origin.He has been, by any measure, massively successful.But Bezos hasn't forgotten the people who helped him get there.
In 2018, in a sweet video message, he took a moment to pay homage to his fourth grade teacher, Celestine Barnes, who inspired and supported him along his journey.Barnes taught Bezos at theRiver Oaks Elementary Schoolin Houston, Texas.Jeff Bezos, AmazonLindsey Wasson | ReutersBarnes' daughter, Jenise Raven, worked for weeks to get Bezos' attention ahead of her mother's 80th birthday in February 2018, according to areport from local Houston newsstation KHOU 11.
Raven was hoping Bezos might send a card.Instead, Bezos said happy birthday via the video embedded above.
Raven played the video at her mother's party on Saturday.
KHOU 11 published a piece about the video Monday and Amazon provided the video toCNBC Make It.In the video, Bezos says:"Hi Mrs. Barnes, it's Jeff Bezos.
You were one of my favorite teachers back in elementary school.
I remember you from 4th grade very well.
You may not recognize me, I had more hair back then, but I sure remember you.
You had a big impact on me.
I heard you were turning 80.
That's a big milestone!
Congratulations and happy birthday.
I learned a lot at River Oaks.
You were definitely one of my favorite teachers.
Thank you for making 4th grade so special for me and for all the other kids too.
I know you've been more than 30 years as a teacher and principal.
You've had a big impact on people's lives.
Great teachers do change lives.
We were all incredibly lucky to have you.
Happy birthday, Mrs.
Barnes!
I need [my mom] to know that she's special, not only to me, but to all the people she touched throughout her journey," says Raven,speaking to KHOU 11 News.
I'm so appreciative and so grateful and so humbled by this whole experience.
Barnes was surprised and happy.
I was thrilled.
I see a lot of my students in different roles, former students.
Jeff is one who has been really outstanding, and I'm pleased to see him," says Barnes to KHOU 11.
This has been fabulous.
I didn't know all this was going on.
I'm amazed to no end.
I'm truly thankful and grateful.
Bezos remembered summers in Texas in hiscommencement speech at Princeton in 2010.
He recounted learning a lesson from his grandfather, that it is harder to be "kind" than it is to be "clever.
Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice.
Gifts are easy — they're given after all.
Choices can be hard.
You can seduce yourself with your gifts if you're not careful, and if you do, it'll probably be to the detriment of your choices," says Bezos in his graduation speech.
When you are 80 years old, and in a quiet moment of reflection narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your life story, the telling that will be most compact and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made.
In the end, we are our choices," says Bezos.This story was originally published on Feb. 7, 2018.

His favorite show is Avatar: The Last Airbender.
As of right now, he’s a charity fundraiser in Cincinnati.Feb 28, 2023Table of ContentsWith a Little Help from His ParentsJeff Bezos is ComplicatedWhat Makes Jeff More Than a SymbolAuthor‘Bezos: the Beginning’is a made-for-television movie now available for streaming onAmazon Primeand Google Play.
It details the rise, trials, and tribulations ofBezos’early life in his attempt to start his now titanic e-commerce company.
We witness Bezos (played byArmando Gutierez) start out as an endearing yet unconfident VP of a hedge fund company, then transition to creating an entirely online startup for purchasing books, then the polishing and repolishing of the idea ofAmazonuntil it bears some semblance of how we know it today.I was surprised that a biopic about his life hadn’t been made yet.
To any given American citizen, Bezos is a wealth of mysteries and secrets.
He represents our current economic system at its most extreme, and is as famous as any other famous tech giant (Bill Gates,Mark Zuckerberg,Jack Dorsey).
Surely someone would have tried to make a film about him in the same vein as‘The Social Network’.
Somehow, not until now.
Overall, it’s a fairly watered-down interpretation of the controversial tech giant’s early life, sticking to the basic facts and not too much more.
The book the movie is based on,‘Jeff Bezos-Zero to Hero’,  provides a fairly neutral if not more positive image of Bezos.
We occasionally see him get into fights with his two other employees, and an increasingly fraught relationship with his (now ex) wifeMacKenzie Scott(played byAlex Mitchell).
Still, there are things that an average person might not know about Jeff Bezos that were explored well in this story.
Like the book, the movie tries to make room for moments that give a more complete and whole picture into who Jeff Bezos was and is as a person.Things to do:Subscribe toThe Hollywood Insider’sYouTube Channel, by clicking here.Limited Time Offer – FREE Subscription toThe Hollywood InsiderClick here to read more onThe Hollywood Insider’svision, values and mission statement here – Media has the responsibility to better our world –The Hollywood Insiderfully focuses on substance and meaningful entertainment, against gossip and scandal, by combining entertainment, education, and philanthropy.With a Little Help from His ParentsOne part of Bezos’ life that adds a lot to who he is that the movie touches on early in the story is the role his parents played in his life and career trajectory.
After Jeff and MacKenzie decide to quit their jobs and begin their start-up, the first thing they do is ask around for loans.
They drive toBezos’ parentshouse, and he asks them for an enormous loan, to which they ultimately agree to the next day.
To say this is generous is an understatement.
It’s an incredible opportunity that his parents give him at this moment, and it’s not baseless either.
The movie notes that Bezos’ parents care deeply about their son, and would do almost anything to help their son succeed.This definitely adds an important layer to Bezos and his life story.
For obvious reasons, the interaction plays a huge part in defining the entrepreneur: namely, his resourcefulness and his luck.
He showed determination in taking the first step by trying to find money, which can be difficult for many reasons.
The scene also becomes a commentary on the nature of what a person may or may not need when starting a business in our country.
Three hundred thousand dollars is an enormous amount, but in terms of getting a business as ambitious as Jeff’s off the ground, it’s probably closer to what it would really take.Related video:EVOLUTION: Every Tom Cruise Role From 1981 to 2021, All Performances Exceptionally PoignantRelated video:EVOLUTION: Every Johnny Depp Role From 1984 to 2020, All Performances Exceptionally PoignantJeff Bezos is ComplicatedOne area this movie succeeded in when it did touch on it was the moodier side of Bezos.
At times, the man comes across as mild-mannered, unwilling to step over other people to achieve his dreams.
However, there are a few instances where a completely different aspect of him comes out.
His relationship with MacKenzie starts out very supportive and without ego, but soon sours as complications pile up.
While he’s kind to his employees’ faces most of the time, it’s also revealed that he’d purposely left out details of the plan he priorly discussed withShel Kaphanthat would’ve helped his career and finances.To be honest, the movie could have expanded a little more on this part of his life.
Some of the most important moments would arguably be Bezos’ early decisions that negatively affected the people around him and their greater implications.
His competitors, his employees, and his wife are occasionally mistreated.
The darker side of Bezos is mainly relegated to the end of the movie, when he tells one of his smartest and hardest-working employees that he should’ve cared about his future more instead of giving the employee the kind of share he had asked for.Related article:MUST WATCH –The Hollywood Insider’sCEO Pritan Ambroase’s Love Letter to Black Lives Matter – VIDEORelated article:Why Queen Elizabeth II Is One Of The Greatest Monarchs | Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of United Queendom of Great Britain & Northern Ireland (Video Insight)Related article:All Best Actor/Actress Speeches From The Beginning Of Oscars 1929-2019 | Hollywood InsiderWhat Makes Jeff More Than a SymbolLast but not least, this movie also attempted to flesh out Bezos’ specific relationships with the people around him.
For instance, one of the most important relationships he has is with his wife, MacKenzie Scott.
MacKenzie worked at the same company he did at the beginning, and both are very ambitious people being spiritually crushed by their mindless hedge fund jobs.
Bezos had a drive to do something more innovative, and MacKenzie was extremely creative with larger writing aspirations.
Another defining relationship Bezos had is with his future competitor and founder of Barnes and Noble,Len Riggio.
Riggio is incredibly skeptical and mocking Bezos’ idea, and this skepticism climaxes to anger when he threatens to sue Bezos over calling his e-commerce store the largest bookstore.The way the movie portrays how Bezos handles these interactions and their increasing hostility and disappointment is one of the most interesting parts of the story, and are defining moments that will shape the rest of his emotional life.
At first, Bezos and his wife give each other grace when they make mistakes.
This is true for his employees as well.
Then, things take downturns when various obstacles come up: when funding is hard to come by, when no one else seems to like the idea, and so on.
Once this stuff starts happening, Bezos struggles to balance the stress with handling his relationships with care.
One helpful way to learn more about a person is how they treat others around them.
How he handles this facet of life in all its complexity gives off a fairly nuanced understanding of Bezos’ strengths and weaknesses as an adult.‘Bezos: the Beginning’ has its moments that make it worth watching.
It delivers on expanding on Bezos’ early personal life, and how it intermingled (for better and for worse) with his professional life.
In doing so, the movie successfully paints Bezos as more than just a character worth studying.
He becomes a real person, with real problems and strengths and neuroses like anyone else.

An excerpt from the love letter:The Hollywood Insider’sCEO/editor-in-chiefPritan Ambroaseaffirms,“We have the space and time for all your stories, no matter who/what/where you are.
Media/Cinema/TV have a responsibility to better the world andThe Hollywood Insiderwill continue to do so.Talent, diversity and authenticity matter in Cinema/TV, media and storytelling.
In fact, I reckon that we should announce “talent-diversity-authenticity-storytelling-Cinema-Oscars-Academy-Awards” as synonyms of each other.
We show respect to talent and stories regardless of their skin color, race, gender, sexuality, religion, nationality, etc., thus allowing authenticity into this system just by something as simple as accepting and showing respect to the human species’ factual diversity.
We become greater just by respecting and appreciating talent in all its shapes, sizes, and forms.
Award winners, which includes nominees, must be chosen on the greatness of their talent ALONE.I am sure I am speaking for a multitude of Cinema lovers all over the world when I speak of the following sentiments that this medium of art has blessed me with.
Cinema taught me about our world, at times in English and at times through the beautiful one-inch bar of subtitles.
I learned from the stories in the global movies that we are all alike across all borders.
Remember that one of the best symbols of many great civilizations and their prosperity has been the art they have left behind.
This art can be in the form of paintings, sculptures, architecture, writings, inventions, etc.
For our modern society, Cinema happens to be one of them.
Cinema is more than just a form of entertainment, it is an integral part of society.
I love the world uniting, be it for Cinema, TV, media, art, fashion, sport, etc.
Please keep this going full speed.”More Interesting Stories FromTheHollywood Insider–Want GUARANTEED SUCCESS?

                                  as well as other partner offers and accept ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy.It's been a turbulent two-and-a-half years for Jeff Bezos and his girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez.In January 2019, the bombshell news broke that the Amazon CEO and his wife, MacKenzie, weregetting a divorceafter 25 years of marriage.
Hours later, we learned that Bezos was in a relationship with Lauren Sanchez, a TV host and helicopter pilot who, along with her husband, had been friends with the Bezoses.Despite a tumultuous few months that involved leaked texts, blackmail, a billion-dollar divorce, and maybe even interference from the Saudi Arabian government, Bezos and Sanchez are still going strong.When Bezos embarked onhis high-profile trip to the edge of space, Sanchez was in attendance, greeting him with a hug when he landed back on Earth.Here's how their relationship became public and how they've spent the last two years as a couple.It all started on January 9, 2019.
Shortly after 9 a.m., Jeff and his wife, MacKenzie, issued a joint statement on Twitter that they were divorcing.Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos.Dia Dipasupil / Staff"As our family and close friends know, after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends,"the statement read.
If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again.
MacKenzie is one of Amazon's earliest employees.
The couple has four children together.Hours later, a second bombshell dropped: Bezos was in a relationship with Lauren Sanchez.Lauren Sanchez.Paul Archuleta/Getty ImagesSanchezstarted her career as a news reporter and anchor— she was a longtime anchor of "Good Day LA" on Fox 11 and worked as a correspondent on "Extra.
More recently, she's worked as a helicopter pilot and founded her own aerial filming company in 2016 called Black Ops Aviation.Sanchez has also had TV and film roles, including as the host of the reality show "So You Think You Can Dance" and playing an anchor in movies like "Fight Club" and "The Day After Tomorrow," according toher IMDB page.Bezos and Sanchez met through her then-husband, Patrick Whitesell, the co-CEO of WME, a Hollywood talent agency.Jeff Bezos, right, with Lauren Sanchez and her then-husband, Patrick Whitesell.Todd Williamson/Getty Images for Amazon StudiosSanchez and Whitesell had been married since 2005, but at the time the news broke, the couple had been separated since that fall,according to Page Six.According to Brad Stone's book"Amazon Unbound,"Sanchez and Bezos reconnected at an Amazon Studios party for the film "Manchester by the Sea" in 2016, though it's unclear when their romance began.In March 2018, Sanchez was invited to Amazon's annual MARS conference in Palm Springs.
One month later, they had dinner with Sanchez's brother, Michael, in Los Angeles.That July, Bezos hired Sanchez's company tofilm footagefor his rocket company, Blue Origin.The National Enquirer said it had conducted a four-month investigation into Bezos and Sanchez's relationship and had obtained texts and photos the couple had sent to each other.Jeff Bezos.AP Photo/Pablo Martinez MonsivaisThe Enquirer saidit had tracked the couple "across five states and 40,000 miles, tailed them in private jets, swanky limos, helicopter rides, romantic hikes, five-star hotel hideaways, intimate dinner dates and 'quality time' in hidden love nests.
Page Six, which published the news a few hours before the Enquirer, reported that Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos knew that the Enquirer report was coming out and had timed their divorce announcement to get ahead of the news.The gossip site also reported at the time that Bezos and Sanchez started dating after Jeff and MacKenzie had separated the previous fall, and that MacKenzie knew of the relationship.The Enquirer said it had gotten its hands on "raunchy messages" and "erotic selfies," including a text that reportedly read: "I love you, alive girl.
FILE PHOTO:  Founder, Chairman, CEO and President of Amazon Jeff Bezos speaks during an event about Blue Origin's space exploration plans in WashingtonREUTERS/Clodagh KilcoyneThe tabloid saidit also had racy photosof Bezos, including one that was too explicit to print.But according to Stone's book, the tabloid never actually had a "below-the-belt selfie" of Bezos — it was a photo of someone else Michael Sanchez took from a male escort website and showed to the tabloid over FaceTime.Almost immediately, questions arose about the Enquirer's motives for investigating Bezos and Sanchez and the tabloid's connection to President Trump.David Pecker, CEO of AMI.Marion Curtis via AP, FileA feud has simmered for years between Trump and Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, a frequent Trump target.
The Enquirer's publisher, AMI, is run by David Pecker, a longtime Trump ally.By the end of January,The Daily Beast reportedthat Bezos was funding an investigation into who had leaked his private messages to the Enquirer.
Bezos' personal head of security, Gavin de Becker,headed up the investigation.
De Becker said at the time that he thought the leaks were "politically motivated," whichAMI denied.The investigation initially pointed to Michael Sanchez, Lauren's brother and an outspoken Trump supporter, as the person who leaked the photos and texts, whichSanchez denied.Then, in February, Bezos dropped a bombshell of his own: an explosive blog post titled "No thank you, Mr. Pecker," in which he accused Pecker and AMI of trying to blackmail him.Jeff Bezos.Reuters/Joshua RobertsBezos wrotethat the publisher had been threatening him with the publication of explicit photos he'd taken of himself unless he stopped investigating who was leaking his photos and texts to the tabloid.AMI also demanded that Bezos no longer claim the publisher's investigation into his personal life was influenced by political motivations, Bezos wrote.As a result, Bezos published the emails he'd received from AMI.
Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten," Bezos wrote.Bezos also hinted in the post that there may have been a link between the investigation into his relationship with Sanchez and the Saudi Arabian government — specifically, that he might have been a target of the Saudis because he owns the Washington Post, which provided "unrelenting coverage," Bezos said, of the murder of its journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, who waskilled by Saudi agents.
The "Saudi angle" of Bezos' own investigation into the leaks seemed to have "hit a particularly sensitive nerve" with Pecker, Bezos wrote.For its part,the Saudi Arabian government denied any rolein the situation and called the whole saga a "soap opera.
Things quieted down for Bezos and Sanchez publicly for a few months, until April 2019, when Jeff and MacKenzie finalized the terms of their divorce.Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos at the 2017 Vanity Fair Oscar Party.Evan Agostini / AP ImagesJeff and MacKenzie Bezos bothreleased statements on Twittersaying they had "finished the process of dissolving" their marriage and would be co-parenting their four kids.MacKenzie said she was granting Jeff all her interests in the Washington Post and Blue Origin, as well as 75% of the Amazon stock they owned and voting control over the shares she retained.Her remaining stake in Amazon has positioned her among the richest people in the world witha net worth of $62.7 billion.One day later, Sanchez and Whitesell filed for divorce.Patrick Whitesell and Lauren Sanchez.AP PhotoTMZ reported at the timethat the couple asked for joint custody of their two children.

A few days later, Bezos and Sanchez made their first public appearance as a couple at Wimbledon.Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos.AP Photo/Tim IrelandThe couple wereseated behind the royalsat the men's Wimbledon final between Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic at the All England Club.A few months prior to Wimbledon, the couple had attended another exclusive event: the annual Allen & Company conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.
There, they mingled with Warren Buffett, Tim Cook, and Mark Zuckerberg, according to Stone's book.The pair was spotted again in August on what appeared to be a fabulous European vacation: They were seen strolling through Saint-Tropez and cruising off the coast of Spain, in the Balearic Islands, aboard media mogul David Geffen's superyacht, the Rising Sun.The Rising Sun.Victor Fraile/ReutersOther guestsreportedly includedGoldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and the founder of Thrive Capital, Josh Kushner, along with his supermodel wife, Karlie Kloss.Bezos and Sanchez were then seen on fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg's sailing yacht off the coast of Italy.

Sanchez claimed in the suit that Bezos told journalists he had handed over the images to the tabloid, but he says he never had the photos in his possession.Bezos saidin a court filing of his ownthat the suit amounted to "extortion" and directly threatened free speech.
Bezos sought to dismiss Sanchez's lawsuit under a California law that's intended to protect against frivolous lawsuits.A judge has sincetossed Sanchez's defamation suit, citing a lack of evidence.
The judge later ordered Sanchez to pay $218,000 in legal fees for Bezos.In the lawsuit, Sanchez used the word "fiancé" to describe Bezos' relationship to Lauren Sanchez, implying that the couple is engaged.Bezos and Sanchez outside the Taj Mahal in January.Pawan Sharma/AFP via Getty ImagesHere's the full sentencefrom the lawsuit(emphasis ours):"While Mr. de Becker's initial asserted theory was that Mr. Sanchez had sold out his sister for $200,000, Mr. de Becker soon realized this theory would not hold up because, among other reasons, it was inconceivable that Mr. Sanchez would ruin his relationship with his sister andher current fiancé, the richest man in the world,for financial gain.
Bezos isn't described as Sanchez's fiancé anywhere else in the suit, and Bezos and Sanchez have never confirmed that they're engaged.
In December,Page Six published photosof the couple on vacation, noting that Sanchez was wearing a large diamond ring on her right hand (engagement rings are worn on the left hand).At the time lawyers for Michael Sanchez said in a statement, "Michael's complaint speaks for itself."
Representatives for Bezos and Sanchez did not respond to requests for comment.News broke in February 2020 that Bezos had reportedly purchased the Warner estate, a massive Beverly Hills compound, for $165 million.
The purchase was the most expensive home sale in California history.The Warner estate in Beverly Hills.Los Angeles County/PictometryPrior to the sale,The New York Postreported that Bezos and Sanchez had been house-hunting in Los Angeles and touring mansions throughout the area for weeks.The Warner estatewas built by Hollywood mogul and Warner Bros. cofounder Jack Warner in 1937.
It spans eight acres and is situated in the Benedict Canyon neighborhood of Beverly Hills.
It's an incredibly private property that's surrounded by tall hedges, blocked off by a large gate, and completely hidden from view from the street.The compound is home to multiple dwellings, including two guesthouses and a 13,600-square-foot mansion.
The estate also features a pool, tennis court, and manicured gardens, as well as a nine-hole golf course and a "motor court" with its own garage and gas pumps, according toArchitectural Digest.Then, in July, Bezos appeared to make another purchase, this time right next door: a $10 million home that shares a hedge line with the Warner estate.
According to property records viewed by bothVarietyandDaily Mail, Bezos is the new owner of the 1930s-era home on a side street in Beverly Hills' Benedict Canyon neighborhood.In February 2021, Bezos announced that he would step down as CEO of Amazon in the third quarter, with Andy Jassy, the CEO of AWS, taking his place.

Many, many years ago, we outlawed PowerPoint presentations at Amazon," Bezos said at theBush Center's Forum on Leadershipin 2018.
And it's probably the smartest thing we ever did.
To replace the PowerPoint presentations, Bezos created a new way to hold meetings: Meetings start with each attendee sitting and silently reading a "six-page, narratively-structured memo" for about the first 30 minutes of the meeting.
The memo is] supposed to create the context for what will then be a good discussion," Bezos said.Those participating are encouraged to take notes, and after the reading period is over, they discuss the memo.Bezos says the reason for the group reading is that "executives will bluff their way through the meeting as if they've read the memo because we're busy and so you've got to actually carve out the time for the memo to get read.
Bezos is not the only CEO to believe in "silent meetings": Twitter and Square CEOJack Dorsey uses a similar method, which includes holding meetings that start with 10 minutes of silent reading from a Google Doc.
Most of my meetings are now Google doc-based, starting with 10 minutes of reading and commenting directly in the doc," Dorsey tweeted in 2018.
This practice makes time for everyone to get on same page, allows us to work from many locations, and gets to truth/critical thinking faster.
As for Amazon, before the memo-based meetings were instituted, "we were doing the more traditional thing," Bezos said.
A junior executive comes in, they put a huge amount of effort into developing a PowerPoint presentation, they put the third slide up, and the most senior executive in the room has already interrupted them, thrown them off their game, asking questions about what is going to be presented in slide six, if they would just stay quiet for a moment..."He explained that PowerPoint slides often have "obscure information."
Bezos prefers memos, he says, because each have "verbs and sentences and topic sentences and complete paragraphs.
In his2017 letter to shareholders, Bezos said by "tradition at Amazon, authors' names never appear on the memos.
The memo is from the whole team.
The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind," he said in the 2017 letter.
They simply can't be done in a day or two.
It] is harder for the author, but it forces the author to clarify their own thinking," he said at the Forum on Leadership.
It totally revolutionizes the way we do meetings at Amazon.

Skip to: Start of Article.Author: Geek's Guide to the Galaxy.Geek's Guide to the GalaxyCultureDate of Publication: 01.26.19.01.26.19Time of Publication: 8:50 am.8:50 amHowStarTrekand Sci-Fi Influenced Jeff BezosJeff Bezos named his dog after aStar Trekcharacter.Franziska Krug/Getty ImagesJeff Bezos is a lifelong science fiction fan.
As a child the Amazon founder spent his summers reading Asimov and Heinlein, and according to Christian Davenport, who profiled Bezos in his bookThe Space Barons, he’s a hardcoreStar Trekfan.“He named his dog Kamala, after one of the characters, and one of his holding companies is Zefram LLC, named for the character inStar Trekwho created the warp drive,” Davenport says in Episode 345 of theGeek’s Guide to the Galaxypodcast.
He even had a cameo in one of theStar Trekfilms.
So that’s obviously a huge influence on him.”Podcasthttps://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/geeksguide345final.mp3RSSiTunesDownloadScience fiction also played a role in the creation ofBlue Origin, the rocket company that Bezos founded in 2000.
The year before, Bezos had watched the movieOctober Sky, about NASA engineer Homer Hickam, with science fiction authorNeal Stephenson.
Afterward they were discussing the film.“[Jeff] says to Neal Stephenson, ‘I’ve always wanted to start a rocket company, that’s always been my dream,'” Davenport says.
And Neal Stephenson just said, ‘Do it.
Do it today.’ And soon thereafter, he did.”Despite his busy schedule, Bezos still makes time to read new science fiction from writers such as Alastair Reynolds, Ernest Cline, and Andy Weir.
I got the sense that that’s important to him, to sort of nourish his mind,” Davenport says.
So he definitely tries to keep up on that stuff.”Bezos has also moved to acquire more science fiction for Amazon’s streaming service.
Novels by Iain Banks, Larry Niven, and Neal Stephenson are all in development, and last spring Amazon savedThe Expanseafter it was canceled by Syfy.“Something that [Jeff] wants to do is not just to have success in space—to make rockets that are reusable—but to reinvigorate interest in space,” Davenport says.
And I thought savingThe Expansewas a great way to do that.”Listen to the complete interview with Christian Davenport in Episode 345 ofGeek’s Guide to the Galaxy(above).
And check out some highlights from the discussion below.Christian Davenport on interviewing Jeff Bezos:“What I found in the archives was the press release from when Jeff’s grandfather left ARPA to go back to work at the Atomic Energy Commission, and the press release had a picture of his grandfather on it—a very big picture.
And so I saw him a few months later and handed him the press release, which he had never seen—and I could see the expression on his face—and I just said, ‘I’m putting my cards on the table.
I’m writing this book, and I’m just really trying to impress you with the level of research I’m doing.’ And then I thought I had him, and he said, ‘I’m inclined to participate.’ Then it took another couple of months of working with his people to get on the schedule, but then I did.”Related StoriesGeek's Guide to the GalaxyBeing a Hollywood Science Consultant Isn’t Exactly GlamorousGeek's Guide to the GalaxyDoctorWhoIs Reaching a Whole New AudienceGeek's Guide to the GalaxySci-Fi Writers Are Grappling With a Post-Trump RealityChristian Davenport on the future:“[Jeff] gives this stump speech about how we shouldgo out to space to preserve Earth, and today the line he says is, ‘Earth should be zoned residential,’ that Earth is this really magnificent place, with waterfalls and palm trees and snow and bacon and wine and whiskey, and all these wonderful things, and that other planets—like Mars, for example—which is whereElon Muskwants to go, are really desolate, and hard places to live.
 So that’s what he talks about today, but when he was 18 years old and giving a speech at his high school, it was virtually the same speech, but instead of saying ‘Earth should be zoned residential’ he said ‘Earth should be preserved as a National Park.’ So obviously this is something he’s been thinking about for a very long time.”Christian Davenport on Blue Origin:“[Jeff] turned to me and he said, ‘Do you know how a bullwhip works?’ And I was like, ‘What do you mean?’ And he said, ‘Well, that crack, there’s a mini sonic boom in there.
You can get the whip to go faster than the speed of sound just with your arm, and the way that works is that momentum is mass times velocity, and so as your mass decreases—toward the end of the whip—your velocity has to increase.’ And so I’m digesting that and letting it sink in, and then I’m like, ‘So you were going to bullwhip people into space?’ And he’s like, ‘Well, no, no, no.
Not people.
But maybe satellites or cargo, and things like that.’ But they could see that this was an idea that wasn’t going to work.”Christian Davenport on the space industry:“What I’ve noticed, just in reporting this over the last five years, is how the investment community is becoming more interested in space.
I think early on space investors were the space geeks, they were the enthusiasts, they were more interested in the dream than they were perhaps in the return on investment.
But now you’ve seen more players get into this.
I mean, the fact that Google and Fidelity invested a billion dollars intoSpaceXshould tell you something, and the fact that companies like Morgan Stanley are talking about it.
Whereas they used to say, ‘The quickest way to become a millionaire in space is to start out as a billionaire,’ now I think people are starting to believe that you can actually make money in space.”More Great WIRED StoriesWeedmaps’ grip on the high-flying Californiapot marketHave phones become boring?

Jeff Bezos and Star Trek: A love affair - The Washington PostAccessibility statementSkip to main contentSearch NavigationDemocracy Dies in DarknessSign inThis article was published more than1yearagoThe Washington PostDemocracy Dies in DarknessPop CultureThe love affair between Jeff Bezos and ‘Star Trek’ByTravis M. AndrewsandRoxanne RobertsUpdatedOctober 13, 2021 at 11:40 a.m. EDT|PublishedOctober 13, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EDTWilliam Shatner in “Star Trek,” circa 1966-1969.
Paramount Television/Kobal/Shutterstock)Listen6 minComment on this storyCommentGiftArticleShareBeam me up, Jeffrey.There’s more than a slight chance those words passed through William Shatner’s mind Wednesday, as the original Captain Kirk headed into space aboard a New Shepard spacecraft owned by Jeff Bezos’s commercial spaceflight venture Blue Origin.
He spent just over 10 minutesrocketing upwardmore than 66 miles — four miles beyond the edge of space — and returning to Earth.WpGet the full experience.Choose your planArrowRightIt was an undoubtedly savvy public relations move for the embattled company, which has recently come under fire for harboring what current and former employees allege, inan essay, is a toxic culture “that ignores the plight of our planet, turns a blind eye to sexism, is not sufficiently attuned to safety concerns, and silences those who seek to correct wrongs.”In fact, as a PR stunt, it’s rivaled only by Blue Origin’s first foray to the cosmos.
That found Wally Funk, an 82-year-old aviation pioneer who was supposed to be one of the first women in space back in 1961, accompanying Bezos and his brother, Mark, into space.
In addition to the “Star Trek” tie-in, the 90-year-old Shatner became the oldest person ever to exit Earth’s atmosphere, a fact that’s basically catnip for headline-seeking journalists.Inside Blue Origin: Employees say toxic, dysfunctional ‘bro culture’ led to mistrust, low morale and delays at Jeff Bezos’s space ventureUndergirding the PR move, though, might be a personal interest.
Bezos has a genuine interest in the “Star Trek” series, which he discusses ad nauseamin interviews and which inspired the name of his dog, Kamala (you know, the Kriosian empathic metamorph).AdvertisementBut when did this love affair begin?
What else has the show inspired in his life?We dove into these questions.
But first, repeat after us: Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.How did Bezos become interested in space?Bezos fell in love with the universe before he fell in love with “Star Trek.” As a boy, he spent summers in Texas with his grandfather, a former Atomic Energy Commission engineer.
The two watched space launches together and shared a love of science fiction.“ ‘Star Trek’ is the easiest thing to glom on to, but it was much more than that,” biographer Brad Stone said in an interview.When he graduated from high school, Bezos ended his valedictorian speech with the words “Space: the final frontier.
Meet me there.”As a student at Princeton, Bezos juggled the pop cultureof “Star Trek” with the more serious work of professor and physicist Gerard O’Neill, who foresaw space stations orbiting Earth to house humans.
After college, Bezos held “Star Trek: The Next Generation” viewing parties for his friends, Stone said.AdvertisementSpace, real or imagined, was always a big part of his life.When did he fall in love with Star Trek?The show premiered — with Shatner as Captain Kirk — in 1966, two years after Bezos was born.
It would take the Amazon founder until the fourth grade to discover the StarshipEnterprise.
When he did, he became infatuated with the show in the way only a child can.“When I was in fourth grade, me and my friends Dean and Kyle, who lived next door a couple of houses down, in Houston, Texas, would play ‘Star Trek’ almost every day,” BezostoldWashington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron at a 2016 event hosted by The Post.
And we’d fight over who’d get to be Captain Kirk, or Spock, and somebody used to play the computer, too.
And it was actually very fun — we’d have little cardboard phasers and cardboard tricorders, you know.
Good days.”Washington Post executive editor Martin Baron interviewed Amazon.com chief executive and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos May 18 at Transformers, a live event by The Washington Post about pushing the boundaries of knowledge.
Video: Washington Post Live)Echoes of the show can be found throughout his life.
In addition to naming his dog Kamala, he named one of his holding companies Zefram LLC after Zefram Cochrane, the character who invented the warp drive.AdvertisementHe’s discussed how the show, and his general love of science fiction, helped inspire him to found a commercial spaceflight venture.
But the show was also instrumental in creating the Amazon Echo.“Our vision, in the long term, is it would become the ‘Star Trek’ computer.
You could ask it anything, ask it to do things for you, ask it to find things for you, and it would be easy to converse with in a very natural way,” he told Baron.
The original inspiration was the ‘Star Trek’ computer.”Who was his favorite character?If you ask an Amazon’s Alexa who’s the best “Star Trek” captain, she will respond, “Of all the captains in all the galaxies, Captain Picard is my favorite.”It’s no coincidence that Bezos feels the same way.
He once gleefully shared that with a tickled Patrick Stewart, the actor who portrayed Picard.View this post on InstagramA post shared by Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos)Though Kirk is the one who traveled  to space Wednesday, Bezos has never shied away from reminding the world that he prefers Picard — usuallyon Twitter.
Kirk or Picard?
Picard!”Bezos tweetedin March 2018, shortly after walking the red carpet with Stewart at the Academy Awards.AdvertisementHe almost named Amazon “Makeitso.com,” after Picard’s catchphrase, Inc.reported.In fact, “as time has passed, Bezos and Picard have physically converged.
Like the interstellar explorer, portrayed by Patrick Stewart, Bezos shaved the remnant strands on his high-gloss pate and acquired a cast-iron physique,” Franklin Foerwrotein the Atlantic in 2019.Bezos has not publicly explained why he admires Picard, but let’s venture a modest guess: Picard is a brilliant officer, historian and diplomat who plays a major role in the events of the 24th century.
Even Spock was impressed: “He’s remarkably analytical and dispassionate, for a human.
 There’s almost a Vulcan quality to the man.”Is it true that he appeared in a ‘Star Trek’ movie?Affirmative!
Bezos played an alien Starfleet officer in the 2016 “Star Trek Beyond,” something he called “a bucket list” dream on Twitter.Advertisement“For years, I have been begging Paramount, which is owned by Viacom, to let me be in a ‘Star Trek’ movie,” he said that year.
I am very persistent, and you can imagine the poor director who got the call: ‘You have to let Jeff Bezos be in your ‘Star Trek’ movie.
Bezos said he was willing to be unrecognizable but wanted a speaking part — and one that was central to the plot so it didn’t end up on the cutting-room floor.Great thing about making Trek is having passionate people drop by, like@JeffBezos.
Here he is with Lydia Wilson.pic.twitter.com/bKkEAmwjDS— Justin Lin (@justinlin)July 20, 2016Bezos appears in the first five minutes of the film as an alien Starfleet officer stationed at Yorktown Starbase in 2263 who scans Kalara as she pleads for help from Commodore Paris and Captain Kirk.
Speak normally,” Bezos tells her.
The cameo role required such extensive makeup that he could only drink through a straw.“He was awesome,” director Justin Lin told the Associated Press.
It was like a president was visiting, you know?
He had a big entourage!
But it didn’t matter because he was so into it.
He had to wait around all day because it was one day we were shooting like three different scenes and, it was also credit to Jeff because … he just nailed it every time.”What other science fiction does he enjoy?Although “Star Trek” is his most public sci-fi obsession, it’s far from his only one.
As a child, Bezos would hoover up all the Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein books he could get his hands on.
Nowadays, he makes sure to read newer genre writers such as Alastair Reynolds, Ernest Cline and Andy Weir.AdvertisementAmazon Studios, the film and TV arm of his online empire, has focused on producing sci-fi.
Most notably, the service saved “The Expanse,” a beloved show based on the novels of James S.A. Corey after it was canceled by its original network, Syfy.“Something that [Bezos] wants to do is not just to have success in space — to make rockets that are reusable — but to reinvigorate interest in space,” The Post’s Christian Davenport said on theGeek’s Guide to the Galaxypodcast.According to Davenport’sreporting, Bezos decided to found Blue Origin after watching “October Sky,” a movie about NASA engineer Homer Hickam, with science fiction writer Neal Stephenson.
But, by that point, he had long been interested in space.As his high school girlfriend Ursula Werneronce said: “Jeff started Amazon just to get enough money to do Blue Origin.
He was intrigued by the idea of rocketing into outer space.”“I can neither confirm nor deny that,” Bezoslater said, when asked about her theory.In any event, we know one thing for sure: Live long and profit.CommentsGiftOutlineGift ArticleMore on Blue OriginHAND CURATEDInside Blue Origin: Employees say toxic, dysfunctional ‘bro culture’ led to mistrust, low morale and delays at Jeff Bezos’s space ventureOctober 11, 2021Inside Blue Origin: Employees say toxic, dysfunctional ‘bro culture’ led to mistrust, low morale and delays at Jeff Bezos’s space ventureOctober 11, 2021Blue Origin fired a senior executive, citing inappropriate behavior.

The billionaire has made no secret of his ambition to relocate humans to massive spinning space colonies akin to the ships in his favorite sci-fi television series, Star Trek.
It eventually led to his founding of Blue Origin in the year 2000.In fact, Star Trek has been a thread of inspiration for many decisions over the years.
In 2016, hetoldthe Washington Post that he modeled Amazon's Echo deviceafter the voice activated talking computers on Starship Enterprise.Long before that, Bezos considered naming his trillion dollar e-commerce company 'MakeItSo.com,' as a tribute to a catch phrase used by his hero, the fictional character, 'Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
Over the years, Bezos has slowly modeled his image off Picard's look.
Sometime in 2013, Bezos shaved the residue strands on his balding hairline to copy the look of his interstellar idol.Driving Jeff Bezos' vision to colonize space is the product his lifelong obsession with Star Trek and sci-fi novels.

This electric-powered pooch can run for 90 minutes before recharging and weighs around 55 pounds (25 kg).
SpotMini made headlines in Feb 2018, when a video of it opening a door despite a human trying to stop it, as a showcase of how robots will eventually take over the world.Taking my new dog for a walk at the #MARS2018 conference.

He is best known for being the founder, CEO and chairman of leading online retailer Amazon.
With a net worth of $130 billion, he is noted as the world’s richest person and the first person to be worth over $100 billion.Will Jeff Bezos bring his dogs to space next?In July 2021, Jeff Bezos flew to space in his ship, Blue Origin, and became one of the first billionaires to fly into space on their own rocket.
He launched a second flight in October 2021 withWilliam Shatneras part of the crew on the second manned launch.
At 90, Shatner was the oldest person ever aboard a space flight.Now, the only question we have is: Will Jeff Bezoseverbring dogs to space?
He’s invitedTom Hanksamongst other celebrities but what we really want to see are more astronaut pooches, even if it just Spot Minithe robot dog.
And, we know he’s cool with them being in theAmazon headquarters.Bezos’ space flight was the second of celebrity space flights withRichard Bransonbeating him out by nine days.
Branson’s Virgin Galactic managed heights of 54 miles while Bezos’Blue Origin reached 66 miles.
So, if you were going to declare a winner in the epic celebrity space odyssey, you would have to factor in a couple of things.
For us, the best celebrity space flight will have to be one with dog astronauts.
No question.Who is Jeff Bezos?
A Brief HistorySince a young age, Bezos always showed an interesting in science and technology, eventually graduating from Princeton University with Bachelor of Science degrees in computer science and electrical engineering.
After graduating, he found work in telecommunications and then banking.After finding success in banking through his 20s, he left to launch his first online venture with an online bookstore named “Amazon” out of his garage.
He always planned to expand from books to other products, eventually doing so through capital raised in 1998.
After several rough years in the early 2000s, Amazon eventually turned around in 2003 and has grown steadily since.
He is also known for founding Blue Origin, a human spaceflight startup and for buyingThe Washington Postfor $250 million cash in 2013.More Jeff BezosTwitterInstagramPet ArticlesRelatedFiona the Baby Hippo of The Cincinnati Zoo is the Official Queen of the SummerHaiku The Husky a Singing Dog Performing Microphone Woos Near YouDolly Parton launches perfectly named dog accessories brand "Doggy Parton"America’s Got Talent Pam and Casper the Singing ChihuahuaTom Hardy writes heartfelt tribute to his dog Woody who just passed awayGiant Tortoise Causes $150,000 Worth of Damage to Neighbors HomeAn otter and two pandas praised for predicting World Cup 2022 match winnersCelebrity couple Beth and Howard Stern uses 90 million dollar fortune to foster hundreds of catsCelebrity PetsRelatedFiona Apple PetsEden Brolin PetsNick Carter PetsCole Hauser PetsAlexander Ovechkin PetsGeorge Russell PetsJermaine Dupri PetsEd Sheeran PetsJimmy Garoppolo PetsNicholas Galitzine PetsSean Hannity PetsForest Whitaker PetsMenuHomeArticlesFeature My PetTerms Of UseAbout UsContact UsDMCAPrivacy PolicyPopular TagsActorsMusiciansAthletesCreatorsComediansDogsCatsBirdsCrittersHorsesTop© 2023 Celebrity Pets / All Rights Reserved.

                                            Amazon Staff7 minFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedIn ShareEmail ShareWritten byAmazon StaffFacebook ShareTwitter ShareLinkedIn ShareEmail Share“Jeff, what does Day 2 look like?”That’s a question I just got at our most recent all-hands meeting.
I’ve been reminding people that it’s Day 1 for a couple of decades.
I work in an Amazon building named Day 1, and when I moved buildings, I took the name with me.
I spend time thinking about this topic.“Day 2 is stasis.
Followed by irrelevance.
Followed by excruciating, painful decline.
Followed by death.
Andthatis why it isalwaysDay 1.”To be sure, this kind of decline would happen in extreme slow motion.
An established company might harvest Day 2 for decades, but the final result would still come.I’m interested in the question, how do you fend off Day 2?
What are the techniques and tactics?
How do you keep the vitality of Day 1, even inside a large organization?Such a question can’t have a simple answer.
There will be many elements, multiple paths, and many traps.
I don’t know the whole answer, but I may know bits of it.
Here’s a starter pack of essentials for Day 1 defense: customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends, and high-velocity decision making.True Customer ObsessionThere are many ways to center a business.
You can be competitor focused, you can be product focused, you can be technology focused, you can be business model focused, and there are more.
But in my view, obsessive customer focus is by far the most protective of Day 1 vitality.Why?
There are many advantages to a customer-centric approach, but here’s the big one: customers arealwaysbeautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is great.
Even when they don’t yet know it, customers want something better, and your desire to delight customers will drive you to invent on their behalf.
No customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime membership program, but it sure turns out they wanted it, and I could give you many such examples.Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when you see customer delight.
A customer-obsessed culture best creates the conditions where all of that can happen.Resist ProxiesAs companies get larger and more complex, there’s a tendency to manage to proxies.
This comes in many shapes and sizes, and it’s dangerous, subtle, and very Day 2.A common example is process as proxy.
Good process serves you so you can serve customers.
But if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing.
This can happen very easily in large organizations.
The process becomes the proxy for the result you want.
You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you’re doing the process right.
Gulp.
It’s not that rare to hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, “Well, we followed the process.” A more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity to investigate and improve the process.
The process is not the thing.
It’s always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us?
In a Day 2 company, you might find it’s the second.Another example: market research and customer surveys can become proxies for customers – something that’s especially dangerous when you’re inventing and designing products.
Fifty-five percent of beta testers report being satisfied with this feature.
That is up from 47% in the first survey.” That’s hard to interpret and could unintentionally mislead.Good inventors and designersdeeplyunderstand their customer.
They spend tremendous energy developing that intuition.
They study and understand many anecdotes rather than only the averages you’ll find on surveys.
Theylivewith the design.I’m not against beta testing or surveys.
But you, the product or service owner, must understand the customer, have a vision, and love the offering.
Then, beta testing and research can help you find your blind spots.
A remarkable customer experience starts with heart, intuition, curiosity, play, guts, taste.
You won’t find any of it in a survey.Embrace External TrendsThe outside world can push you into Day 2 if you won’t or can’t embrace powerful trends quickly.
If you fight them, you’re probably fighting the future.
Embrace them and you have a tailwind.These big trends are not that hard to spot (they get talked and written about a lot), but they can be strangely hard for large organizations to embrace.
We’re in the middle of an obvious one right now: machine learning and artificial intelligence.Over the past decades computers have broadly automated tasks that programmers could describe with clear rules and algorithms.
Modern machine learning techniques now allow us to do the same for tasks where describing the precise rules is much harder.At Amazon, we’ve been engaged in the practical application of machine learning for many years now.
Some of this work is highly visible: our autonomous Prime Air delivery drones; the Amazon Go convenience store that uses machine vision to eliminate checkout lines; and Alexa,1our cloud-based AI assistant.
We still struggle to keep Echo in stock, despite our best efforts.
A high-quality problem, but a problem.
We’re working on it.
But much of what we do with machine learning happens beneath the surface.
Machine learning drives our algorithms for demand forecasting, product search ranking, product and deals recommendations, merchandising placements, fraud detection, translations, and much more.
Though less visible, much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type – quietly but meaningfully improving core operations.Inside AWS, we’re excited to lower the costs and barriers to machine learning and AI so organizations of all sizes can take advantage of these advanced techniques.Using our pre-packaged versions of popular deep learning frameworks running on P2 compute instances (optimized for this workload), customers are already developing powerful systems ranging everywhere from early disease detection to increasing crop yields.
And we’ve also made Amazon’s higher level services available in a convenient form.
Amazon Lex (what’s inside Alexa), Amazon Polly, and Amazon Rekognition remove the heavy lifting from natural language understanding, speech generation, and image analysis.
They can be accessed with simple API calls – no machine learning expertise required.
Watch this space.
Much more to come.High-Velocity Decision MakingDay 2 companies make high-qualitydecisions, but they make high-quality decisionsslowly.
To keep the energy and dynamism of Day 1, you have to somehow make high-quality,high-velocitydecisions.
Easy for start-ups and very challenging for large organizations.
The senior team at Amazon is determined to keep our decision-making velocity high.
Speed matters in business – plus a high-velocity decision making environment is more fun too.
We don’t know all the answers, but here are some thoughts.First, never use a one-size-fits-all decision-making process.
Many decisions are reversible, two-way doors.
Those decisions can use a light-weight process.
For those, so what if you’re wrong?
I wrote about this in more detail in last year’s letter.Second, most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had.
If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re probably being slow.
Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions.
If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.Third, use the phrase “disagree and commit.” This phrase will save a lot of time.
If you have conviction on a particular direction even though there’s no consensus, it’s helpful to say, “Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it?
Disagree and commit?” By the time you’re at this point, no one can know the answer for sure, and you’ll probably get a quick yes.This isn’t one way.
If you’re the boss, you should do this too.
I disagree and commit all the time.
We recently greenlit a particular Amazon Studios original.
I told the team my view: debatable whether it would be interesting enough, complicated to produce, the business terms aren’t that good, and we have lots of other opportunities.
They had a completely different opinion and wanted to go ahead.
I wrote back right away with “I disagree and commit and hope it becomes the most watched thing we’ve ever made.” Consider how much slower this decision cycle would have been if the team had actually had toconvinceme rather than simply get my commitment.Note what this example is not: it’s not me thinking to myself “well, these guys are wrong and missing the point, but this isn’t worth me chasing.” It’s a genuine disagreement of opinion, a candid expression of my view, a chance for the team to weigh my view, and a quick, sincere commitment to go their way.
And given that this team has already brought home 11 Emmys, 6 Golden Globes, and 3 Oscars, I’m just glad they let me in the room at all!Fourth, recognize truemisalignmentissues early and escalate themimmediately.
Sometimes teams have different objectives and fundamentally different views.
They are not aligned.
No amount of discussion, no number of meetings will resolve that deep misalignment.
Without escalation, the default dispute resolution mechanism for this scenario is exhaustion.
Whoever has more stamina carries the decision.I’ve seen many examples of sincere misalignment at Amazon over the years.
When we decided to invite third party sellers to compete directly against us on our own product detail pages – that was a big one.
Many smart, well-intentioned Amazonians were simply not at all aligned with the direction.
The big decision set up hundreds of smaller decisions, many of which needed to be escalated to the senior team.“You’ve worn me down” is an awful decision-making process.
It’s slow and de-energizing.
Go for quick escalation instead – it’s better.So, have you settled only for decision quality, or are you mindful of decision velocity too?
Are the world’s trends tailwinds for you?
Are you falling prey to proxies, or do they serve you?
And most important of all, are you delighting customers?
We can have the scope and capabilities of a large company and the spirit and heart of a small one.
But we have to choose it.A huge thank you to each and every customer for allowing us to serve you, to our shareowners for your support, and to Amazonians everywhere for your hard work, your ingenuity, and your passion.As always,I attach a copy of our original 1997 letter.
It remains Day 1.Sincerely,JeffJeffrey P.

Jeff BezosAmazon founderJeff Bezosis the second richest person in the world, behind Tesla founderElon Musk.
While Amazon and Bezos are household names with his various other business endeavors, including sending William Shatner and Michael Strahan to space on his sub-orbital spaceflight service,Blue Origin, the former Amazon CEO came from humble beginnings.In fact, Bezos' father, Miguel Bezos, migrated to the United States from Cuba, which had a great impact on his son's entrepreneurial drive.
Working with the Statue of Liberty Ellis Island Foundation, Bezos honored his dad at the 2022 Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Awards, explaining, "He spoke no English, he had to make his way," at the event.
He had those tough experiences.
I think in every immigrant you'll find a deep optimism and a deep resilience too.
View this post on InstagramA post shared by Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island (@statueellisfdn)As the child of an immigrant, Bezos' rise to success is a true American dream.Keep scrolling for more details on how Bezos made Amazon what it is today.How did Jeff Bezos start Amazon?In 1994, formerAmazon CEO Jeff Bezoswas already extremely successful by most peoples standards.
The youngest-ever senior vice president at Wall Street investment bankDE Shaw & Co., the then 30-year-oldPrinceton Universitygraduate was already making an estimated six-figure salary and was destined to rise even further in the company ranks.
But Bezos had other plans.Fueled by a secret passion for the infant business of electronic retailing, Bezos dreamed of creating his own company in the vast, then virtually uncharted wilds of the World Wide Web.
It was a risky move, but it quickly paid off.
Just four years after Bezos created Amazon.com, the virtual bookstore became the template for how e-commerce businesses should be run, with sales of more than $610 million and more than 13 million customers worldwide.Bezos first got the idea to start an Internet enterprise in 1994.
While surfing the Internet in search of new ventures for D E Shaw to invest in, he came across the statistic that World Wide Web usage was growing by 2,300 percent a month.
Bezos immediately recognized the expansive possibilities of selling online and began exploring the entrepreneurial possibilities of developing an Internet business.He drew up a list of 20 potential products he thought might sell well via the Internet, including software, CDs and books.
After reviewing the list, books were the obvious choice, primarily because of the sheer number of titles in existence.
Bezos realized that while even the largest superstores could stock only a few hundred thousand books, a mere fraction of what is available, a "virtual" bookstore could offer millions of titles.
The die was cast.
Bezos passed up a fat bonus, packed his wife,MacKenzie Bezos, and their dog, Kamala (named after an obscure "Star Trek" character), and headed for Seattle.For Bezos, Seattle was the ideal city for his new business.
Not only was it home to a tremendous pool of high-tech talent, it was also in close proximity to Ingram Book Group's Oregon warehouse.
While MacKenzie drove, Jeff spent the trip pecking out a business plan on a laptop computer and calling prospective investors on a cell phone.
With $1 million raised from family and friends, Bezos rented a house in Seattle and set up his business in the garage.For nearly a year, Bezos and a crew of five employees worked out of the garage, learning how to source books and setting up a computer system that would makeAmazon.comeasy to navigate.
A true marketing visionary, in addition to creating a user-friendly interface that would streamline the "needle in a haystack" process that bookstore shopping often entails, Bezos wanted to establish a "virtual community" where visitors could "hang out."
To achieve this goal, he and his team created a number of innovative programs, including one that would let customers add their own book reviews to the site and a feature that recommends books based on a customer's previous purchases.In July 1995, Amazon.com opened its virtual doors, calling itself "Earth's Biggest Book Store," with more than 1 million titles to choose from.
Fueled by word of mouth, or more accurately, word of e-mail, Amazon.com rocketed off the line like a nitro-burning dragster.
Enraptured by the enormous selection of books, the superior customer service and the user-friendly design of the site, Internet users ecstatically plugged Amazon.com on Internet newsgroups and mailing lists.The orders poured in, and by September 1996, Amazon.com had grown into a company of 100 employees and had racked up more than $15.7 million in sales.
Three years later, those figures would rocket to more than 3,000 employees (including some in Britain and Germany) and more than $610 million in sales.Amazon's success did not go unnoticed by bookstore giant Barnes & Noble, who quickly put up its own website.
To combat Amazon's claim that it was "Earth's Biggest Bookstore," Barnes & Noble embarked on an aggressive marketing campaign proclaiming that they offered twice as many books as Amazon.
But it was a strategy doomed to failure.
The forward-thinking Bezos had already expanded Amazon's product line to include CDs and replaced "Earth's Biggest Book Store" with the tagline "Books, Music and More," leaving Barnes & Noble, as one writer put it, "wrapping its fingers around the neck of a phantom.
While Amazon has left its closest competitor in the dust, the company set its sights on conquering all of online retail.
In 2019, it was believed that Amazon controlled 37% of all online retail sales, thanks to the company's relentless expansion and acquisition strategy.
In late January 1999, Amazon went after the $150 billion U.S. pharmacy market, buying a share of Drugstore.com, a company that sells everything from breath mints to Viagra online.
They have since deepened their footprint in the healthcare world.
In 2018, Amazon acquired PillPack, an online full-service pharmacy.
Plus, in addition to Amazon's continual expansion, Bezos also launchedAmazon Web Servicesproviding on-demand cloud computing platforms, and he ownsThe Washington Postamong many other business endeavors.How much of Amazon does Jeff Bezos own?Previously owning 16 percent of the company, the Amazon employee sold $8.8 billion worth of his Amazon stock after stepping back as Amazon CEO to become executive chairman in July 2021.
Despite owning less than 10 percent of the company today, his net worth is estimates to be a whopping $171 billion, per Forbes.Prior to leaving his position as CEO, Bezos went through a very public divorce with his now ex-wife MacKenzie Scott in 2019.
After 25 years of marriage, MacKenzie received 4 percent of Amazon in the settlement valued at $38 billion.
Since their split, MacKenzie went on to marry Seattle school teacher Dan Jewett in March 2021, while the Amazon founder has been dating girlfriend Lauren Sanchez since 2019.What is Jeff Bezos doing now?Now with more time on his hands, Bezos is of course philanthropic thanks to hisBezos Family Foundation, however, he's still very much embroiled in the criticism wealthy corporations like his garner on the issue of corporate taxes.In fact, president Joe Biden slammed organizations like his via Twitter as tensions around inflation rise.
You want to bring down inflation?
Let's make sure the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share," President Biden tweeted on May 13, 2022, to which Bezos replied, "Raising corp taxes is fine to discuss.
Taming inflation is critical to discuss.
Mushing them together is just misdirection.
The newly created Disinformation Board should review this tweet, or maybe they need to form a new Non Sequitur Board instead.
Raising corp taxes is fine to discuss.
Mushing them together is just misdirection.https://t.co/ye4XiNNc2v— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos)May 14, 2022Although Amazon didn't pay federal income tax in 2017 and 2018, Bezos doesn't think big business are to blame for inflation.
They know inflation hurts the neediest the most.
But unions aren't causing inflation and neither are wealthy people," Bezos added in response to the White House and Biden administration.Entrepreneur Editors' PicksZooey DeschanelEmbraces the Word 'Quirky'and Thinks Businesses Should TooASimple (But Not Easy) Guideto Achieving Almost Any DreamMaking Time to Be 'Useless'Is a Vital Part of CreatingAnything ValuableA Billionaire Who Operates More Than 2,400 Franchises KnowsThese Types of FranchiseesMake the Most MoneyHowRelentless OptimismFuels Success for Hilary Schneider, CEO of ShutterflyThe Paradox ofCelebrity TequilaSocial Media Was Draining Me, SoI Gave It Up.My Business Has Never Been Stronger.Free Guidebook: How to Buy the Right Franchise For YouDiscover tips and advice straight from the pros about finding your ideal franchise that matches your interests, goals, and financial needs in our Entrepreneur Insights guidebook.

Gise divorced Jorgensen in 1965, and in 1968 married Mike Bezos.In a video he tweeted Thursday, Jeff Bezos, who is currently worth $117 billion, according to theBloomberg Billionaires Index, commends his father's bravery.TWEET videoIn the video, Jeff Bezos says he has "a hard time even imagining" arriving in a new country with no family.
He says his father's parents sent him because under Cuba's then-leader Fidel Castro, "they felt like they had to, to protect him.
My parents were not allowed to go into the airport with me, so they dropped me off," says Mike Bezos in the video, a more complete version of which is available onAmazon.
I got on an airplane and landed in Miami 45 minutes later.
Mike Bezos says he could only bring with him three pairs of pants, three shirts, three pairs of underwear and one pair of shoes.And then there was his coat.
His mom imagined America must be super cold.
So she made him something special for his journey, which we still have," Jeff Bezos says in the video.
Out of those cleaning rags and knitting materials, she made — with the help of my sister — she made a coat," says Mike.
In her mind, I needed a heavy coat.
TY TWEETBezos' father first stayed in Camp Matecumbe, a refugee camp in Florida, for three weeks.
He was later sent to Wilmington, Delaware to attend high school, where he got a scholarship to go to college in Albuquerque.
I had very little idea at that time where Albuquerque was," Mike says.
That is where he met Gise and her son Jeff.
It is truly unbelievable.
I look back on my life and I had lived the American Dream 30 years ago," Mike Bezos says.
It is really just out of this world.

So, who are the parents of the boy who would become the wealthiest person on earth?
Here’s what we know.Jeff Bezos was born in New Mexico on January 12, 1964.

His biological parents, Jacklyn Gise and Ted Jorgensen, were only 17 and 18 years old respectively, according to Business Insider.
At the time of his birth, Bezos’ mum was still a high school student and his dad performed in a circus.Jeff Bezos’ mum Jacklyn Gise had her son at 17.

The school eventually permitted her to finish her studies under specific conditions, such as not being able to talk to other students or have lunch in the cafeteria.
Gise complied with the rules and even attended night classes where she could bring baby Bezos with her.Jeff Bezos’ parents, Jacklyn Gise and Miguel Bezos.

A few years later, Jacklyn met Miguel Bezos while attending night school, according to CNBC, and in 1968 the couple married, with Miguel adopting the future tech billionaire.In a 2014 Inside Edition interview, Jeff’s biological dad recounted the last time he saw his toddler son: “I was working in a Walmart and I remember them coming to visit me for some reason.” Jeff was only about three years old and the two never saw each other in person again.
At the time of the interview, Jorgensen was a bike shop owner who didn’t know Jeff was his son until biographers contacted him.
He passed away in 2015.Jeff Bezos was embraced with open arms by his stepfather Miguel Bezos.
Photo: @JeffBezos/TwitterThe name Bezos comes from his stepfather, who had fled Communist CubaAfter Jacklyn and Miguel wed, the family moved to Houston, Texas and Miguel adopted Jeff, passing on his last name.

Photo: @JeffBezos/TwitterSpeaking at the event, an emotional Jeff praised his immigrant father as an exemplary role model: “They [immigrants] also end up having a belief in America.
They think this place creates opportunity and it does.
That’s certainly the story of my dad.
He came from Santiago, Cuba.”He went on to talk about how his dad was only 16 when he arrived and spoke no English: “He had to make his way.
He had those tough experiences.
I think in every immigrant you’ll find a deep optimism and a deep resilience too.
My dad is an intense hard worker.
My dad is warm and he teaches an easy smile.
My brother and sister and I could not have had a better role model.”Jeff Bezos showed entrepreneurial spirit from a young age.

Besides simply raising the world’s first centibillionaire-in-the-making, Jacklyn and Mike were financially instrumental in Jeff’s success.
As reported by British tabloids, in the mid 1990s Jeff approached his parents with a proposal to invest in his new internet business venture.Jeff Bezos with his mother Jacklyn, who raised him as a teen parent.

By 2020, Bezos has transformed this into US$1 trillion!
Though the investment came with a great deal of risk, Bezos was clear and upfront with his parents about this.
As per CNBC, Jeff admitted that there was as much as a 70 per cent chance that they might never get their money back.The Bezos family.

By 1999 already, according to CNBC, Bezos had built an estimated net worth of around US$9 billion.Jeff Bezos’ dad Miguel, aka Mike, chipped in over US$200,000 to invest in Amazon during its early stages, and it paid off very well.
Photo: @jeffbezos/InstagramAlthough the amount of Amazon stock Jeff’s parents hold is unclear, in 2018 Bloomberg estimated that, thanks to their investment, the couple alone could be worth US$30 billion, by now likely much more.
That indicates the parents’ return on their investment was around an incredible 12 million per cent.Dr Nicole Martin and her partner Anthony Lopez star in Real Housewives of Miami.

The property was reportedly not on the market when Mike and Jacklyn made their offer, but the RHOM stars presumably couldn’t pass up such an attractive deal.Dr Nicole Martin posing in the mansion she and her partner sold to Jacklyn and Miguel Bezos.

He built an online bookseller into e-commerce giant Amazon, with a current market cap of nearly$947 billion.
It took hard work and ingenuity, but it also takes something else to be successful, according to Bezos: luck.
I feel very strongly that I've won a lot of lotteries," Bezos said at theBush Center's Forum on Leadershipin 2018.
Amazon is one of the lotteries I won."Another?
Having a great support system.
I think one of the precursors of being able to take risk is to have some kind of support from somebody," he said.
You have to have some mentors, you have to have somebody that loves you.
These are the kind of things that build up and allow you to jump off into uncharted terrain and do something new, because you know you have a support system.
In Bezos' case, he said, "I had a big lottery with my parents.
Despite being a divorced, teenage mom, Bezos' mother Jackie "made it work."
Her parents, my grandparents, helped her and made that all work," Bezos said at the Bush Center in 2018.
Mike Bezos, the man who raised him (Bezos' biological father left when he was a baby), is "a great guy," Bezos said.
My dad is a Cuban immigrant.
He came here when he was16 years old.
He didn't speak any English.
And Bezos' parents believed in their son.
Theyinvested$245,573 in Amazon in 1995, according to a1997 prospectus.
If you don't get that kind of support somehow – it doesn't have to be your parents, sometimes people get lucky and it's the grandparent, or a friend, or a family friend, or a teacher.
But you need that.
Somebody has to step into your life.
Bezos isn't the only billionaire who acknowledges the role luck plays in success.Mark Zuckerberg has said his family's financial and other support is abig part of what allowed him to found Facebook.
The greatest successes come from having the freedom to fail," Zuckerberg said in aHarvard Universitycommencement speech in 2017.
If ...
I didn't know I'd be fine ifFacebookdidn't work out, I wouldn't be standing here today.
If we're honest, we all know how much luck we've had," he said.And Warren Buffett often says he won the"ovarian lottery.
The womb from which you emerge determines your fate to an enormous degree for most of the seven billion people in the world," Buffett toldjournalist Rebecca Jarvis in 2013.Buffett said that he and Charlie Munger were born "wired in a certain way," at the 1997 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting, "which we had nothing to do with, [and] that happens to enable us to be good at valuing businesses.
And, you know, is that the greatest talent in the world?
It just happens to be something that pays off like crazy in this system.

It symobilizes a website link url.Copy LinkRead in appRedeem nowAmazon CEO Jeff BezosMichael Seto/Business InsiderAmazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos spoke at our IGNITION conference today.On stage, he was asked about Google's famous perks which include free food, massages, laundry, and so on.
It's like a cruise more than it's like a job in that aspect.Amazon (just as famously) doesn't offer similar perks like free food and massages.Bezos minimized the importance of those perks for attracting top talent.
He said that if you were to give job advice to your niece, would you tell her to go find the company with the best massages?Of course not, you would go find the most interesting work.However, Bezos also said he rejects the idea that Amazon doesn't take care of its employees: "We have great amenities, they're just not the same as what some other companies do.
What are those amenities?He said Amazon is in the heart of Seattle, which means employees can live in a great city, and walk to work.
There are good food carts that show up at Amazon's headquarters that provide a variety of food (that employees have to pay for).You can open the windows in the office, which is actually harder than you think to make happen, says Bezos.
He had to fight the HVAC people on it.
They would say, "What if someone leaves it open when it's raining?"
Bezos' response: "What if they put bugs in our code?
At least, we can see the open windows!
Amazon also allows people to bring dogs to the office, which is a nice, comforting thing for employees.These may not sound as fantastic as the perks offered by Amazon's rivals, but the bottom line to Bezos is that Amazon offers amenities, and most important satisfying work.Sign up for notifications from Insider!

Today, Amazon is an ecommerce behemoth worth $1.8 trillion, and that company has made him the richest person in the world with a fortune worth over$200 billion.Over Bezos' roughly 27 years as CEO, he's regularly shared advice and lessons learned in interviews and his annual letters to Amazon shareholders.Here are some of the best examples of what Bezos, 57, has shared over the years.Take risks"When you think about the things that you will regret when you're 80, they're almost always the things that you did not do.
They're acts of omission.
Very rarely are you going to regret something that you did that failed and didn't work or whatever," Bezos said in a2018 interview.That philosophy helped shape Bezos' life before he even launched Amazon.
When he was just 30 years old, Bezos had a Wall Street job at hedge fund D. E. Shaw, but he saw promise in the future of the internet economy and got the idea to build a bookstore online.
Bezos' boss agreed the idea had potential, but he still tried to convince Bezos that it would be less of a risk to keep the job he had.
I pictured myself [at] 80 years old, thinking back on my life in a quiet moment of reflection," Bezos said of that moment in his life during a2020 fireside chat in India.
Would I regret leaving this company in the middle of the year?
And walking away from my annual bonus?
Of course, Bezos decided to go for it, and he moved across the country to start Amazon out ofa garage in the Seattle suburbsin the summer of 1994.
The website went live a year later, onJuly 16, 1995.
I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing.
And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all,"Bezos saidin 2018.
So he "took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.
Picturing yourself as an 80-year-old looking back on your life and the choices you might regret also works for personal decisions, Bezos added.
I'm not just talking about business things," he said.
It's like, 'I love that person and I never told them,' and you know, 50 years later you're like, 'Why didn't I tell her?
Why didn't I go after it?
So that's the kind of life regret that is very hard to be happy about when you're telling yourself, in a private moment, that story of your life.
VIDEO15:1615:16How I built Blavity, a media empire for Black millennialsMake ItMake good decisions — fastBezos believesthat the key to maintaining an innovative business is to make "high-quality,high-velocitydecisions.
In his2015 letter to Amazon shareholders, Bezos wrote about the importance of speed and "nimbleness" in making Amazon "a large company that's also an invention machine."
While he admits that some decisions are "irreversible or nearly irreversible," most are not.
Most decisions ... are changeable, reversible – they're two-way doors," he wrote.
In those cases, when you make a decision that is "suboptimal," according to Bezos, "you don't have to live with the consequences for that long.
You can reopen the door and go back through.
Those types of decisions should be made "quickly," according to Bezos.
Otherwise, he wrote, people or companies that spend too much time deliberating over reversible decisions risk being subject to "slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention.
All of my best decisions in business and in life have been made with heart, intuition, guts — not [with] analysis,"Bezos saidin an interview at the Economic Club Washington D.C. in 2018.Finding your callingFiguring out your passion in life is a central point in the advice that Bezos says he most often gives to his younger employees, as well as his four children, the billionairesaidat the George W. Bush Presidential Center's Forum on Leadership in 2018.
You can have a job, or you can have a career, or you can have a calling," Bezos said.
And if you can somehow figure out how to have a calling, you have hit the jackpot, because that's the big deal.
In other words, finding a way to make a career out of your passion is Bezos' idea of true success.
And, he believes that everyone has a passion.
You don't choose your passions, your passions choose you," he said at the time.
All of us are gifted with certain passions, and the people who are lucky are the ones who get to follow those things.
While Bezos has said he followed his passion as a "garage inventor" when he launched Amazon, in recent years the billionaire admitted that his real lifelong passion has been space.
Ever since I was 5 years old — that's when Neil Armstrong stepped onto the surface of the moon — I've been passionate about space, rockets, rocket engines, space travel,"he saidin 2019.
Bezos' high school graduation speecheven mentioned his plans to one day build space colonies.
Bezos hasspent billions of dollarsfunding his space company, Blue Origin, and one of his first orders of business after stepping down as Amazon CEO will be to fly on the company'sfirst passenger spaceflightwith his brother on July 20.Embrace the inefficiency of wanderingIn his2018 letter to Amazon shareholders, Bezos included a section titled, "Intuition, curiosity, and the power of wandering."
In that section, the Amazon CEO wrote about the importance of setting aside time to explore your curiosity in order to come up with new, innovative solutions to challenges.Amazon's business may depend on efficiency, with customers ordering almost any product and expecting it delivered to their door within a few days or less.
But, Bezos believes thata healthy dose of inefficiencyis necessary to succeed.
In the letter, he describes this as "wandering," or exploring and experimenting even if it means taking a roundabout path to a solution.
Wandering is an essential counter-balance to efficiency," he said.
You need to employ both.
Sometimes (often actually) in business, you do know where you're going, and when you do, you can be efficient.
Put in place a plan and execute," Bezos wrote in the letter.
In contrast, wandering in business is not efficient … but it's also not random," he continued.
It's guided — by hunch, gut, intuition, curiosity, and powered by a deep conviction that the prize for customers is big enough that it's worth being a little messy and tangential to find our way there.
According to Bezos, one of the lessons he'd learned building Amazon was "that success can come through iteration: invent, launch, reinvent, relaunch, start over, rinse, repeat, again and again," he wrote, adding that "the path to success is anything but straight.
Don't lose your distinctivenessIn April, in hisfinal letter to shareholdersas Amazon's CEO,Bezos wroteabout the importance of holding onto your "originality.
We all know that distinctiveness – originality – is valuable," Bezos wrote.
We are all taught to 'be yourself.'
What I'm really asking you to do is to embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness.
The world wants you to be typical – in a thousand ways, it pulls at you.
Don't let it happen.
Bezos went on to say that "it's worth it" to maintain your distinctiveness, even though it requires "continuous hard work.
The fairy tale version of [the advice] 'be yourself' is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine.
That version is misleading.
Being yourself is worth it, but don't expect it to be easy or free," Bezos wrote.Since stepping down as CEO, Bezos transitioned to be executive chairman of Amazon's board and has said he is moving on to focus on projects like Blue Origin.
On Tuesday, July 20,Bezos will even make his first trip to spaceaboard Blue Origin's first-ever passenger spaceflight.Sign up now:Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletterDon't miss:Jeff Bezos steps down as Amazon CEO — look inside the Seattle house where he started the companyValedictorian Jeff Bezos said he wanted to build 'space hotels and colonies' in his 1982 high school graduation speechVIDEO12:0612:06Why more men are becoming stay-at-home dadsMake ItStay in the loopGet Make It newsletters delivered to your inboxSign UpAbout UsLearn more about the world of CNBC Make ItLearn MoreFollow UsCNBC.COMJoin the CNBC Panel©2023CNBC LLC.

His mother Jacklyn, who became became pregnant with Bezosat 16, remembers his fascination with discovering the way machines and toys worked.
I knew early on that he was wired a little bit differently,"she says.
When he tried to take his crib apart with a screwdriver, I think that cinched it.
tweetSo when 16-year-old Jeff got a summer job frying up burgers at McDonald's in 1980, he learned all he could from the experience.Jeff Bezos | Instagram"I was a cook,"Bezos told Fast Company.
They wouldn't let me anywhere near the customers.
This was my acned-teenager stage.
They were like, 'Hmm, why don't you work in the back?'"
he joked.As a "grill man," the most challenging thing for Bezos "was keeping everything going at the right pace during a rush," he told Cody Teets, author of "Golden Opportunity: Remarkable Careers That Began at McDonald's.
The experience was Bezos' first hands-on brush with retail,according to Wired, and he spent the summer "studying the company's automation improvements," like beeps and signals for when to "scramble his eggs, flip his burgers, and pull his fries out of the boiling vat.
The job also gave him early insight into customer service: "I learned that it's really hard," he told Fast Company.
Today, "customer obsession" is the first one of Amazon's leadership principles.Bezos isn't the only entrepreneur to glean lessons from working at a fast-food chain.
Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian wasa waiter at Pizza Hut in high school, after working his way up from a dishwasher.As a waiter, "I learned basically everything I've ever needed to know about customer service," Ohanian toldThe New York Times.Barbara Corcoran, star of ABC's "Shark Tank, found similar value working as a waitress in her early 20s.
You learn more in waitressing than you can in any other job," Corcorantells CNBC Make It.
The best job you could have to prepare for entrepreneurship is, walk on the other side of the counter and serve people.
As for Bezos's time at McDonald's, his advice for young people is to always keep your eyes open for lessons to learn at any gig, even it's just flipping burgers.
You can learn responsibility in any job, if you take it seriously," he said in "Golden Opportunity.
You learn a lot as a teenager working at McDonald's," he said.
It's different from what you learn in school.
Don't underestimate the value of that!
